Since I was intelligent enough to go and graduate from the University of Texas::: I am quite capable of making decisions that are in my best interest. I don't need a condescending email from the University telling what precautions I should take while gathering with my family and friends.,"here's a tip. promote and practice healthy living.
because what is going on now is simply embarrassing and will lead to the downfall of humanity.","I went to a football game without masks. I guess you don’t care about COVID when there’s money for you.

With such a “PROGRESSIVE “ and “CLIMATE CONSCIOUS “ campus::: I thought the green house should be thriving and flowing with abundant “SUSTAINABLE “ plant life.

The university gave diversity online training to the white guy who called his coworker a Terrorist.,"You will one day stand before God and answer for everything you have done. How will you do on that day? Here's a quick test: How many lies have you told in your life? Have you ever stolen anything? Have you used God's name in vain? Have you ever looked at someone with lust? Have you had sex outside of marriage? Have you ever had::: or been involved in::: an abortion?

Will you be guilty on Judgment Day? If you have done these things::: God sees you as a lying::: thieving::: fornicating::: blasphemer::: adulterer at heart::: and murderer::: and the Bible warns that God will punish you in a terrible place called the lake of fire: Revelation 21:8::: AV: ""But the fearful::: and unbelieving::: and the abominable::: and murderers::: and whoremongers::: and sorcerers::: and idolaters::: and all liars::: shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.""

Yet God::: who is ""...rich in mercy:::..."" sent His Son the Lord Jesus Christ to suffer and die on the cross for all guilty sinners. We broke God's Law and the Lord Jesus Christ paid our fine. That means God can legally dismiss our case and He can commute our death sentence. John 3:16::: AV: ""For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son::: that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life."" Then the Lord Jesus Christ rose from the dead and defeated death.

Please::: repent and trust in the Lord Jesus Christ as Savior::: and God will give you eternal life as a free gift: Ephesians 2:8-9::: AV: ""For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works::: lest any man should boast.""","Grab your discount & superb papers even if deadlines are strict!

—Statement from President Jay Hartzell

NEWS.UTEXAS.EDU
Statement on Campus Safety from President Jay Hartzell - UT News",2021-11-02 04:41:39,About time!! Also Vote YES to Prop A!! Where is UT’s influence to protect your students in Austin?? Do better UT!,It's way PAST time for this. Thank you for making this effort::: but it should have been done years ago. I'm so thankful my daughter graduated and left West Campus in 2017. It was bad enough she had to live through two horrific and senseless murders during her time at UT. I don't know that I'd want her going to UT today. I fear for the safety of all the kids in west campus.,I hope this statement is put into real action. Parents have begged for an upgraded safety structure for years and feel as though we’ve been ignored. The off campus corridor has continued to deteriorate and the battle over who was responsible fell on deaf ears. I hope this administration has finally heard. Our students love their university::: but many are fearful. There is no reason that the flagship university in Texas::: known for its top level education::: diversity engagement and research development::: should not be rated at the top with student safety. Thank you for finally being the leader and group to take on this mission. We will hold you at your word.,"As a UT parent::: I sure hope these promises will result in action.

Thousands of UT students are forced to live off-campus due to limited housing capacity and they deserve to be safe. Between APD and UTPD::: there needs to be constant::: visible patrols in West Campus and timely responses when students call in.",As my daughter graduates in May::: I’m sad that we’ve battled these safety concerns her entire college career but I’m hopeful for the incoming Longhorns that they will have the safety and security they deserve!,It’s sad that incidents like the ones that just happened a couple of days ago have to happen to wake people up. Our children’s safety should be first priority. Thank you for making these changes::: however you should also make changes to the emergency notification that is sent out to the students to be sent out in a timely manner and not an hour or so after the fact.,Way to go UT! Glad to see this new enhanced safety for the folks at UT! And just so you know::: UTPD has one of the finest::: most respected Law Enforcement agencies around.,Thank you. So glad to hear about these improvements. Our kids have needed a greater police presence in West Campus for some time now. If Austin does not fund their police adequately::: then the university has to step in.,I was at UT from 1992 to 1996 and West Campus was always safe or mostly safe from my experience. Unfortunate to hear of the recent incidents. Stay safe everyone!,Nothing's changed. I remember 10 years ago having to battle the geology department on safety issues when a non-student was roaming the building and disrupting seminars with inappropriate behaviors.,I am a out of state parent and it’s been sad to see how quickly Austin has deteriorated since our first visit to UT two years ago. I really wish the university was more proactive in advocating for student safety with the city officials in Austin.,Please follow through with this. My daughter lives in West Campus and just last night we were discussing her safety. I feel useless to help my child if danger finds her. I’ve given my best advice about safety measures::: and she has a few items for defense. But it’s the University’s responsibility to protect it’s students. Our children need our leaders to follow through. They need to see that they::: and their safety is a priority.,"So let’s see: you’re in the downtown area::: you have no basic restrictions or any gun laws::: anyone can carry guns and you are shocked by someone trying to use a gun in a party store. I mean your Governor basically invited these situations to happen.

The school is basically safe::: it’s just the random person that causes problems in the surrounding area. We have been to the school several times for my daughter and I have never felt unsafe.",My real estate company just purchased a large deteriorated lot and building on W. 24th that has previously been a hot spot for criminal activity. We will be redeveloping that large land lot with new high end luxury apartments that will be gated and have security starting in 2022. That will help clean up that area at least a little bit.,"I’m
so glad I went to UT - class of 1962 - and crime on campus was non existent. It is amazing how quickly our society has deteriorated. Prayers for the safety of all UT students.",Actions speak louder than words and actions are way past due so make it happen NOW!!!,Please have better (immediate) communication between the school and students and parents. What happened Sun should never happen again! We need to have full transparency on these situations. Not an update at 2p the next day.,We are happy to see this post. We are extremely worried for our daughter’s safety. First year living in West Campus and always has exams that finish around 9:30 pm and she walks back from campus. As it gets colder and darker her safety worries us a lot. We are shocked about the recent incidents considering so many students live there. They should not be fearful for their safety and life. Please follow thru with your promise of increased surveillance and patrolling. From reading other parent’s comments::: it looks like it should have been done long back.,“…we recognize that the best outcomes will stem from a coordinated effort between UTPD::: the Austin Police Department and the State Department of Public Safety.” Is their a coalition of spokespersons from each of these law enforcement departments?,I hope things are done to make this campus and surrounding areas safe . Its very distressing to hear of so many shootings so close to where our kids hang out . Our children are our future and UT has some of the brightest young minds in the country . The school and Austin should do everything in their power to make our student safety priority. The last thing they need to worry about is campus safety . This should be a non negotiable priority !,Thank you for officially acknowledging the problems and making a commitment to improving campus safety. We desperately need this!,"We love Austin and The University of Texas at Austin! If you would like to help us make sure our city officials understand our concerns regarding student safety::: please consider signing this petition.

This is an outrage.,A shame that campus police has to pick up the slack where APD has dropped the ball.... Need to keep those kids safe!!! Parents trust that their kids are safe when they pay that tuition!!!!,"One change that would help keep our west campus and campus Longhorns safer is more timely notifications! Receiving notifications an hour or more after the incident is almost useless! A more immediate notification is necessary so students can avoid a specific area or take shelter. What is so difficult about getting timely notifications??
??",Even though West Campus is not UT jurisdiction. Due to limited student housing is in De Facto UT's concern what happens on those blocks. The city and the university should be working together to build a safer environment. Its not only this Sunday's events::: but a constant problem for all students. The student body is a huge economy driver for the city and they deserve better. It has become the wild Wild West Campus and it needs deep discussions and solutions ASAP.,Also agree with other parents about better communication. Students should be notified immediately and not an hour later….that’s ridiculous!!,"I’m beginning to wish our daughter had chosen another school as a few really highlighted extensive safety measures and seemed to have a focus on it. We were thrilled she chose Texas in order to get back to her original home state::: but this needs to get corrected. All I see when we visit our daughter (West Campus) is vagrants all over around the dorms/
apartments and very little law enforcement presence. The students deserve better.",I am glad to hear this. For years simply walking to class from West Campus has posed numerous safety threats to our children. It’s time to increase security patrols and keep our students safe and free from fear.,Start changing the world by making a safer place for your own students!,Thank you. Looking forward to these proactive safety improvements!,Thank you!! Proud UT alum and current parent. The last few days have been overwhelming to say the least. We chose UT for its phenomenal and forward thinking education in a city with so much opportunity. Please help make campus and West campus safer!,Thankful my university is finally stepping up::: but west campus also desperately needs updated lighting and sidewalks. Until west campus is a verified extension of the university::: it continually won’t meet safety standards,Police forces across the Nation are being defunded and the call load is overloaded with calls to 911. I’m glad to see Campus Police used to help the students be more secure and safe.,"Thank you President Hartsell!! I messaged UT Police and Austin PD last night::: as once again my daughter was walking to a chapter meeting at her sorority house and was heckled and followed by individuals that seems to be homeless and/or suffering from mental challenges. It happens almost every time the girls are walking in West Campus. They are chased and have to walk by men openly masturbating in public. Oh and then there was the recent armed robbery at the 7-11 that occurred where the girls were.

Thank you for trying to further safeguard the students!! They need to feel safe on campus and just outside of campus as well.","I’m glad that UT is responding to the situation::: but would like to point out that crime is up::: in general::: in the United States.

For the people that have commented how much Austin had changed in 2 years. Well::: the country has had a terrible last few years.

Crime in the campus area ebbs and flows. I was there in 1977 and we had a serial rapist on the loose. They called him the choker. He used a glass cutter to cut through sliding glass doors or crawled through open windows::: even on 2nd and 3rd floors.

It was definitely frightening.

Thankfully::: he was caught.

Austin is growing into a bigger city and unfortunately there are risks that come with that. Risk can be minimized but not neutralized.",While we as parents appreciate the acknowledgment of concern::: All of these concerns are NOT new.

The University of Texas Vertebrate Paleontology Collections employs an adult male Tokay Gecko as a pest manager to keep cockroaches out of the dermestid beetle room. He is usually pretty reclusive::: but decided to make an appearance for #TongueOutTueday!

The collections use dermestid beetles to clean skeletons for its contemporary bone collection::: with the beetles stripping flesh from bone. Unfortunately::: the dermestid beetles and their meals also attract cockroaches. The lab can't use insecticide since it would kill the dermestids. So they rely on the gecko for pest control.

Have a safe and spooky Halloween 🤘 🎃,2021-10-29 19:21:39,Spooky was watching the Horns get taken to the woodshed by Baylor.,Our Longhorns certainly didn’t feel safe last night when a shooting took place in W Campus and students were in lockdown. Where is the leadership? Why isn’t anything being done to keep our Longhorns safe?? The University of Texas at Austin,Our Longhorn defense is the scariest thing this Halloween… 😳,🤘🏼,Taylor::: TX Neighbors,🤘🏼,Happy Halloween! 🤘,If you call barricading yourself in a room in an academic building and sleeping on the floor all night due to the shooting in West Campus safe::: then I guess it was? 🤷‍♀️,Halloween certainly wasn’t a safe one for many of the west campus students. Where is the leadership??,W campus and campus are far from safe these days. UT leadership please address the crime problem. College students should be able to go out on Halloween rather be put into lockdown. This crime is happening nearly every night; not just on Halloween.,Last night is an example of poor leadership. Last night is an example of a lawless city! Last night is an example of very poor communication between the school::: students and parents. UT is one of the best colleges in the world! UT can do better! If you can’t keep our students safe- gosh forbid get caught in crossfire in west campus because of a bad drug deal::: then maybe new applicants can find schools that can. They will not continue to send students to a school that is not taking care of their students in a “war zone”. We have asked for UT to take action::: the time is now!,As a parent of a West campus resident student::: I am patiently awaiting your response The University of Texas at Austin. Specifically::: I’d like to understand the reasons for the delay in notifications that keep your student population informed and alive. Additionally::: I’d like to know how you’re working with the city and the police department to combat crime that directly impacts the safety of your campus. I am watching and waiting UT. I will hold you accountable for your failure to move expeditiously.,Sadly our students who live on West Campus did not have a safe Halloween. Shootings continue to be a problem and no police presence to patrol or respond to emergencies. Please act now to ensure the safety of our students.,Safe? Where are notifications about shootings that happen on or near campus? Does UT want to pretend all of this isn’t happening? I was there this weekend and didn’t see one police officer on or near west campus. We are UT alums and an out of state family. We love UT but we are definitely having second thoughts about our choice after these first first months of school with so many shootings::: robberies::: sexual assaults happening within a block or two of our daughter’s dorm. I have told friends considering schools to take UT off the list until they can get this figured out. I’m sick about this. UT::: come on!,"Hello all

The freedom to speak::: think and express is at the very heart of any world-class academic institution. Join us this week as we celebrate a commitment to free speech and demonstrate how diverse perspectives are welcomed on campus and are integral to the educational environment: https://utex.as/2IIvPNP,2021-10-18 16:54:27,Thank you. I hope the university truly does honor free speech instead of practicing viewpoint discrimination against conservative speech.,University of Texas at Austin has been given the speech code rating Yellow. Yellow light colleges and universities are those institutions with at least one ambiguous policy that too easily encourages administrative abuse and arbitrary application.,So glad I was at UT 60 years ago. That university is dead now.,That's a reversal from past ultra-liberal behavior. Sorry::: don't believe you. UT changed many years ago::: and no::: it's not better than it was.,Cue all the people who think they should be entitled to spread hate speech and easily debunked Russian propaganda and be taken seriously::: like they’re offering viable truths instead of shredding the fabric of society because outrage gets web traffic and clicks get money. And then once private businesses say they’re not interested in having avowed Nazis or racists as spokespeople::: they’ll scream that THEY’RE the real victims in the whole scenario and cancel culture is prohibiting them from living their best racist lives openly and without any consequence whatsoever for being a professional troll.,So do you allow free speech just one week a year just so you can pretend to tolerate other viewpoints? Every week should be free speech week.,Should Universities invite wackos like Q-followers on campus::: and consider their viewpoints relevant? Should Holocaust deniers and flat earthers be given a platform at UT? I would hope not::: but the commenters in this post may think differently.,Free speech with the possibility of being cancelled... Woo Hoo!,Is Ben Shapiro invited? How about the hosts on FNC and OAN? Glenn Beck? Franklin Graham? Governors Abbott and deSantis? Donald Trump?,Cool,Free Speech Ranking 102 out of 152,If free speech is important why did the University pull an ad by the Lincoln Project from being viewed?,I don't think UT knows what free speech means anymore. #eyesoftexas for example.,"No ""Big Bang"" but bigger.

A coin have 3 sides. Of those 3 sides the edge is the most important. If the edge does not exist::: the coin does not exist.

Let's study the edge.

ReVision: Think backwards in Time.
Backwards in time::: everything disappears from Universe one by one until nothing is left in the known Universe - except neutral elementary particles.

I call it Time of Nothing.

In Time of Nothing::: nothing exist. An explosion cannot occur. No ""Big Bang"" - but even bigger:

The Energy and the Laws of Energy (E)::: that made the neutral elementary particles to move::: to collide::: form atoms::: molecules::: light::: sound::: gases::: liquids::: explosions::: matter::: a s o (E=mc²) came from outside known Universe.

It have many names in history. It is impossible to measure its power::: because it is still making things to disappear and appear in the Universe. I prefer to call it Soul::: simply because it feels::: acts and re-acts according to its own laws.

Because it reacts on actions - for example on Earth it reacts to emissions by its own laws - we know it sens and it is intelligent. A life form - or form of life - without physical appearance::: but we can feel and witness the presence of it every day::: from the different manifestations of it.

An action against its laws always leads to a re-action by it according to its laws. Always.

If you fill a spherical container (space) with gunpowder (neutral elementary particles) and seal it::: it will never explode unless energy from outside make it explode - according to the energy and laws of energy. Simply as that.

If you THINK backwards in time::: you REMEMBER that every present time living human being::: represent all human beings in the history of mankind::: who have made her/his existence possible present time. That's the true age of her/his family line.

All family lines together::: forms the national family line. In the national family line the language of a nation is included. It has been taught first of all by parents to children through the history of mankind. That's the age of every national language.

In biblical terms::: it is called ""Tree of Life"".

Through the ages::: there has been many manifestations by the energy and laws of energy. I call it Soul::: simply because it acts and re-acts according to its own laws. Of dinosaurs::: neanderthalensi
s - whatever you call the extinct life forms;10-15% or less has not been and is not enough to survive a manifestation by the energy and laws of energy.

The answers are out there::: and have always been::: but in order to get the answers::: a good condition of in there is required.

Matti E Simonaho","A lot of work in that field remain::: because every thought and expression present time derive from ""Humans use only 10-15% or less of their total brain capacity"". Some scientists dig the dirt searching for a missing link that does not exist::: because of the missing 85-90%. What have caused the drop from 100% to 10-15%?

- Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans shows that humans use most parts of their brains. ""Humans use only 10-15% or less of their total brain capacity"" is a myth.

fMRI does not show whether the nervous system is connected to right parts of the brain or not. For example:

Love <= connected to => Love
Nervous system is connected correctly. An individuals feelings::: words and deeds are genuine Love. fMRI might show 100% usage.

Love <= connected to => Hate
Nervous system is connected incorrectly. When an individual is in love::: instead of Love::: the feelings::: words and deeds are connected to Hate. fMRI might show 100% usage.

An example.

Bad connection: fMRI #1 here
17 Do not ye yet understand::: that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly::: and is cast out into the draught?
18 But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man.
19 For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts::: murders::: adulteries::: fornications::: thefts::: false witness::: blasphemies:
20 These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man.

Checking
17 ουπω νοειτε οτι παν το εισπορευομενον εις το στομα εις την κοιλιαν χωρει και εις αφεδρωνα εκβαλλεται
18 τα δε εκπορευομενα εκ του στοματος εκ της καρδιας εξερχεται κακεινα κοινοι τον ανθρωπον
19 εκ γαρ της καρδιας εξερχονται διαλογισμοι πονηροι φονοι μοιχειαι πορνειαι κλοπαι ψευδομαρτυριαι βλασφημιαι
20 ταυτα εστιν τα κοινουντα τον ανθρωπον το δε ανιπτοις χερσιν φαγειν ου κοινοι τον ανθρωπον

καρδιας (cardiasis) : means the center of anything that is discussed.

Healing of the nervous system::: making it connect to right parts of the brains.

Good connection: fMRI #2 here
17 Do not ye yet understand::: that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly::: and is cast out into the draught?
18 But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the MIND; and they defile the man.
19 For out of the MIND proceed evil thoughts::: murders::: adulteries::: fornications::: thefts::: false witness::: blasphemies:
20 These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man.

If you sense that “This is right”::: the feeling comes from that a connection to the right places in your brain is established.

Compare fMRI #1 to fMRI #2. Any difference?

Another example.

Current
26 And God said::: Let us make man in our image::: after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea::: and over the fowl of the air::: and over the cattle::: and over all the earth::: and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
27 So God created man in his own image::: in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.

Checking
26 και ειπεν ο θεος ποιησωμεν ανθρωπον κατ εικονα ημετεραν και καθ ομοιωσιν και αρχετωσαν των ιχθυων της θαλασσης και των πετεινων του ουρανου και των κτηνων και πασης της γης και παντων των ερπετων των ερποντων επι της γης
27 και εποιησεν ο θεος τον ανθρωπον κατ εικονα θεου εποιησεν αυτον αρσεν και θηλυ εποιησεν αυτους

Corrected
26 And Gods said::: Let us make man and woman in our image::: after our likeness: and let them take care of the fish of the sea::: and of the fowl of the air::: and of the cattle::: and over all the earth::: and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
27 So Gods created man and woman after their own image::: in the image of Gods created they them; male and female they created.

Conclusion: Each Nation of Man has own male and female Gods.

NEWS.UTEXAS.EDU
UT Austin Adds Student Housing Options to Increase Campus Access::: Affordability - UT News",2021-10-12 16:18:09,I didn't live at Dobie::: but I spent many pleasant hours in various areas of the market with friends.,Lived in Dobie in 1981 on the 23rd floor. Not a bad place to live. Overpriced::: food sucked::: elevators were awful::: but couldn't beat the location. Remember watching lightning storms from my window over the hill country.,I was so happy I lived on the 2nd floor when i was there.. they had a fire and I would have hated that long climb down from the top.,Not really adding a housing option. Just changing the ownership of that housing option,I lived in Dobie on the 26th floor. Used to watch planes land at the old Austin airport. That was 30 years ago (get off my lawn).,God I hated living in the Dobie. They were in the middle of their renovations when I lived there. I lived on the first floor then half way through the year got moved to the top floor. Only one elevator was working for months after I had to move. That and a few other thing made my stay very unpleasant. Great location though. Maybe it’s better now,Hope Braly UT bought Dobie! 🤯 also it looks way cooler than it did when we lived there,I lived in Jester (East and West) and Dobie as an undergrad. Very different dorm experiences when it came to meal quality and shared bathrooms.,This doesn't change the number of available units for students::: just who controls them. Get excited when you have actually added to the total number of rooms. Also::: I hope you added a line item for Bug Bombs. 🪳,Loved Dobie back in 1984. 10 floors below Michael Dell back then. Both our kids stayed at Dobie::: 2011 & 2015...,"Jester and Dobie were being built my senior year. I lived in Roberts Hall two years-\-\no air-conditionin
g and no meal plan available. For a while I ate at Ma Cryer's boarding house-\-\two family-style meals a day for $45 per month-\-\in a run down frame house that was demolished for Dobie or a nearby project. Later I lived in a string of Dickensian ""room to rent"" roach hives ringing the campus. What I thought was a closet in one was the crawl-space under the main house above. My friends and I thought the recently-opened
Castilian and the previews of Dobie were the Waldorf-Astoria
and wondered who on earth would be able to live there. I marvel at the accommodations for UT students these days.",Cool! I used the student credit union in this building and also scared the 💩 out of myself by going to see “Amores perros” at the Dobie Theater right before leaving for my exchange year in Puebla::: MX. This doesn’t add to the number of beds::: but maybe if the University is taking over::: it will be maintained. (Or bulldozed for something modern::: as UT tends to do. 🙄),"I will always remember Dobie as
1. Home to the Hoa Hoa Restaurant::: cheapest Asian student lunch around.
2. Home to a Turkish guy who gave the fastest haircut ever.
3. Home to the scariest parking garage ever. Lol
(I was at UT 2000-2003)",I lived in Dobie in 1973. It opened in 1972.,Lived there 86-87 on the 17th floor. Many fond memories. Loved Dobie theater.,"Bhakti Jadav RahaEstefa LlanosAlexandra Bewley UT owns Dobie now! Interesting…won

f. That Pole Assassin set up a Halloween haunted house for local children to visit at her home?
g. That a child was bitten by Gia at the haunted house?
h. That Pole Assassin blamed the child for being bitten?
No::: all wrong answers so far. The most Texas part of the story is:

It's also sad that the sickness of identitarianism
has gripped the administration.
Quantity was never the point. I hope UT admins pause a little with their obsessive checkmark philosophy and look at students for who they are rather than what the administration thinks they represent.","Rodolfo Reyna-Govea He shouldn't do that and the first amendment doesn't cover that any more than running in to a crowded theater and yelling ""fire!""
A lot of the problem with a lot of profs everywhere::: they suffer from assumption you can teach just because you have a PhD. Some know that::::::but not all. Only one college I know of made its faculty take basic education courses on how to teach. Ed 101::: always remain objective::: never teach opinion::: emphasize student led learning::: never lecture over 10-15 minutes. After that you start losing their attention. Talk to your advisor or dean::: they might switch you to another class. UT '76. 🤘",Consider serving ALL Texans equally - not just certain categories that you want to target. You can’t right the wrongs of the past by simply re-directing your bias and discrimination towards new groups. Admission standards should be equal for ALL - otherwise they are not a “Standard”.,You're still doing plenty to silence dissent::: though.,Let’s see how they graduate. Hoping they succeed.,It is just and fair to serve the one who deserve the most! A proud longhorn,What a racist university!,Are you still looking at students’ academic records when they apply or just their demographic traits?,Admitted as a second semester sophomore::: I was a Student Older Than Average at 24! I am forever indebted to you for allowing me to complete my undergrad degree at UT Austin! Thank you.,"I'll bet a nickel you'll start to see more people ""identifying"" as an under-represent

Hey Zuckerberg::: thanks for clamping on that.🙄,Current TAs reading this headline thinking about how many papers they're about to have to grade,Out with merit...in with labels.,"Imagine getting upset/
angry that UT is serving more underrepresented groups than ever and assuming the non-white students weren’t admitted on merit. What an embarrassment to this country and UT.",So in a state with 38% Hispanics and 11 % blacks::: people have a problem with 25% Hispanic and 5% black class? Shame on you!,"If it’s the “largest” I guess they aren’t underrepresente
d anymore!",How about this Liz. My kids count as minority’s. It is a modern world that we live in! Indeed.,There you go...giving our tax payer money away. How come I had to pay for college?,"This is great but as we can see in the comments::: the racist culture at UT makes it hard for underrepresente
d students to succeed there. I started going to therapy at UT because I had a very racist professor who would use slurs in class and then recite the First Amendment. IF UT is serious about enrollment::: it needs to work on retention by becoming an anti-racist institution and having students at the table when decisions are being made.","Hook 🪝’m Horns!

Hoo!!! Well-deserved celebration for these kids!!!!","In honor of Constitution Day (September 17th)

GEORGE WASHINGTON
Deemed the greatest man in the world by everyone
⁠
George Washington was famous for his humility::: and was revered as the ""Greatest Man in the World"" during his timeline according to scholars::: noblemen::: commoners::: and even the King of Britain whom he defeated in battle. He was also the most famous celebrity throughout the world causing people to line-up throughout the countryside just to see him ride past on his horse.
⁠
What the 400 British ships didn't see when they sailed into New York Harbor to defeat George Washington and his ""ragtag"" untrained Continental Army who were fighting for their independence from England's taxes and laws::: was Washington's faith in God and his humility ― the latter being his most noted characteristic of which people wrote about in their letters and diaries.
⁠
Even the other founding fathers agreed that George Washington was the best of them all::: a man with no formal education.
⁠
After Washington defeated King George III and his army after eight straight years of battling::: the King acknowledged Washington as being the best man in the world for turning down the opportunity to be ordained King (as many people wanted to see happen)::: and also for handing his devoted army back to the Congress which had never before then been done by a winning war General in order for him to return back to his farm and live out the rest of his life privately at his home although later::: he would be pressured to become the first President of the United States of America in order to continue spreading his noble::: wise and humbling influence.
⁠
Washington's army in theory::: should never have won the War for Independence (also called the Revolutionary War)::: but they did even though at times twenty-percent of the army went without shoes or clothing having to endure hot and freezing conditions including walking barefoot through frozen lakes::: cutting their feet on rocks::: and having only to eat ""firecake"" at times which is flour mixed water prepared in a kettle over fire thus causing many of them to die from starvation and disease when Washington somehow never got sick like the others did.

Over the years::: his army came to believe that Washington survived gunfire and disease because he was ordained by a higher-order like when a thick-mist appeared from nowhere blocking out everything in sight allowing the Continental army to escape an attack so they could regroup and strategize.
⁠
George Washington freed all his slaves before he died::: some of them had been inherited from his father during times when even African people were selling their poorest and least educated people under the justification that they weren’t like humans::: because they were primitive in culture and tradition.
⁠
It’s unfortunate that Washington::: and all the other good people couldn’t have afforded to purchase all the slaves and give them dignified jobs::: beautiful places to live::: and an educations like many did::: but there were about four million slaves in the end and nobody was rich enough to purchase them all::: especially after the invention of the Cotton Gin which rose America to being the producer of about three quarters of the world’s cotton.

This amassed some of the biggest fortunes during those times which caused many evil and greedy people to raise the price of slaves to 7 or 8 times higher AND it also posed more danger to slaves overall when talking about abolishing slavery during a time when the people making fortunes from it were never more power hungry who would rather see the slaves killed than become free as proven when they hunted down slaves after they were freed.
⁠
Washington's great friend Billy Lee was a black slave that Washington purchased and saved from a potentially horrible fate.
Billy Lee::: rode aside Washington for the 8-years they fought together as a best man and friend.
⁠
Fritz Hirschfeld a historian wrote that::: ""If Billy Lee had been a white man he would have had an honored place in American history because of his close proximity to George Washington during the most exciting periods of his career. But because he was a black servant::: a humble slave::: he has been virtually ignored by both black and white historians and biographers.”
⁠
George Washington::: top scholars::: innovators::: and the founding father’s who worked on developing the U.S. Constitution knew that the Constitution was better than them selves::: and that it was the best attempt to give power to the people NOT the evil that will ALWAYS find itself employed in government.
⁠
They all knew the slaves must be freed for the Constitution to become all that it was written to be::: but knew a gradual approach to freeing the slaves was the best way to protect them from being killed::: and to plan for their integration into society as free and equal people.

Many Africans came to America of their free will settling first in Portland::: the melting post of vast religions::: languages::: and foreign cultures getting along together and excited to be living and exploring the ""new world"" of which they didn't originally know was already inhabited by hundreds of Indian tribes::: some unfriendly like the Shawnee who captured and tortured one of Daniel Boone's sons to death::: and were known for scalping the much different looking foreigners.

Many of the tribes were friendly and showed the foreigners how to grow food and navigate through the uncharted and dangerous terrain::: some of them even partnered with the British by guiding them through forestry during the war.

Washington called the Constitution “The Great Experiment” and I personally believe it is worth dying for::: just like our Bible is and ancient history which have been removed from public education.⁠
⁠
GEORGE WASHINGTON QUOTES:⁠
⁠
“The fate of unborn millions will now depend::: under God::: on the conduct and courage of this army.”⁠
⁠
To be prepared for war is one of the most effective means of preserving peace.”
⁠
“Government is not reason and it is not eloquence. It is force! Like fire it is a dangerous servant and a fearful master. Never for a moment should it be left to irresponsible action.”
⁠
“It should be the highest ambition of every American to extend his views beyond himself::: and to bear in mind that his conduct will not only affect himself::: his country::: and his immediate posterity; but that its influence may be co-extensive with the world::: and stamp political happiness or misery on ages yet unborn.”
⁠

A large well-run study from Israel confirms that people with a prior SARS2 infection have vastly stronger immunity to both subsequent infection as well as hospitalization
as compared to people who had received two doses of the Pfizer vaccine (but had not had prior exposure).

A third group which had both prior infection and a single jab did somewhat better than either of the other two groups.

This argues conclusively that prior infection can be and should be a basis for vaccine exemption. As always::: if the data changes::: so will we.

But for sure::: we can say that it’s not as simple as being either vaxxed or unvaxxed. There’s a third group in the mix and that’s people who have already had a SARS2 infection and recovered. They are a far safer group than the vaxxed in that they don’t get reinfected as much as the vaxxed::: and they don’t go to the hospital nearly as often.

So the hyperbolic vaxxed crowd calling for the unvaxxed to suffer::: or pay more::: or even - in some grotesque examples - suffer and die is entirely misplaced::: inappropriate::: and vile.

"The entire UT community is excited to welcome students back to the Forty Acres.

As you know::: the COVID-19 situation across Texas::: and particularly in Austin::: remains serious. We are closely monitoring the data::: and with the advice of our public health experts::: we have decided to allow some professors to make temporary adjustments to their classes to reduce density through September 17.

These adjustments will not affect every class::: and professors will communicate any adjustments to directly to students.

As you return to campus::: we recommend wearing masks and getting vaccinated. This is the most effective way to ensure we can enjoy a normal fall semester.

Read more about these changes from Provost Sharon Wood:

PROVOST.UTEXAS.EDU
Reduced Classroom Density - Office of the Executive Vice President and Provost",2021-08-18 18:11:43,So disappointed to hear this. If public schools can be face to face and you can fill your stadium for football games::: for God’s sake give my son the education he’s paying for::: not the shadow of classes he got from you last year.,That's good news 👍 students do need to be back in the classroom as long as they are vaccinated and wearing the mask is mandated...,So we can have football games with packed stadiums and ACL and concerts::: but moody doesn’t get a graduation and classrooms of 35 students can’t meet in person? Sure::: that makes sense,I work in a high school and we are FULL in person with 3500 kids. Last year was students choice but we were IN PERSON all year while my engineering daughter I paid full tuition and RENT for was home all year doing zoom. I brought her home because the isolation was not good for her mental health. She’s vaccinated::: will wear a mask and hell::: stand on her head for in-person classes. Why can high schools do it but universities can’t? I’m in Houston too::: our rate is not low. It’s ridiculous 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️,Take care of yourselves::: and UT community. Covid is extremely bad right now. Do not underestimate its power. Do whatever you have to do.,So we’re still packing out the stadium for football games::: though...right?,Mandate the vaccine and mask we loves our kids🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻,Encourage your student upload their COVID-19 vaccine card. The school believes only 57% of the students are vaccinated. Everybody submit their vaccine cards will proof it is a lot higher than 57%.,Without a uniform policy for the entire university::: with these temporary changes being different for each class::: this is going to be a logistical nightmare. I also think it's going to be really confusing::: esp to our younger students::: who will likely have a different modality for each class. I wish the university had just dome something similar to what UTSA did and have a uniform policy for all classes.,School should require vaccines for all who want to attend in person -full stop. This resistance is total stupidity.,I recommend a mask mandate. Not everyone can get the kind of healthcare the governor does.,While I understand the economic reality of the situation::: i think there is no way this will end well.,Vaccine needs to be mandated.,Fine::: y'all don't want to have facemask or can't impose a vaccine mandate::: but why not try to be creative instead? perhaps additional tuition help if you get a vaccine? wear a UT branded face mask and get a free meal?,How tactical to announce this after many students have already moved into dorms and UT owned apts. Par for the course.,Great idea::: thanks for thinking of our children and staff as we have this spike in numbers.,Texas Ex here. Mandates are in order.,Question on expelled West Point communism student we hired as a professor? Explanation??,"To the University of Texas Libraries.

Dear Sir Or Madame:::

my name is Jacopo Martelli. I am interested in topics related to history and military strategies.

I’d like to ask you if you have this map in the book: The Scottish geographical magazine 1896 Gold Coast Colony 1896.

From the Scottish Geographical Magazine. Published by the Royal Scottish Geographical Society and edited by James Geikie and W.A. Taylor. Volume XII::: 1896:

I wanted to ask if it was possible to scan in the highest possible resolution in file format ( pdf or other formats ). Because I can’t read the notes. They are too blurry.

Thank you for your help.

Yours faithfully.

P.s. I need the best graphic resolution because I have to read the names of small towns well. I need this map for my university exam. I ask you for this courtesy.

And If possible in color::: not black and white. Thanks",I am so confused. Masks are or are not being required? What about other schools in the UT System::: ex. UT Tyler?,Please make booster shots available to students and faculty as soon as possible if you’re planning for in person classes of whatever density.,Can someone help!were do the new students pick up dorm keys and checkin??,"I am immeasurably disappointed with the lack of science-based decisions the university has been making.

To say nothing of the spinelessness. President Powers fought Governor Perry head on::: every time::: because he knew what was in the best interest of the university community.

After years of placating to wealthy donors’ opinions on school songs::: to see university leadership fold to politics when your students need you the most::: is heartbreaking to the core. The university is acting like a shadow of its former self.",It is critical that this be temporary. Students need to be back to classroom::: in person learning.,🤦‍♀️🙄,Sure reduce class sizes::: but cram 100k in to the stadium on game day. 🤣🤣🤣,Madison Wilson,Maryanne LaCroix,"Vanessa Jimenez the comments here rofl XD

Thanks for nothing::: our dumbass governor 😂",Just require the vaccine FFS.,"So I continue to pay Out of State tuition for online classes. This makes it sound like SOME classes will be online for SOME students. Well my daughter is starting her SENIOR year with EVERY SINGLE ONE of her classes online. Just like last year.

So glad this was done AFTER we paid for the semester. This is not what we signed up for.",This is so disappointing. We were so excited when out daughter was accepted to UT 2 years ago. The majority of her time has been isolated in her apartment in expensive West Campus. Tuition is expensive and we signed a lease again believing she would have in person classes for her last year at UT. Three of her four classes are online at the last minute.,Have some balls (& common sense!) & make masks & vaccines mandatory! You made me get another damn measles shot when I was in my 30s! I didn't whine & cry about it!,most effective way is to get vaccinated ? shame on you UT for not following the science and placing your students at risk,What a disappointment!,"I’m confused- I thought you are allowing hybrid situations to reduce density until Sept 17 case by case. But::: it seems like many professors are going completely online. My daughter’s professor emailed yesterday that she is going completely online until mid to end of October at least. Her husband is immune compromised. I understand her concerns::: but she knew about this before yesterday(shoul
d have always been online). She should have given the students a choice when signing up. Covid has not gone away and she decided to tell them yesterday). Just like last year. So disappointing:(
the last year and 1/2 has been online- this needs to end now!","https://

"We're excited to welcome the UT community back to the Forty Acres this fall 🤘😷

As you get ready to return to campus::: please note these important adjustments we've made:

- Masks: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recently updated their guidance. We adopted this guidance::: and therefore::: face masks are recommended::: but optional::: inside university buildings for vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals::: except when alone in a private office or single-occupant cubicle.

- Vaccinations: Getting vaccinated is the best protection for you and your fellow Longhorns. We encourage all members of our community to get vaccinated if you are able to do so.

Please note that the university is prohibited from inquiring about the vaccination status of any individual (student::: staff::: or faculty). Therefore::: faculty may not poll their class regarding their vaccination status and faculty must treat all students equally::: regardless of their vaccination status.

- Testing: For your safety and the safety of our community::: we have determined that all students coming to campus for the fall semester must receive a viral test (antigen test or a nucleic acid amplification test such as PCR) in their local community within 72 hours (3 days) prior to arrival in Austin for your move in.

Students::: if you already reside in Austin::: please test within 72 hours (3 days) prior to moving into the residence where you will reside for the academic semester. Students who are already living in the residence in Austin where they will reside this academic semester should test within 72 hours (3 days) prior to the start of class on Aug. 25. Students who will be living in on-campus residence halls::: 2400 Nueces and the University Apartments have received a message on a separate process for testing and should refer to that guidance.

The testing decision was made based on the rising numbers of positive COVID-19 cases in Texas and the City of Austin::: and analysis from our university’s public health experts. These experts recommend all of our students get tested to help protect the UT Austin community by identifying and preventing cases brought to campus from outside our community.

- We are continuing our Proactive Community Testing program which is available to students::: faculty and staff. Resources are available to help students who test positive to navigate isolation::: assist with absence notifications for class and provide additional supports. These students are directed to contact the Behavior Concerns and COVID-19 Advice Line (BCCAL) for this support.

- We’re asking all students::: faculty and staff use the Protect Texas Together app for daily symptom screening before arriving on campus each day::: which will help make the campus community safer if you don’t have a smartphone::: a phone-based application is also available.

- Staff members should contact their supervisors for more information about flexible work arrangements.

- Updated Guidance for Immunocompromised Individuals and Family Members: Immunocompromised individuals are most at risk from COVID-19. Individual faculty and staff members should submit their requests for accommodations for their own medical conditions through the ADA accommodation process at https://equity.utexas.edu/employee-accommodations/. For guidelines on immunocompromised and other medical conditions::: please refer to the CDC guidelines.

Finally::: we ask that in the days leading up to your arrival in Austin — or if you are already in Austin::: the days leading up to the first day of class — please limit your contact with others outside your household to reduce the likelihood that you will be exposed to or contract the virus.

Visit protect.utexas.edu to find more information for students::: faculty and staff::: including the answers to frequently asked questions and more: https://protect.utexas.edu/

Protect Texas Together - Protect Texas Together",2021-08-09 21:27:24,Austin has 6 (six!!) available icu beds for 2.5 million people. You better hope your student doesn’t need it because of an auto accident or some other reason. You’re playing with fire by not mandating masks and vaccinations like top universities in other states have done. Shame on you::: Greg Abbott.,Thank you UT for doing what you can. Thank you for requiring testing. I hope that you follow Dallas ISD and mandate masks.,Several large public Texas K-12 school systems are requiring masks::: despite the governor’s mandate: Houston::: Austin::: San Antonio::: Dallas::: and now Fort Worth. I work at a private university that just announced a mask requirement. So::: it is not too late for UT to follow suit.,So you can carry a gun on campus but you can’t ask someone if they are vaccinated? Come on Texas::: you can do better than that. Good luck and please keep those students safe.,Thank you for being rational and not basing your decisions on fear.,What an embarrassment for UT to not require masks or to be vaccinated! Thanks Greg Abbott! 🤦‍♀️,"Shame… that UT doesn’t have the guts to make it mandatory…
Allows political driven Abbott to dictate nonsense …",Lol at all of the people ripping on Governor Abbott for giving students a CHOICE he didn’t say not to get the vaccine it is just a choice. So if you want it go get it::: and if you don’t then don’t. Quit trying to rule peoples lives. If you do have the vaccine quit complaining and live your life because it shouldnt matter to you anymore.,It’s unfortunate that the governor made it impossible to mandate vaccinations for students. I hope you are using your influence behind the scenes to push him on this.,Are parents still allowed to help their kids move in,As TEX told us back in the 90’s…”Goodbye and good luck.” 🧡🤘,Seems y’all are depending a lot on trust in the individual::: but they have not proven to be “trustworthy”…😢,"Deaths and hospitalization
s ahead…",Negative test results are only valid while the student is at the testing site. Ridiculous measures.,What about kids that just moved in because they are getting ready for rush? Nothing was mentioned to them.,So even fully vaccinated students need a negative test?,Was visiting campus last Monday . How I miss it. Hook'em!,Text from Malaysia. You are a top univ::: act and behave as one. Apply science and not politics. Former ex-UT,Glad too see some reasonable policies put in place.,"Thank you for accommodating those who are immunocompromis
ed",Thank you for the detailed information. Hook ‘Em!! 🧡🤘🏻,How is off campus housing being handled? Same testing requirement?,The University of Texas at Austin::: so will the rapid antigen test work?,Will 100% remote learning be an option this semester?,"All these “recommendation
s” should be mandatory::: if not for our “Gov”🙄",This is what a responsible university COVID protocol should look like. I hope UT Austin administration reconsider its policy and follow evidence-based medicine instead of politics.,"No mask or vax mandates. Just more appeasement to the pseudoscience crowd and outright cowardice from the University of Texas administration.
Sadly::: this fits right in with the SEC::: which was the deeper plan all along. A moral and intellectual disgrace. And I am an alum with MA and PhD from UT.",Masks and vaccines should be required for the safety of students::: faculty and staff!! 😡,UT needs to mandate the Covid vaccine the instant FDA changes the authorization from EUA to permanent.,Vote Abbott out- he has failed Texas again! Masks need to be mandated-,"What are the physical fitness standards gonna be?
I wonder if that helps the immune system.",Yeh. And I know those 40 acres. Like the back of my hand. The nursing school was by the SEC. Good thing was my mom was waiting for me in the parking lot::: we had lunch and then bought James Avery jewelry. Lol,"I quit my job at UT Austin due to severe inflexibility for individual needs. I gave y’all fourteen years of my life and you couldn’t me an inch for the health and safety of my too-young-to-be
-vaccinated children. This alumna will return that favor by never donating another penny to this one proud institution.",This is shameful and disappointing. Please require vaccinations and masks.,"Time to take a stance and defy Abbott’s orders that put us all at risk.

I expect decisions to be made based on the best available science::: not some fool’s political aspirations.",What starts here changes the world!!! Start vaccine walk up clinics::: mandate masks and provide testing. Are you science based? Change to world!!!!,Allison Carpenter,Absurd. Outbreaks are already happening on campus. 50:::000+ students are about to arrive on campus during the peak of delta variant while our city is nearly out of ICU beds. Is it only a matter of time before these reckless policies shut the whole campus down? Bottom line: UT is not keeping its students::: faculty::: or staff safe.,good luck 🤘,You inquire about a meningitis shot status. What makes this different?,you should sign on with your bretheren that are mandating masks in the austin school district. right thing to do,Texas Ex here. Shame on you for not having the guts to require masks on campus and require vaccinations. Tests help short term. Once those students begin to interact maskless and unvaccinated get ready for a real problem. Too bad idiots are running the state government and your hands seem to be tied by them. Shameful that the educated stand by and do nothing::: while Austin’s hospitals overflow and the numbers soar in Texas again.,Hi UT::: have you changed your mask policy yet?,So I’m expected to sit shoulder to shoulder with up to hundreds of other students who aren’t required to wear a mask and then go home to my one year old who is obviously not eligible for a vaccination. I've only received one vaccination and can’t get the other until 9/5::: but even if i was vaccinated haven't they determined you can still pass it to others? How does it make sense that back when it was almost exclusively impacting elderly and immune compromised individuals we stayed home but now that it’s actually killing younger people we’re going back and not even enforcing masks? And what’s one test before class starts gonna do? Prove I may be kinda protected for the first week but then on my own after that? UT SA is doing all virtual the first month::: why aren’t we? For my families safety I'm seriously considering withdrawing for the semester because nothing is worth risking my son's life.,They never show us the SCIENTIFIC STUDIES TO PROVE anything about covid.,"#defeatcommunism #standards #friday #truthmatters Lieutenant Colonel Heffington is addressing the US Military Academy's failure to identify::: reject::: and dismiss former Lieutenant Spenser Rapone::: who was also a prior enlisted Ranger-qualifie
d soldier who infiltrated the Army to sabotage it. His acceptance into the US Military Academy was under a previous administration that was soft on communism.

"Under the health equity core competency::: Dell Medical School - UT Austin students will learn about the historical context of discrimination::: how to recognize structural and social determinations of health::: and structures of oppression within medicine.

They'll also learn how to identify their own biases and privileges; how to build relationships with a diverse group of people; and how to work with community-based partnerships.

Dell Medical School adds health equity as one of its primary focuses for students' curriculum",2021-07-18 13:00:30,What an absolute waste! How about they focus on patient care and education and leave the rest of this crap out of it!,Good. Since the Republicans wanna take MLK and Caesar Chavez out of the damn textbooks in the name of some bullshit theory THAT WAS NEVER TAUGHT IN THE FIRST PLACE,Funny how people who are not affected by health discrimination find this to be a problem. I'm sure that's just a coincidence though.,So glad I chose to not continue down the medical path. Tired of the political pandering.,Texas humans are nuts::: based on the comments. Thank you Dell for common sense.,So CRT does exist on ut campus. I’ll be warning my friends,I hope they learn medicine as well.,Do they take away points from the students with higher scores and give them to students with lower scores... you know::: for more equity?,This post on my timeline was followed by VA Cares Health tips. This could fix the VA Healthcare System that has failed our nation's heroes for decades. But I see this only fitting into civilian Healthcare and being used by the wealthy. Poor people and Veterans still will have the worst Healthcare and facilities across the board.,Soo.. many people on here are showing how they don't know how social injustices show up medical practices and then talking how learning about it is nonsense. Y'all should be ashamed.,Understanding how various circumstances affect their patients IS patient care!,I hope they learn how to cure disease,I think it’s great other than identifying their privileges part. Is one supposed to feel bad for having these so-called privileges? How exactly is privileges defined? Does it mean you had food on the table? Live in a trailer? Live in a nice brick house? Have a pool? Have a backpack? Attend a school? Live in a van? Breathe air? I ask because growing up I was told to appreciate what I had and count my blessings. My parents were young and didn’t always have it easy. But super hard work::: blood and tears paid off. I do think healthcare is a human right and everyone deserves care::: doctors and nurses should care for everyone and we should all have empathy for those who have less than us in life::: but I don’t understand how whatever we think are privileges plays into this. I had a relative who died of cancer because she couldn’t afford chemotherapy and no hospital would give her chemotherapy for free. But she was still privileged because she wasn’t a person of color? She lost her life because of money::: not race or privileges. I’ve had to work hard for every privilege I have. So once I “ recognize” them::: what am I supposed to do with that??,Heres my issue with all of this::: historically race is not consodered or judged on if the generation is raised with no regard to it::: but generations raised with the theme that races are are inherently different privileged has just led to propagated racism and race tension. This is a conclusion I round in 2 years of psychology and sociology research classes,Hopefully also learning to be excellent doctors learning all that critical science stuff.,Yes::: their own biases and privileges. But only when those biases affect one group of people. Being biased against a different group of people is OK !,Just don’t tell the anti-Critical Race Theory folks about this. They’ll go out of their way to make this illegal.,Can you not treat patients as patients? Treat Human Bodies as Human Bodies! No one is asking a Cardiologist to treat patients like a Shrink.,is that a core competency? Seems like supporting education::: not to belittle the study.,Teachers just teach how to save lives.,Good job Austin,Can't they do this in undergrad?,Smh......,👍🏼,People having a cow here...you're not smart enough to get into UT. So please take a seat.,Liberal 💩 hole!😳,Brent Skinner,Good Work Dell Medical School - UT Austin!,More leftist BS.,Yeah let's let someone who has made good decisions about their health suffer so that someone who made poor choices about their health live so that we can achieve equity. WTF? Canceled.,Every woman on this post should be glad for this. Everyone who’s not a yt cishetero man has been grievously harmed by biases and discrimination.,"Context:

Last year::: Lockheed Martin Corporation::: the nation’s largest defense contractor::: sent white male executives to a three-day diversity-train
ing program aimed at deconstructing their “white male culture” and encouraging them to atone for their “white male privilege:::”

The seminar::: run by an organization called ‘White Men As Full Diversity Partners’ lays out its theory of privilege. The firm’s founders::: Welp and Bill Proudman::: have argued that white males must “work hard to understand” their “white privilege:::” “male privilege:::” and “heterosexual privilege:::” which affords them unearned benefits. The firm’s training programs are designed to assist white men in discovering the “roots of white male culture.” That culture::: according to Welp and Proudman::: consists of traits—such as “rugged individualism:::”
“a can-do attitude:::” “hard work:::” “operating from principles:::” and “striving towards success”—which are superficially positive but are “devastating” to women and minorities.

So instead of “working hard” etc. white males should be irresponsible::: liars::: theives and lazy.

"New research shows physical punishment of children::: like spanking::: isn't effective:

NEWS.UTEXAS.EDU
Evidence Against Physically Punishing Kids Is Clear::: Researchers Say - UT News",2021-06-30 20:00:02,We all do the best we can with the information available to us at the time. We all carry the burden of decisions we made in the past that we no longer agree with and parenting is no exception to that. This isn’t the first time scientific evidence against “spanking” has been published and it certainly won’t be the last. Now that you have access to the information::: you can make an informed decision. For those interested in seeking another way to parent::: Conscious Discipline is a great place to start.,Literally all of you are the problem. There’s clear research in your face and you’re still denying it. Maybe the issue isn’t with the younger generations but it’s with the older ones. You all think that you’re right and refuse to see the facts. Besides the older generations are causing the problems. Not the younger ones.,The issue isn’t with the younger generations. The issue is with the older ones. They demand respect without giving any back. The older ones think they’re entitled to everything. The old generations are the ones that berate and insult the younger ones. The issue is not the younger ones but it is the older ones.,"We had plenty trees in the yard that got trimmed on a regular basis...switch if the belt wasn't available and I tell you what if more of that was going on there wouldn't be so much disrespect happening right now. Trust me it was very effective in our upbringing my parents were NOT and still NOT tolerating disrespect and misbehavior...l
ol","Go to Walmart any given day and watch how kids behave. I’ll hear parents counting::: 1:::2:::3:::4….
Back in my day I didn’t get a count.. just a butt busting in the store.. in front of everybody…Dad and Mom didn’t tolerate misbehavior..!",Worked for me and worked for my son! I can count on one hand how many spankings he had to get when he was young!,"There is such hostility directed towards expertise::: experience::: and science on the right (and the comments here are a prime example). It’s no wonder we’re are such a mess.

I’m thankful to God for the research and innovation taking place at UT. What happens at Texas changes the world (for the better)!!!","It's not about ""Physical Punishment""::: nor ""Hitting""::: nor ""Spanking""::: It's about ""Discipline"" to your kids::: to produce good productive well-behaved citizens...",Agreed. I think my parents would have found other discipline methods if they knew what I would remember about them after they were gone. Yeah::: it was bad.,Being a kind parent shouldn’t be a reach.,Lack of self control resorts to hitting children. Those that still support this mentality were spanked themselves and have yet to realize a better way. Choosing to discipline without hitting is not raising weak or difficult children::: choosing not to parent properly is.,Have you seen the cry baby Nation we have right. Come one research and science used to say lsd and cocaine was good for you. There is a difference between beating your child and spanking you child. It's not alway the right way to go but it's definitely a part of discipline.,I kept waiting for the article to say how they know spanking didn’t work or how behavior became worse. Seems like it just kept saying::: “The study showed…” but didn’t say how::: exactly::: spanking had negative outcomes.,I love how people keep referring to “the researcher” in an attempt to discredit this data. The study was an analysis of almost 70 studies—not the opinion of one disgruntled researcher. Did any of you go to college? Do you not know how science works? But go ahead and keep hitting your kids…this is America after all!,Ummmmm I got swats and spankings when I was a kid and all I have to say is is that if it wasn’t for my parents doing that I wouldn’t be a hardworking Man and I wouldn’t be where I am today without that kind of discipline. Sorry I Love UT but I have to disagree obviously you shouldn’t beat your kids that’s wrong but spankings and swats aren’t a bad thing. My parents taking my stuff away did nothing to me so the only way was for them to give me swats and it worked because I hated that and I learned my lessons and I’m grateful I had Loving parents to teach me right from wrong and actually taught me discipline. My generation is so weak,More touchy-feely GARBAGE from the weenies that populate UT Austin... This study belies MILLENNIA of practical experience on a daily basis::: not to mention most people's personal experience. What a pitiful joke this kind of study is...,There’s a difference between a spank and a beaten. And you wonder why we have so many mass shootings,"Just gonna leave this right here........
“Only five research studies have restricted their definition of spanking to open-handed swats on the bottom::: [and] none of them found any harmful effects of spanking:::” Robert Larzelere::: Ph.D.::: a parenting professor and researcher at Oklahoma State University who has authored numerous papers about discipline and spanking since the 1980s::: told Fatherly. “And four studies found it to be tied for first place as the most effective way to enforce cooperation with timeout in defiant 2- to 6-year-olds.”",One spanking from my Dad was all it took to straighten me out.,I hope the education that you provide is much better than your advice!,I doubt the researchers have children. They are probably cat people.,"Lol at everyone here who has to beat their children to teach them. Do you punch your co-workers or employees if they mess up? No? Because maybe they'd hit you back or press charges? And you're calling people who put in the extra effort to teach right from wrong versus instilling fear of violence a bunch of pussies?? No bigger pussy than someone who has to hit a child to ""teach"" them something.",And this is what’s wrong with kids today!!!,Everyone commenting some form of “I got hit::: and I turned out just fine” most assuredly did not.,"It sure worked on me. Most of today's parents don't spank their kids::: and that proves that not spanking them and sending them to time out::: isn't effective either. Now::: when they reach their late teens and adulthood::: ""time out"" is nothing more than sitting in prison for a few years. No Problem!",This is literally some of the worse propaganda BS I’ve seen. They cite none of the evidence that’s so “compelling”. Where is it?,The trophy generation that never got hit. They feel entitled to everything.,Worked fine on me. Anything I got swats for::: I never did it again.,ITT people justify why their parents committed violent acts against them::: by using examples of how they turned out and seeing some kids acting out a handful of times while ij public,Take a long look at kids today and repeat your statement slowly.,No butt swats is why college kids today have to have “safe spaces”.,BS Discipline is not abuse. Or should we lock them in cages like in jail?,How does one research this?,What a joke... biased::: slanted::: agenda driven research. Nothing to see here::: move along.,More BS from the powder puffs,Spare the rod spoil the child,"My rough upbringing made me the warrior I am today. I served my country. I keep my body fit. I am successful at life. I push through adversity like a knife through butter.

I would not have had life any other way. No amount of soft coddling will produce strong men willing to do the hard things necessary to be leaders and protectors of those they care about.",That's pretty much garbage since that's the age range of 50 and 60 year olds before the dont touch your child mentality took hold. Yet those 50 and 60 year olds are better disciplined and socially astute and wage earners.,So says researchers who were never spanked . Typical Austin Jibba Jabba,I guess it’s best to just let kids do and get away with whatever they want🤷🏼‍♂️,As someone who was spanked... BULLSHIT! It worked. I wasn't abused. I was punished. And I never did whatever got me a spanking again.,"Spank their asses.....Hook'
em","All the evidence I need is to compare people of previous generations to people of my generation and those that came after me.

Spanking works. Period. No amount of new-age pseudo-psycholo
gy “science” will override the simple fact that millennials and beyond generally suck when it comes to basic manners::: respect::: and decency.",If more of this younger generation would have been spanked::: they wouldn't be getting in trouble with the law so much and wouldn't be so disrespectful..,That's a lie. Education thur physical education is a form of LAW. imagine IOUs on discipline...,This reminds me of seeing kids running around fucking up the shelves in walmart and throwing themselves on the ground.... yeah my mom didn't have to whoop us often but she had a look that meant straighten the fuck up or else. And I'm totally fine... I have three kids and have never had to do more than raise my voice and they know shit is real. If kids have no consequences for their actions they grow up to be like hunter biden.... lmao,"Shocker this ""research"" came from Austin.",Said the researcher who hated getting spanked. Losers will come up with loser things,Only in Austin….,Our country is now seeing what happens when you don’t spank your kids.,"I got 2 kids here that say otherwise......
spare the rod...spoil the child",Lol and the world is a shit show. Full of “how do you feel about that” 🙄.,EVERY spanking I got as a child::: I earned. Not only did I earn it::: I wasn't going to learn any other way. Is spanking the answer to every behavioral issue? No. Did it make me bitter or abusive? No.,"There's a difference between beating your kids and using physical discipline in conjunction with words of both correction and affection.

All you folks who were spanked as a kid and consider yourselves better for it::: please stand up. I count myself among you.

After all::: ""He who withholds his rod hates his son::: But he who loves him disciplines him diligently.""",Everytime a study like this is posted::: I see SO many adults who post about how THEY were hit and they DESERVED it and it was a good thing that they got hit as children. I'm so so sorry this happened to yall. Do you hear yourselves? Are you capable of stepping back and realizing how you sound?,"sorry UT::: but the ongoing attempts to make this claim and foist this dogma on us has now born it’s fruit for anyone paying attention the last 50 years…even a casual observation of the antics of the definitely-not-
spanked 20-40 year old set over the last 18 months in particular::: is revelatory as to what the anti-spanking experiment (courtesy of decades of psychology and research “scientist” community garbage) has achieved in our country/
culture…and the outcome isn’t a yield of responsible::: respectful::: productive::: emotionally healthy::: well-equipped and capable citizens…this experiment is a complete and proven train-wreck…we do indeed have our own eyes and the emperor indeed has no clothes…and he has now adult brats for kids whom have little hope of ever reaching adult level psychological/
emotional maturity due to parental negligence",I wonder how many of these researchers actually have kids,Yeah you see how well thats working the today's youth lol,"😂😂😂😂

However::: in discussing racial issues::: it is vital we deal in facts and not propaganda.

Let's start by debunking the 1619 fraud. Supporters of the 1619 Project claim Blacks should be placed at the center of the story about America because their contributions to America were so massive. The authors believe blacks are responsible for America’s “economic might::: its industrial power::: its electoral system::: diet::: popular music::: its legal system.” These authors believe “That black Americans::: as much as those men cast in alabaster in the nation’s capital::: are this nation’s true ‘‘founding fathers.’’

The authors of the 1619 curriculum are in COMPLETE DELUSION.

"The university is issuing new masking guidance consistent with both the governor’s executive order and recent guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Effective immediately::: our guidance will be as follows:
• Masks are optional inside university buildings and outdoors.
• For individuals who are not fully vaccinated or have weakened immune systems::: masking and social distancing are optional but recommended.

As we have done since the beginning of the pandemic::: the university will continue to monitor conditions and act accordingly in line with the guidance of the CDC and state officials as those continue to evolve.

What is the photon emitted by the hydrogen atom?

“Because the electron is a photon around Dark Matter::: the electron receives and emits photons with the speed of light”
Adrian Ferent

At what velocity does an electron emits a photon?
Feynman's wrong answer to the question:
“An electron emits an ordinary photon in response to being struck by a reverse-time (""advanced"") photon that has traveled backward in time from some point in the future.”Some point in the future"" could range from femtoseconds (or less) away up to billions of years in the future. The real photon that is emitted in response to the recoil-inducing

me photon travels along the classical time path as a normal or ""retarded"" photon (no I did not make that up)::: and eventually strikes the very same target that emitted the advanced photon sometime in the future.”

“The Ferent mechanism gives the electron Mass::: not the wrong Higgs mechanism”
Adrian Ferent

I discovered that:

“The electron is not an elementary particle::: because it is composed of a Photon and a Dark electron”
Adrian Ferent

“The photon confined inside the electron has mass and electric charge”
Adrian Ferent

“The Standard Model is wrong because the electron is not an elementary particle::: and it does not include Dark Matter particles”

You learned that the photon seems to be a point-like particle since it is absorbed or emitted as a whole by arbitrarily small systems::: including systems much smaller than its wavelength::: such as an atomic nucleus (≈10−15 m across) or even the point-like electron.

A hydrogen atom is an electrically neutral atom and contains a single positively charged proton and a single negatively charged electron bound to the nucleus by the Coulomb force.

Electrons have a negative electric charge of −1.602176634×10
^(−19) coulombs.
Electrons have a negative magnetic moment -1.0011B
The magnetic moment of the proton is parallel to its spin.

Electromagnetic
waves are emitted by electrically charged particles undergoing acceleration:::

The interaction between two photons.

An electromagnetic
wave consists of a coupled oscillating electric field and magnetic field which are always perpendicular to each other.
According to quantum mechanics::: electromagnetic
waves can also be viewed as streams of particles called photons.

Electric and magnetic fields obey the properties of superposition.

Proof for my theory:

Electron–positr
on pair production: the photon's energy is converted to particle mass.
The photon must have higher energy than the sum of the rest mass energies of an electron and positron for the electron–positr
on pair production to occur.
The rest mass energies of an electron and positron is 2 ⋅ 511 keV = 1.022 MeV.
The photon must be near a nucleus in order to satisfy conservation of momentum::: as an electron–positr
on pair produced.

Electron–positr
on pair production in Ferent Quantum Gravity:

“The photon with the energy higher than 1.022 MeV near a nucleus is split in a negative photon and a positive photon. An electron is produced from the negative photon and a positron is produced from the positive photon”
Adrian Ferent

I explained the reverse of this process::: electron–positr
on annihilation.

to all but especially to my daughter Kristina Tran 🧡🤟",That’s partly true. It started because in 1946::: there was a student named Al. He worked in the evenings in the union as a dishwasher. He was always missing class because of working so late. He fell behind and was on the brink of getting thrown out. He pulled an all nighter though and showed up to take his test::: but he had the wrong time and when he got there the final was over. He flunked out::: but he joined the army and rose to the rank of E3 before getting accidentally run over by a tank in the motor pool at Fort Hood. His old boss at the union got a letter from Al’s mom saying what happened and the boss told Al’s old professor in that class that he had failed. A bunch of kids who were on the honors list then decided to light the tower in Al’s honor in 1948 as kind of a joke but not really because they liked having clean dishes. They used flashlights to light the tower. The Texan was about to write a story about Al but the President of the University had them change the story to say it was about honoring high achievers who did well in their classes. It is really honoring Al and others like him.,Connor Saludares,"https://

NEWS.UTEXAS.EDU
This UT Student Startup Is Bringing Estate Planning Into the Digital Age - UT News",2021-04-02 20:15:23,Good job 👌,Good job 👍,Nice,"All physicists::: all scientists::: all Nobel Laureates::: your professors… did not understand that Newton's law of universal gravitation and Newton's third law are wrong!

“Newton's law of universal gravitation and Newton's third law are wrong”
Adrian Ferent

“I discovered that Newton's law of universal gravitation is wrong.
I discovered that Einstein's gravitation theory is wrong”
Adrian Ferent

“Ferent's gravitational force function:”
Adrian Ferent

“The graviton flux is defined as the number of gravitons per second per unit area”
Adrian Ferent

“In Ferent Quantum Gravity Newton's law of universal gravitation and Newton’s third law are wrong”
Adrian Ferent

In the last 300 years students have learned from professors::: from books::: from the greatest scientists…that
Newton's law of universal gravitation and Newton’s third law are right.

Newton's third law: for every action (force) there is an equal and opposite reaction (force).

Newton's law of universal gravitation: every particle attracts every other particle with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers.

If the bodies have volume::: have spatial extent (as opposed to being point masses)::: then the gravitational force is calculated by summing the contributions of the point masses that constitute the bodies.

Newton's law of universal gravitation::: as a vector equation:

By Newton's third law:
F12 = −F21.

“Newton's third law is wrong”
Adrian Ferent

“Newton's law of universal gravitation and Newton's third law are wrong”
Adrian Ferent

1. Newton's law of universal gravitation and Newton’s third law are wrong.
The interaction between a Black hole and a planet or a star:

“The gravitational force exerted by the Black hole on the planet is much higher than the gravitational force exerted by the planet on the Black hole. Because the energy of the gravitons emitted by the Black hole is much higher than the energy of the gravitons emitted by the planet”
Adrian Ferent

This means Newton’s third law is wrong and Newton's law of universal gravitation is wrong:
F12 ≠ −F21

2. Newton's law of universal gravitation and Newton’s third law are wrong.

Because the reaction is not simultaneously:::
because the gravitons which mediate the gravitational force::: have a finite speed::: not an infinite speed.

“Ferent's gravitational force function:”
Adrian Ferent

Where:
F - the force between the masses
G - the gravitational constant
m1 - the first mass;
m2 - the second mass;
r - the distance between the centers of the masses
The Dirac delta function can be rigorously defined either as a distribution or as a measure.

This is another proof that Ferent Quantum Gravity is right.

3. Newton's law of universal gravitation and Newton’s third law are wrong.

“The graviton flux emitted by Earth is bigger than the graviton flux emitted by Moon.”
Adrian Ferent

“The graviton flux is defined as the number of gravitons per second per unit area”
Adrian Ferent

This means more gravitons will arrive and interact from the Earth to the Moon than from the Moon to the Earth.

“The Earth attracts with greater force the Moon::: than the Moon attracts the Earth”
Adrian Ferent

4. Newton's law of universal gravitation and Newton’s third law are right.

Newton's law of universal gravitation and Newton’s third law are right for identical objects::: this means: m1 = m2

“In Ferent Quantum Gravity Newton's law of universal gravitation and Newton’s third law are wrong”
Adrian Ferent

“Newton and Einstein did not understand Gravitation::: they calculated Gravitation”
Adrian Ferent

“Einstein bent the space::: Ferent unbent the space”
Adrian Ferent

“I discovered that Newton's law of universal gravitation is wrong.
I discovered that Einstein's gravitation theory is wrong”
Adrian Ferent

"""The news out of Atlanta is reprehensible::: eliciting fears the victims were targeted for their race or gender. As a university::: we have a responsibility to educate::: and I’m grateful for UT faculty & staff holding a workshop on combatting anti-Asian racism: https://bit.ly/30SoIZ2

No one should live in fear of hatred and violence. In the days and weeks ahead::: I will be having more conversations with Asian American faculty::: staff::: and students about other steps the university can take to support our AAPI community members.""

—President Hartzell",2021-03-18 19:21:50,This type of unfounded::: premature statement actually fuels race problems in our Country. The Police say it was not racially motivated::: so don't make it out to be.,Do you realize that the shooting in Atlanta had nothing to do with race? The guy that did it said that he was targeting sex workers because he was addicted to sex and he wanted to eliminate the temptation. He said they were targets of convenience and he planned on shooting more people in other locations that do the same thing.,Man::: my liberal university automatically goes to race. Guy admitted he was a sex addict who frequents those massage parlors who offer happy endings. Do better!,Funny how everyone saying why do you think this was racially motivated::: this isn't about race is white. I'm sure that's just a coincidence.,Y'all hate the 'r-word' so much y'all really out here defending a mass murderer. Wow 👏,Wow! I’m amazed at the amount of people on here taking a mass murderer’s word to police as the full truth. Almost like sticking up for him. This is just the most current and worst action (that I know of) taken against Asian Americans in the last year. There are many more out there. He specifically picked Asian businesses. That’s a decision based on race.,Why create an issue of race when none exists in this instance::: based on facts and reality? It grossly undermines those instances when race is an actual issue.,"Complete fabrication.
The shooting subject stated to the arresting officer: “ I’m a sex addict”.
In his sick::: insane::: twisted mind; he targeted what he believed to be sex workers.
Therefore media narrative is a lie.",How does anyone know this is racially motivated as opposed to the work of a lunatic::: a family or community squabble::: a random act? We really don’t know. To assume and then immediately get in front of it by congratulating yourself that you aren’t like that sounds terribly inappropriate.,UT has lost its moral compass and replaced it with PC compass. That’s not always the moral or ethical way to go when it’s not based on fact.,Stop spreading lies!! The killer has said this isn’t racially motivated! Bad choice UT! Every mass killing is devastating stop with the pandering!,This is Total BS! Killer admitted it was a sexual crime not racial. The President of the University should not be spreading false narratives!,Thank you::: UT for doing the work::: despite ignorance on this feed. The comments on this post is why we remain in an evil::: racist::: extremist place in our country. Instead of debating the reason::: some of you need to show basic compassion. My heart and prayers goes out to those who knew and loved the victims.🧡,Here we go again..feeding into the media coverage instead of waiting for all the facts. A university of this caliber should have a policy of staying out of the daily media drama and waiting until investigations are complete before spending tax dollars on a “solution.”,"Stick to educating our young Texans. The facts are not all in. Why would you post this?

For several years::: Asians have been attacked in NYC but because they have not been “the correct color perpetrators:::” UT has remained silent.
Violence is violence no matter what color of skin the person has.

President Hartzell::: where were you when Asians were being attacked (and still are in NYC? You::: Sir need to stand against all violence and racism::: no mater who is committing the crime.",So not surprising that all the people rushing to defend a murderer and believe his story all look the same.,Propaganda. The killer stated this isn't racially motivated. We all appreciate the continued conversation you are having with the faculty::: staff and students regarding DEI but please stop blaming everything on racism.,This is false news::: racism is wrong but this was not racially lead. The evidence is clear. Please stop spreading lies.,"This is all I could find from any source: ""Authorities have not yet confirmed a motive for the shootings at three Atlanta-area spas::: which killed eight people -\-\ including six Asian women. A suspect is in custody."" The statement above is 'eliciting' a conclusion that has not been proven. Is the guy a racist? Is he mentally ill? Is he a white supremacist? Is he QAnon? Is he a crazy left-winger? A crazy right-winger? Nobody knows. But I'm sure we will find out.","Is anyone at UT actually moderating this thread? Many of these comments are racist and gaslighting to UT students::: staff::: and faculty.

I assume many of you are either graduates of the university or have children who attend::: and frankly::: I am ashamed and disappointed right now to even go here. The attacks::: based solely on the facts and the identities of the victims of the massacre (of which six were Asian women) were both motivated by anti-Asian violent sentiments::: misogyny::: anti-sex work::: and so::: so::: so::: so much more than y'all are willing to admit or actively choosing to misunderstand. So I have some things to say:

1. Anti-Asian violence is not un-American in the slightest. It is incredibly American. Look at the Chinese Exclusion Act and its aftermath. Look at U.S. foreign policy in the 20th century. Millions of Asians dead. Look at the demonization of South Asians post 9/11. Look at the Anti-China rhetoric many of you spew today.
2. Remember that Asians and Asian Americans are not a monolith and unlearn the model minority myth. Your Asian American activism (which many of you do not even consider in the first place) should center poor::: working class Asian American men::: women::: and non-binary individuals working in dangerous conditions to make ends meet.
3. Many of you are saying this is sexually-motiva
ted::: but you are refusing to understand how this sexual violence::: particularly against Asian sex workers::: is rooted in this country's imperialism in the 20th century.
4. You are all so comfortable in your refusal to see that almost everything in this nation is about race. Wake up. WAKE. UP. WAKE. UP. WAKE. UP.",Look at all these racists outing themselves in this comments section... 🤭,All the chowderheads here laughing and saying race bait...If you believe that this dude killed 8 asian americans because his dick was hard::: Ill pray for yall.,"Literally just commenting this because I am SO overwhelmed with the hate spewing from UT affiliates in this country.

The statement LITERALLY said “eliciting fears that the victims were targeted for their race or gender”. You can get up on your soap boxes and “iTs NOt rAcIsM” all you want. Mr. hartzell probably won’t see your comments — your AAPI friends on Facebook will::: though. And those people ARE scared::: i can assure you.

It is undeniable that this man committed horrific crimes. A racist very rarely sees themself as a racist::: and a sexist sees it even less. His word does not hold any value. How many adult content shops did he drive past on his way from Atlanta to Florida? Or even from one parlor to the next? How many strip clubs? Y’all are SPEEDING to the keyboard to defend this murderer when TO YOUR OWN POINTS::: we don’t have the facts.

I’m not going to applaud UT for doing the bare minimum and issuing this statement::: but I do want to put this out here so that maybe others will not feel as isolated as I have reading through these comments. Hook ‘em::: I guess.",Check the facts so far. This terrible incident may have had nothing to do with targeting a specific race. I listened to at least 2 news press conferences where the ATL PD stated that the perpetrator confessed his crime was brought on by a sex addiction. It is too early to know all the facts.,"Thank you for taking the right stance::: UT. For those questioning if the violence in Atlanta was racism - yes::: it was::: because the perpetrator fetishized the women because of their race.

I’m sure a person who has shot 8 people had every reason to want to deflect the potential Hate Crime charges by minimizing the obvious “coincidence” that his victims were all minorities.
He specifically viewed Asian women as temptation?
I wonder why?
Cryptic.
The examination of how a mass slaughter of a group might be triggering to those already under attack at much higher rates than ever before is the right thing to do and the University honoring the felt safety of its faculty and students is part of an education program that is centered on respect.

"It was exactly one year ago this week that COVID-19 forced The University of Texas to pivot into new teaching and research modalities. Obviously::: we’re not through with the pandemic yet. Nevertheless::: it’s time for us to begin planning our transition to what we hope will be a near normal fall.

As we move forward with fall semester planning::: there is one thing that will absolutely not change: our commitment to public health best practices through collective safety::: responsibility and solidarity. From testing and contact tracing to in-house epidemiological modeling and public health communications::: we’re going to continue to leverage our capabilities and expertise to Protect Texas Together. The same guiding principles that have enabled us to combat COVID-19 while maintaining critical research and teaching functions will absolutely remain in place.

We encourage all members of the Longhorn family to see the report and learn more about the history of the Eyes – and through the song::: to learn more about the history of the university.

Read the report: http://eyesoftexas.utexas.edu/",2021-03-09 14:22:54,"'No racist intent' does not cut it. Unintentional racism is still racism. UT wants to unite the student body? Find another song.
I agree with this opinion: ""It's still embarrassing that a school administration puts so much effort into keeping the song::: which is a relic::: with its primordial origins cooked in the poisonous stew of white supremacy::: minstrel shows and segregation."" ~ Mike Freeman::: USA Today",The tune is still “I’ve Been Working on the Railroad”. That’s a minstrel song. It’s difficult to separate the two::: regardless of the original intent. As a UT alumnus of the Butler School of Music::: I am very disappointed in this decision::: though not surprised.,Rafael Ocana,Well done. My personal thanks to all who served on the Committee. That required countless hours of research and listening to each other with open minds and hearts. Let us read the report and research to educate ourselves fully and move forward together. Hook Em Horns!,"It's time to cancel the ""Cancel Culture"". What a disgrace and waste of time. Good or bad::: citizens must embrace our history and evolve from it into a free and respectful society. History is all about appreciating certain struggles without ""throwing the baby out with the bath water"" and become better men and women from those experiences. Students are flunking the lesson here.","Let’s see: a UT-affiliated commission set up by UT declares a UT racist song not racist. Ok then! Good to know!

Also determined: TX was not one of the original Confederate states; the Civil War was not about slavery; and::: the Earth is flat only in TX!

Anything else for the commission to clear up?",Vaudeville and minstrel shows were vastly popular when UT adopted this theme song::: but much of Vaudeville is now considered racist by today’s cultural norms. Most UT students and alumni never sang this song with racist intent. Rather than erasing this history::: UT should use this as a teachable moment to drive conversations about race: how far we have come and how far we still have to go.,Thank you. Now let's get the band students educated and ready to play this song again and get on with life!,And the college of social sciences exPLODES with condescension and disgust!😂😂😂,I want to applaud UT for the most elegant version of “sorry you took it that way.” 🤬 Nothing reeks more of white privilege than telling black athletes and band members they aren’t being hurt. This won’t age well...and I think this issue is far from over. Over a damn song. 🤦That’s such a small ask to prove you aren’t complicit with racism. SMDH.,Can you imagine being so weak-minded you are offended by everything and expect society to cater to your pathetic way of thinking. Never thought I would see society devolve into such a pile of stupidity. But liberals prove it more and more every single day,"WoW amazing how time flies Matt. Memoirs of those fabulous years early nineties. Times were different. Better at times.

Hook’em Horns ‘92","Diversity comes in all sizes. I was 55 when I first sat in a UT classroom -\-\ an ""older than average"" student who was ignored by nearly all students -\-\ and certainly the ones in social sciences. One student actually told me to my face that I was too old and taking a seat away from someone else. I graduated with a few young friends who made all my classes more fun and interesting because they taught me a lot about themselves and their generation. My professors embraced my age and difference because I showed up::: did my assignments::: and volunteered to go first when no one else would. I am a proud Longhorn graduate with a double major and a healthy GPA and::: if there is anyone on campus who is uncomfortable with tradition::: wants to change UT tradition::: or is not satisfied with their free-ride athletic scholarship::: then go and go now.

and hope everyone will accept them. One question::: will the band be required to play the song???","My History 366N class did a deep dive into the “Eyes of Texas” back in ‘91. Interesting that back then nobody reported any racism - including the two black students in the class.

Woke culture attempts to destroy anything that doesn’t meet its elitist view of the world - nothing but leftist propaganda gone amuck. Too many young minds have been infected by this nonsense. Can we get a woke deprogramming class at UT?",So bottom line.....If Herman would have used some sense instead of trying to use his wokeness to try to pander to recruits during the racial tension of the Summer::: and just informed the players of the facts and the fact that the song is not racist::: all of this BS could have been avoided.,"STOP SAYING ""EQUITY"".

UT Austin Is Once Again Named Among the World’s Leading Universities - UT News",2021-03-08 15:51:50,The President of the University should do the right thing and publicly stand up for the Eyes of Texas Today. He has allowed these lies to go on for many months when a five minute speech could clear the name of the University of Texas and of the Eyes of Texas. Nothing racist about the song now or ever. It is actually a positive message of faith and hope. The President of the University at the time was fond of telling students that the Eyes of Texas are upon you meaning the Eyes of all Texans are upon current UT students because we expect great things from them. We know that they will go out and change the world. There is literally decades and decades of video of fans::: players::: students and alumni of all races standing shoulder to shoulder with their Horns raised as one family singing with shared pride in this great University. Hartzell stand up now and clear the name of the Eyes of Texas once and for all by simply telling the truth.

"Dear UT Community:::

With Spring Break on the horizon::: the increased availability of vaccines and recent public discussions about policy choices::: I’ve been hearing many questions about how we plan to finish this school year in terms of our safety and wellness protocols. Let me address those questions directly — we have been safely delivering on our teaching and research missions so far this year::: and our protocols have been working. As a result::: those policies — including requiring masks in our buildings::: classrooms and labs — will remain in place. This is in accordance with the most recent guidance from the Texas Education Agency.

Darrell Royal was once asked about changing his offense in response to a couple of rough games. He replied::: “There’s an old saying. ‘You dance with the one that brung ya.’” In spite of difficult circumstances::: we’ve had a good year — and we are going to dance with what brought us: Protecting Texas Together. Why? Because it’s these policies and choices that have enabled us to continue discovering and disseminating knowledge.

Thank you for all you’ve done to get us to this point. We are nearing the one-year anniversary of COVID-19 entering our community. Recently::: I’ve been part of many conversations that started with something like::: “Where were you when COVID hit Austin?” I vividly recall flying back from a family trip and receiving a phone call while in the Newark airport that essentially meant I wasn’t going back to the office the next day. And::: here we are now together::: almost a year later. We’ve had many trials and tribulations during the past 12 months::: but I am really proud of how our campus has rallied.

Hang in there::: and Hook ’em::: Horns!

Jay Hartzell

So the University of Texas is::: supposed to be::: a prestigious university. Supposed to be. My sister is an alumni::: as is my wife’s son and a couple of my cousins.
Now keeping that in mind::: if you happen to carry a degree earned at that university::: then hold your self to a higher standard. Why?? Because the “Eyes of Texas” are upon you. Set the example::: carry yourself with a little more self esteem and little more compassion and humility. But be proud you earned what ever level of degree you earned. Why?? The Eyes of Texas are upon you. Set the example of how people should conduct business::: handle customer service::: treat people. Why?? The Eyes of Texas are upon you. When your athletes are on the field show good sportsmanship and carry yourselves with dignity! Why? The Eyes of Texas::: and the world are upon you!
That is what I take away from those lyrics when I read them. The more famous you are after graduating from the University of Texas::: the more The Eyes of Texas and the rest of the world are upon you every night and every day.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Longhorn Nation has already raised over $80:::000 for UT students impacted by the winter storm.

There's just one week left to give to the Orange & Maroon Texas Tough fundraiser and help UT raise the most for Texas students in need: https://utex.as/383whjp",2021-03-03 19:38:57,I'd love to see all those folks who threatened to withhold their support for athletics spread the love. . . if they can have fits about a song::: maybe they can be real change and help students through this support.,Richardson city provides electricity to their residents living in condos and the fee is outrageous.,Texas like all other white colleges and their GOP status don't gibe a crap about Black players and students. This is beyond being face slapped. Where the hell are the balls on the UT administration to stand up to the Boosters? As long as your Black slaves entertain and obey their master it's all fine at UT. Don't let the players have a voice or rights. Texas is racist as they come. Bunch of bible hugging hypocrites:::,If you want to help Texans affected by the weather::: we need to make sure that Texas utilities are regulated. Right now we are unregulated here in Tx and people died because of that.,"Will they base donations to help students based on their position on the ""Eyes of Texas ""?","On the issue of the electricity crisis in Texas...

Texas can rise from this situation better and stronger. Jobs will be created as power grids and power generation plants are rebuilt::: and people can file for Patents as new equipment is invented and people can do manufacturing of new and improved equipment::: etc::: and there will be jobs for the people who are putting the power lines safely underground::: etc.

And new power companies can be created which are owned by the cities::: like we do in Anaheim::: so people can have cheap electrcity::: plus some of the money can go into a General Fund to be spent by the people however they want::: and some of the money can go to help the homeless people::: etc::: like we do in Anaheim.

Texans can help to invent the new equipment of the future when it comes to power generation and power grids::: and jobs will be created for Texans as they rebuild and as they invent::: and the new power companies can be owned by the people and some of the money can go into a General Fund to be spent however the people want to spend it.

And Texas can go Green with all of it::: and Texans can lead and profit from the goal of creating cleaner energy around our planet.

This whole crisis in Texas can be a blessing in disguise as Texas rebuilds and invents and as the people take control of their power companies.

Texas can rise to be better and stronger.

But as a public university they may not have a choice 😓,You might restate that as I have a grand son who applied there...,How many versions of compliance can there be::: you either follow it or you don’t....it’s pretty simple...but asking any students to sign and documents for any “new” school policies you adapt that may go against the executive order::: I hope u sued for,"My understanding of this “order” is that individual businesses..I.e
. restaurants::: stores::: etc. can still require masks if they want. Individual responsibility.
..",If you want to wear a mask::: wear a mask if you don't want to wear a mask don't wear a mask. It's quite simple let every person decide their own level of risk they want to take.

Light the Tower: Texas Independence Day",2021-03-02 23:45:22,The University of Texas at Austin It seems like it would be worth noting that Texas Independence was motivated by protecting slavery. I'm a lifelong Texan and current graduate student and don't want to celebrate a holiday that is rooted in the exploitation of Black people. Shame on you for making this ahistorical post and promoting this racist holiday.,When I was in school from 1979 to 1983::: we used to have a big celebration on the south mall with the flag::: bevo::: the tower and cheer and a huge cake and it was a blast. It is inexcusable that the Texas Exes no longer sponsor this event on campus. Making traditions like these is what inspires students to be a part of the Longhorn family for life and join the Texas Exes.,To all the haters::: well bye. Go back to the tamu page.,Yeah::: not exactly proud of Texas today.,Tyler Lindsey,🤘🏽♥️🤘🏽,Bonnie Black,🤘,"Happy Birthday Texas!!!

This is out of control. If you cave to this bizarre complaint::: everthing and nothing is racist anymore and you::: stand for Marxism/
totalitarianism.
For a University::: you lack education about what is really going on. Don't fool yourselves::: you are being manipulated like a fiddle.

People aren’t “targeting UT students with hateful views” and I seriously doubt that your sentiments represent the values of the greater Longhorn community.

You’re a pandering fool::: but if sincere you’re also an unwitting pawn in a game over which you have no control. You may believe you’re defending your student body::: when in fact you are condemning them to the very injustices for which they feign complaints.

Not only is the premise of rampant racism in America absurd it is also injurious to civil society.

This situation is incredibly unideal::: I get it. People are doing the BEST that they can given this situation; I’m talking students::: administration:::
volunteers::: parents::: etc. It’s not just Austin::: it’s the entire state. It does nothing to victimize your kids when even you are in the same boat. If you don’t think the university is doing enough::: donate to the Austin mutual aid to get kids and other family’s food::: water::: and other resources. Trucks cannot come with supplies because how can they get through the snow and ice if we can’t? The community has pulled together in remarkable ways. The only thing we can do at this point is wait for things to sort themselves out and help those who need it. Again::: everyone is doing the best they can. Students are adults::: and we can handle this situation.",This is very unacceptable. A college student should not be living in a dorm without water or bathroom facility. And now the threat of the cafeteria running out of food! Aren’t there any hotels in Austin? We’re making boxes of food available to those who have lost jobs::: what about boxes of food to college students. I am amazed that Texas would let this happen in their university!

We will notify you when the state permits UT to open up vaccine to students::: faculty::: and staff beyond 1B. Until then::: only those who meet the 1B criteria::: have filled out the registration form::: and received a personalized email with a scheduling link can make an appointment.
Link to the registration form: https://redcap.dellmed.utexas.edu/surveys/?s=FNJMNYKH4N

Members of the general public::: including retirees::: emeritus faculty::: family members and dependents of members of the UT community::: and healthcare workers who meet the state’s criteria for approved phases for vaccination allocation may request a COVID-19 vaccine from UT Health Austin here: https://uthealthaustin.org/patient-resources/covid-19-updates/covid-19-vaccination",2021-02-09 19:47:34,Addison,Nathan Munoz Ethan Munoz,"(B.A. Bible/Biology)

WHILE WAITING FOR a proper vaccine::: make sure that you have adequate levels of Vitamins B::: C::: D and the mineral zinc. These nutrients greatly support the immune system and can help prevent an illness from Covid from becoming serious and even prevent death from the Covid-19 virus::: as well as OTHER viruses. Do some research::: please.

Even when you get a vaccine::: it’s your immune system that must fight the virus. A proper vaccine jump-starts your immune system in detecting and fighting the virus. A vaccine gives your immune system a head-start to battle the virus.

Interestingly::: they have found that zinc slows down the activity of the virus and this enables your body's immune system to catch-up in fighting the virus.

It takes only pennies a day of supplements to prevent terrible and easily avoidable tragedy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

JUST BECAUSE SCIENCE CAN EXPLAIN how an airplane works doesn't mean that no one designed or made the airplane. And just because science can explain how life or the universe works doesn't mean there was no Designer and Maker behind them.

Natural laws may explain how the order in the universe works and operates::: but mere undirected natural laws cannot explain the origin of that order. Once you have a complete and living cell then the genetic code and biological machinery exist to direct the formation of more cells from raw materials such as amino acids and other chemicals::: but how could life or the cell have naturally originated when no directing code and mechanisms existed in nature? Read my Internet article: HOW FORENSIC SCIENCE REFUTES ATHEISM.

WHAT IS SCIENCE? Science simply is knowledge based on observation. No human observed the universe coming by chance or by design::: by creation or by evolution. These are positions of faith. The issue is which faith the scientific evidence best supports.

SCIENCE SHOWS THAT THE UNIVERSE CANNOT BE ETERNAL because it could not have sustained itself eternally due to the law of entropy (increasing and irreversible net energy decay::: even in an open system). Even a hypothetical oscillating universe could not continue to oscillate eternally! Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity shows that space::: matter::: and time all are physical and all had a beginning. Space even produces particles because it’s actually something::: not nothing. What about the Higgs boson (the so-called “God Particle”)? The Higgs boson::: even if it existed::: would not have created mass from nothing::: but rather it would have converted energy into mass. Einstein showed that all matter is some form of energy. Even time had a beginning! Time is not eternal.

The law of entropy doesn't allow the universe to be eternal. If the universe were eternal::: everything::: including time (which modern science has shown is as physical as mass and space)::: would have become totally entropied by now and the entire universe would have ended in a uniform heat death a long::: long time ago. The fact that this hasn't happened already is powerful evidence for a beginning to the universe.

Popular atheistic scientist Stephen Hawking admits that the universe had a beginning and came from nothing but he believes that nothing became something by a natural process yet to be discovered. That's not rational thinking at all::: and it also would be making the effect greater than its cause to say that nothing created something. The beginning had to be of supernatural origin because science teaches us from the First Law of Thermodynamics that natural laws and processes do not have the ability to bring something into existence from nothing.

The supernatural origin of the universe cannot be proved by science but science points to a supernatural intelligence and power for the origin and order of the universe. Where did God come from? Obviously::: unlike the universe::: God’s nature doesn’t require a beginning.

The disorder in the universe can be explained because of chance and random processes::: but the order can be explained only because of intelligence and design.

Gravity may explain how the order found in the precise and orderly courses of thousands of billions of stars is maintained::: but gravity cannot explain the origin of that order.

Some evolutionary astronomers believe that trillions of stars crashed into each other leaving surviving stars to find precise orderly orbits in space. Not only is this irrational::: but if there was such a mass collision of stars then there would be a super mass residue of gas clouds in space to support this hypothesis. The present level of residue of gas clouds in space doesn't support the magnitude of star deaths required for such a hypothesis. And::: as already stated::: the origin of stars cannot be explained by the Big Bang because of the reasons mentioned above. It’s one thing to say that stars may decay and die into random gas clouds::: but it is totally different to say that gas clouds form into stars.

Even the father of Chaos theory admitted that the ""mechanisms"" existing in the non-living world allow for only very rudimentary levels of order to arise spontaneously (by chance)::: but not the kind or level of order we find in the structures of DNA::: RNA::: and proteins. Yes::: individual amino acids have been shown to come into existence by chance but not protein molecules which require that the various amino acids be in a precise sequence just like the letters found in a sentence.

Some things don’t need experiment or scientific proof. In law there is a dictum called prima facie evidence. It means “evidence that speaks for itself.”

An example of a true prima facie would be if you discovered an elaborate sand castle on the beach. You don’t have to experiment to know that it came by design and not by the chance forces of wind and water.

If you discovered a romantic letter or message written in the sand::: you don’t have to experiment to know that it was by design and not because a stick randomly carried by wind put it there. You naturally assume that an intelligent and rational being was responsible.

It's interesting that Carl Sagan would have acknowledged sequential radio signals in space as evidence of intelligent life sending them::: but he wouldn't acknowledge the sequential structure of molecules in DNA (the genetic code) as evidence of an intelligent Cause. Read my popular Internet article::: HOW DID MY DNA MAKE ME.

ADAM AND EVE: HUMANITY’S FIRST MUTTS

PEOPLE OFTEN ASK how all the different races could have descended from Adam and Eve. But::: in principle this is no different than asking how children with different color hair can come from the same parents who both have black hair. Just as some couples today carry the genes to produce children with different color hair::: so too Adam and Eve::: our first parents::: carried the genes to produce all the varieties and ""races"" of people. You and I today may not possess the genes for producing various races::: but Adam and Eve did possess such genes. Everyone knows that you can get a pure breed from a mutt::: but you can't get a mutt from a pure breed. A mutt carries genes to produce pure races. Adam and Eve::: our first parents::: were mutts!

Some years ago a photo of the First Lady::: Michelle Obama::: was doctored up on an Internet site ""Hot Girls"" so that she appeared to have ape-like features. This is a horrible and offensive photo. We need to have a conversation on this topic now. Not long ago a team of psychologists from Stanford::: Penn State::: and UC Berkeley have reported that blacks are likely to be thought of by other races as being sub-human and associated with apes. Let's admit it! Many people::: even blacks themselves::: wonder whether black people are more closely related to apes because of certain facial features or other similarities. This issue needs to be dealt with in the open and honestly.

Well::: let me ask this question. Are bull dogs more closely related to cats because they have flat faces and short legs? Obviously not! A bull dog can be crossed with other dogs but not a cat! Neither are blacks more closely related to apes! There are monkeys which have some very fine features and skin complexion resembling those of white people (Do an ""Image"" search for ""Snow Monkeys"" on Google and see for yourself). Does that mean that whites are more closely related to a Snow Monkey? Of course not!

Ultimately::: all life forms on earth share varying similarities because of a common Designer who designed similar functions for similar purposes in all of the various species and life forms on Earth.

All varieties of humans belong to one natural species since all varieties of human beings are inter-fertile::: and this is biological proof that we are all descendants of a common human ancestor. This is why the Bible says that God ""hath made of one all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth ..."" (Acts 17:26::: KJV). The Bible clearly teaches that God created all human beings in His image. Therefore::: as one of my former pastors::: Dr. Carl E. Abrahamsen::: Jr.::: so truthfully and eloquently stated::: to hate a fellow human being who has been created in the image of God because of the way he or she looks is a great and serious sin and offense against God which needs to be confessed and repented of immediately before the Almighty.

Many believe that the Bible teaches the so-called ""Curse of Ham"" and that the black race has been cursed. This is not true. Such teaching is a major misinterpretati
on of the Scriptures and was wrongly used to justify slavery.

The name “Ham” in the Bible means “black:::” or “burnt.” Ham::: who was one of the three sons of Noah::: was black. Ham was named “black one” by his father Noah from birth. In other words::: black skin was not a curse because Ham was born black::: long before Noah placed any curse. In fact::: contrary to popular belief there was never a “Curse of Ham” because it wasn’t Ham who was cursed. The curse for Ham’s sin against Noah fell on Ham’s son Canaan and not on Ham himself. Canaan was one of the four sons of Ham. Ham also had other sons::: but they were not cursed. Noah foresaw that Canaan would follow in the immoral steps and behavior of his father Ham and::: as a consequence::: Noah declared Canaan to be cursed. The curse was ultimately fulfilled in the total destruction of the Canaanites (Phoenicians) as a nation by the Roman Empire.

Nowhere in the Bible does it teach that black skin is a curse from God. Black skin protects from the harmful effects of ultraviolet light from the Sun. In fact::: all human skin color is really brown. The pigment that gives skin its color is melanin and melanin is brown. Whites have the least amount of melanin in their skin and that’s why they appear to be “white.” Only albinos (those born with no melanin because of a genetic defect and mutation) are pure white and are in most danger from the harmful effects of the Sun’s rays. Instead of black skin being a curse it is a healthful blessing for those living in year round hot climates.

This article was written to make a point to all those who harbor racism. I hope that you will repent of your sin of racism::: which is a great sin against God Who created all men in His image and has commanded all men to love one another::: and that you will receive the love and forgiveness of God which is in Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior Who paid the penalty for all our sins through His death and shedding of His blood on the Cross of Calvary and Who rose again from the dead to give us eternal life.

You see::: just as a co-signer to a bad loan takes the full legal blame and liability to pay the entire debt on the loan so::: too::: Jesus Christ::: God's eternal and only begotten Son::: took upon Himself the full legal and moral liability to pay the entire debt for our sins.

The Bible says that Jesus Christ lived a sinless life on earth and that on the Cross He bore our sins in His own body and received the punishment from God (the Father) that we deserve for our sins and then He rose again from the dead. The Bible teaches that the penalty for even one sin is so great that we could never completely pay the penalty. Only God Himself is capable of fully paying for our sins and Jesus Christ Who is God (the Son) did just that on the Cross of Calvary. It was for us that Christ suffered and died on the Cross! Christ took it upon Himself to pay our debt. Because Christ took the blame and punishment for our sins::: God (the Father) can be just in freely forgiving us of our sins when we genuinely repent and put our faith and trust in Jesus Christ alone to save us.

Welcome to the Forty Acres::: Coach Steve Sarkisian! 🤘

https://hookem.at/CoachSarkisian",2021-01-02 21:52:41,I’ve seen far better coaching resumes than this latest offensive genius brings::: as in Win-Loss record.,Well::: here we go again. Now they will add another cost to our tickets to pay off coaches. We used to get parking with our tickets::: then we had to pay $100 extra. I hope we don't hear of another increase to cover their misjudgments. Just hoping this new coach makes a difference.,Really bad hire and really be lucky to even have winning season next year and sorry as UT fan they laugh stick of college football,Recruiting was in the tank::: former and current players weren't fans of Herman. A change needed to be made plain and simple. He had four years::: a senior QB and still can't beat OU on a down year for them. If Sark can bring in a great staff or retain a few of the good ones we have::: things will be good.🤘,Funniest one I’ve heard so far. “Firing Tom Herman to hire Steve Sarkisian is like driving past a Chili’s and pulling into the parking lot at Applebee’s”,No honor in this move after giving your word to Herman. Glad I gave up my season tickets after 20 plus years.,The key is his coordinator. If he brings in solid teachers and guys who develop talent::: the wins will come. I guarantee he absorbed some solid teaching from Saban and will implement the same approach in Austin.,What a joke. This guy barely had a .500 record as a head coach.... and they expect him to solve the issue.,Amazing. Everyone wants him fired when they lose the big games::: but when he does get fired::: they complain about that.,Don’t unpack::: Steve. Unless you win a championship next season!,Let’s give it a chance. I have a good overal feeling about it.,This is a bad::: bad hire. Time to replace Del Conte.,I'm so so so sick over this!! What in the hell were you boosters thinking??!?? We need a Championship not another news story!!,Would not have posed in masks. Just sayin......🤘,Well at least this one::: unlike the last 2::: gets to start with a ton of talent.,I’m a Falcons fan and he’s the worst offense coordinator I’ve seen. He just has so much talent at Alabama::: he can accidentally be good. What a terrible move.,He better not bother unpacking he won't be here long.,Y’all just side stepped. Sarkisian is not the answer. Maybe getting rid of the ppl making decisions would be a good choice since y’all hired Herman. Maybe it’s you who are incompetent,“We are rebuilding!” The consistent motto of UT.,Solid 4 years and He will be gone what a joke,I'd rather seen Art Briles::: he's available,Bring back MACK!!!,I miss Deloss Dodds. We're supposed to build people up and encourage them. Not fire folks all the time. I do miss Clyde a bunch as well. Edit* I miss Bubba too! He helped out so many folks! Why not ever mention Bubba?,Can't wait to buy him a beer.,"From Michigan podcast ...

Herman beat his biggest rival::: made it to a conference championship game::: won a major bowl game::: and finished as a top 25 team this season. Yet he's fired after 4 seasons.

Harbaugh has done none of those things::: and we're debating a SEVENTH SEASON.
...........
Given that::: with the “success” Sarkisian had at So. Cal::: I guess the Longhorns are now going to soar!?",Yeah he did so well at USC can’t wait for more of the same.,That's like breaking up with someone and having a new SO the next day.... Bad form::: UT::: bad form,From Twitter it seems like some of kids on the team want their position coaches and the current OCs to keep their jobs. Maybe Sark will keep the current assistant coaches in place.,Let’s not forget Mack Brown’s record for the first EIGHT seasons of his head coaching career was 35-53. He had three seasons that were 1-10 and only two winning seasons in 8 years. Mack was great at UT. But he wasn’t a great coach at Tulane and in his first 4 years at UNC.,I think people forget it’s not only the head coach replacement. But an entire staff that was just replaced. 2 staffs in 2 years. New philosophy. No playbooks. The kids are the ones paying the price for impatient rich donors wanting to win in less than 4 years.,Welcome Coach! Be sure to show our players “where the line is”!,As always::: UT cares more about football than academics.,Alabama plays Ohio in a week. This couldn’t have waited until after that game? Regardless of whether this is good for Texas::: I have to think doing this one week before Alabama plays for a national title just makes the whole deal stink::: and makes Texas look like a backstabbing weasel organization. And what kind of coach would leave his team and players one week prior to a national championship game?,F'ing Pete Carroll wannabe. Won't have to bother with season tickets for the next four years. Remeber when they wanted to fire Tom after the first year. Don't bother to unpack.,Sarkisian was surrounded with 5 stars at Alabama. If he doesn’t hire assistants that can recruit Texas talent::: he won’t last 3 years!,Wish we wouldn’t have gotten rid of Tom.,Do you realize he went to Bama in 2019. So where did he get all this great experience? I hope this is a great pick::: but I am not feeling it. Bama will make anybody look good with the recruiting they get.,Don't let him try one of the frozen margaritas at Taco Flats.,As a Sooner fan::: I love that they hired a bad coach::: whose is worse than Herman! #backtoback,Give it another 4 years & the cycle will continue. Any supporters of this move should Google the definition of insanity.,Shouldn't have fired Herman. Sarkisian is another coach that continues to fail up and I doubt he can beat Oklahoma anytime soon.,42-35 as a head coach including 3 straight 7-6 finishes. He meets the criteria. But maybe he learned how to coach calling plays for all those 5 star athletes in Alabama. Looking forward to seeing who the hire in 2023.,Can we at least get discounted tickets???,So give up on another & bring in from SEC.,"I do have to admit::: this ""controversial""
hire is different from the rest!",A waste of time. Another Mackovic hire. He’s not southern enough. The regents will tire of that quickly. You’ll see. Ah well::: it’s there $$$.,Maybe we need to find someone who can hire a decent coach!!,This is absolutely the worst head coaching hire since Mack brown left.,Who is responsible for hiring these overrated coaches?? What a waste of another 4 years.,Sponsored by Austin's own Tito's Vodka. Vodka for Alumni Events. When mingling with donors::: choose Tito's!,Didn’t take long::: did it?,Who is the lady in the picture?,So dumb. Let's hire a guy who sucked at usc and got fired for misconduct.,Hey::: is there anyone in a first year math class? I want some assignments so that I can publish a video of me solving all the problems. Please send the problems to The Math Wig(on Facebook and YouTube.),Let's hope Sarkisian is a real coach who knows how to control his players and win games... Haven't had that in quite a while...,Sarkisian the new $15 million dollar man... Hope you do well or you'll be outta here with a nice fat check!,EVERYONE in this picture is a fing joke!!!! Especially the fool on the far left hand side and the one in the blue shirt ( no horns up ),I'll drink to this,Chris Del Cunty is a clown.,Not feeling it......BAD move !!!!!!!!,Bring mac back,Lane Kiffin 2.0,He’ll probably show up drunk lol,Let's get to recruiting Steve! 🤘🏽,Wanna put bets on how long he lasts! Lol,Isn't he a alcoholic.....,Why him?,Damn. Herman did not enough have enough time to get out of parking lot lol,awful hire....get ready for another era of mediocrity,"Are you willing to become a member of this great Society??

"Statement from The University of Texas at Austin:

With our football season coming to a close::: our vice president and athletics director::: Chris Del Conte::: has evaluated the UT program’s strengths and weaknesses and where the program is relative to our goals. While we have made measured progress during the past several years under Tom Herman’s leadership::: Chris has recommended to the university president::: Jay Hartzell::: that UT make a coaching change to get us on track to achieving our ambitious goals. President Hartzell and the chair of our Board of Regents::: Kevin Eltife::: concur with this recommendation and have approved the change. We thank Coach Herman for his service and dedication to our student-athletes::: our program and our university.",2021-01-02 16:40:09,Changes to a program is a multi-year process. They don't happen overnight and it's unrealistic to think a new coach will come in and make UT a top 5 program in just one or two years. Yet the leadership and fans keep expecting that::: hence we're in a cycle of replacing coaches every few years. At some point::: the best coaches in the country are going to give a hard pass on UT because of this. Find a coach::: let him (or her) build the program::: support them and only then will we see the program go where we want it to.,Well::: poor Tom is leaving with about $18:::000:::000 thanks so he’ll be ok. All who had anything to do with his most recent contract should see the door::: too. And while cleaning house let’s bid farewell to the band director. The Eyes of Texas ARE Upon you!,"Meeting your ambitious goals takes time. It doesn’t happen overnight no matter who the coach is. Impatience breeds mediocrity. And wasn’t it just a few weeks ago that Del Conte said Herman would remain the coach? He sounds kind of wishy washy. Maybe we need a new AD?

https://
amp.usatoday.com
/amp/6523320002",So sad. Herman did a great job::: especially in this crazy year. UT needs to stop firing coaches after just a few years. Coaches don’t build powerhouse teams in just 3-4 years. Winning bowl games each year and winning records should count for something. Even the university admits there was measured progress. The talent seen in the Alamo Bowl is just a hint if what's to come and Herman was a huge part of that. Thank you Coach Herman for your passionate leadership. Your impact will still be here.,Mistake to me but he’s going to be paid well. Good luck to the alumni’s choice for a new one. Thanks Coach Herman ! Enjoy your pay out::: You deserve it.,Sadly::: UT has settled into the traps of a mid-tier program::: changing coaches every 3 to 4 years::: hoping for quick miracles. This is just the next chapter. Way too many boosters getting involved too. They need to get out of the way.,I’m very disappointed that you did this after telling Tom Herman he had another year to coach at Texas. You have no honor.,Wow how about y’all give coaches time to change a program you guys literally are running through coaches every few years. Herman is a great coach,He doesn’t have a chance either. Herman had a good record and making progress::: but our Alumni just can’t sit back and let a coach work. He is gone in 3 or 4 years too.,Jay Hartzell::: what does he know? Del Conte should follow Herman. Tom Herman can go to Alabama and do the same thing that Sark has done. His two coordinators are as good as Sark. In two years when Texas gets rolled by the tide and still finish second in the Big 12 with Sark::: people will be calling for him to go. Texas won't get all the best players in Texas. They never have. Should have try to steal Lane Kiffin from Mississippi. He is better than Sark. Sark's coaching resume isn't even what Herman's is. I thought Texas was the greatest job ever?😄 Herman take the money and run. He can get another job easily.,If what I’m hearing is true::: you are considering an average coach to replace our above average coach who was moving the program in the right direction. You also allowed our AD to give Tom H a vote of confidence just weeks ago? Pretty much a classless act that explains why I no longer contribute or have season tickets! Our University has become a money hungry machine with little regard for integrity::: honor or loyalty. Win at all costs or be damned! Pathetic!,But I thought our issues were because of lack of interest students have in The Eyes of Texas 😆 🤘🏻,four years until we're a contender again::: thanks alot board of Regents. Another example of the cancel/whine 'til you get your way society we find ourselves in.,Sorry to hear that. How are you going to build a winning program when you change coaches every three years.,Now maybe this will help with recruiting. Maybe we can get some players from out of state like the SEC. tired of seeing players from Lake Travis and Westlake and other schools in the area that don’t produce players that are of the college level and are just mediocre and are just not what you need to win at this level.,This is such a stupid move. Which coach is the magic coach of the year to go after? Yall going to pay 8 million a year to a new coach just to get them to move to Texas! This is just bad management from the top of UT.,Sark was 34-29 at Washington and 12-6 at USC. We're going to piss away $24.6 million to fire Herman and his staff just so we can hire a guy with the same record who also got fired for bad behavior? I think we ought to examine CDC and Hartzell's contracts.,So who are we getting? Who's on the list? You dont quit a job until you have a better one. You don't fire a coach until you have a better one. So who's the guy we got coming in? I hated his decisions this year::: but liked what I saw at the future of the QB position and what our new coordinators could do. Who's the new coach CDC?! it has to be a guy that can stand up to billionaire boosters and unrealistic fanbases. Saban still ain't coming.,"I too have been sad that Hermann hasn't done better. But::: I see UT going down the same path as ""the other UT"" where I live now-\-\ a series of coaching changes every 3-4 years due to impatience.::: along with many::: many years of mediocrity. Tennessee fired a national champion winning coach after a few weak seasons and they've sucked worse ever since::: with 6 coaches since 2009. Give a coach at least 5 years!",Tom had ample time to elevate Texas. He couldn't even get them to be the 2nd best program in the Big 12 in 4 years. A good coach and staff should be able to reach that milestone in this conference and at least stay there by the end of year 2. The program was trending the wrong direction the last two years. Good decision let's hope the new coach can hire a better staff and can put them in position to challenge OU every year,Wow! I wonder if this is how they told him. He wasn’t strong enough as a leader. He wanted to be one of the guys and hang with them. Not enough respect and the players acted like they were entitled. Put the cell phones and music crap away while practicing and playing games.,"TX is the most profitable school. We can afford it. Plus what UT fans want to watch 3 more years of mediocre football.

Sark was assistant coach of the year in 2020 under Saban who’s offense scored more points a game in their school history than any other year. Hopefully he can pull some recruits and we can get back to being competitive again.

Bye Herman!",No great players want to play for UT because you've gone too liberal and not in a good conference of teams. Too focused on money.,"LMAO! What a joke! CDC better hope and pray that his HC hire wins the B12 and advances to CFP in year 2 or CDC will be on his way out.

32-18::: 4-0 with Sugar Bowl win in 4 seasons - Thank you Coach Herman for taking a program that went 24-26 and turning it around. It’s a damn shame your not gonna get the chance to finish the job.

CDC & Hartzell bleeding money from donors right now because they failed to handle the Eyes of Texas situation.

Pretty sad state of affairs at university leadership level!",He’s had enough time to show that his recruits and football players are growing::: he has not done that.,Great. We have to start over again. These fools better have a viable candidate otherwise next couple of years will be the same.,They were undefeated in bowl games under Herman..Tcu owned him though::: I think he boosters have too much power at UT::: Strong did not get a fair shake in my opinion from day 1::: under Herman we were good but not great::: but great takes time::: you don't become a Clemson or Alabama over night,If you can fire a guy who just won 70% of his games and is 4-0 in bowls and will have pay 25million to him & assistant coaches::: you don’t need to call me for a donation.,4 winning seasons::: 4 bowl game victories::: 3 losses by 13 points total and you waste $25 mil to pay him and his staff off and you replace him with Sarkisian? What a colossal waste.,"I’m still disappointed that the University caved to a group of boosters who wanted to replace Mack and clearly didn’t know a damn thing about what was best for the University and the program.

Should have kept him.","It doesn’t happen overnight. 5-6 years at a minimum.
No matter what we wish.",Such a stupid move. Kinda hard to become relevant when you fire the coach every other year.,Herman was OK but not great. Those numbers would have been acceptable in a mid level program but not one with national recruiting potential.,How about we get rid of Del Conte?,Why do I give to a university that throws away money paying out a contract to a fired head coach? I will make sure that any monies I gift are directed ONLY to the College of Pharmacy::: you can be sure.,They don't give you anytime to build a program,Way past time to quit crying over a 100 year song and play football.,We'll never have a championship quality team if you let the alumni donors keep driving this revolving door. Building a program takes time::: and no quality coach will want to work at UT anyway as long as this keeps up.,A full academic year spent in broken remote learning and this is what resources are spent on.,So we fire herman and hire Sarkisian? Jesus christ the guy was a disaster at USC. Literally any o Coordinator would have success with the talent Alabama has. I've completely lost faith in the university to make sound football decisions. Is jerry running the university of texas football program behind the scenes::: too?,Such a bad move imo. It’s not the coach::: it’s the university. You can throw all the money around you want::: but you can’t buy a winning culture and pride.,Next year will be the first year with all his own recruits. Now Sarkisian? 🙄🙄,Stop firing good coaches because there’s a bad season! 🙄,New coach anti changing anything at UT to many people think coaches going to change anything,Now to address the band...,How about a quarterback that can throw?,After he beats the Aggies tonight::: bring back Mack!,This is going to be incredibly expensive between the buy out and how much they are going to spend on a replacement.,Merry Christmas 🎁 Just have McConaughey take over. You may not win::: but at least we’ll all enjoy watching! 🤩,Still have Mack's number?,If they don't already have someone signed on the dotted line to take over::: and I don't believe they do::: this may have been one of the stupidest moves in college football. Do we want to be another Nebraska? If there isn't a successor already in place::: perhaps Del Conte should go out the same door. I wasn't a Herman fan::: but it TAKES TIME to build your own program.,Very disappointed in this decision and definitely not a fan of the new hire if it is true.,Blah blah blah. Athletes need to perform like University of Texas was their dream. Get a fire back.,Coaches need to be given time to develop teams. The powers that be aren’t allowing it:::,I’m not surprised at the result::: but the manner in which the information was handled during the season and the multiple reports/leaks coming out from staff::: students::: and boosters undercutting Herman is toxic. That needs to get solved.,and now we lose Bijan along with other recruits::: Sam definitely won’t come back and now a losing record and being the laughing stock of college football. STUPID move!!!!,That's great and all::: but do you really think bringing in Sarkisian is going to improve us? He struggled at USC::: a similar program in history::: tradition::: and resources. I'm looking forward to hopefully taking it to the next level::: but have reservations about who can get that done for us.,Plenty of coaches have built winning programs in 2-3 years: Nick Saban at AL::: Lincoln Riley at OU::: Jimbo Fisher at TAMU and Mack Brown has revitalized North Carolina despite having grown stale at UT. I think this is a great move,I still think Herman was way better than Strong.. damn. Best of luck to to him.,"Can we talk about how UT Athletics has LAID OFF EMPLOYEES this year. Meanwhile::: they have $25 million to pay out guaranteed contracts?

But UT cares::: here’s a pizza party to make up for it. 🍕",Why don’t you get rid of football and concentrate resources on education? You’re a university. You spend tax payers’ dollars::: millions of them::: for something that has nothing to do with your mission.,15mm paid to head coach alone for walking away. Unbelievable.,Sarkisian will be out in another 4 years,Maybe they need to look for better players....,BREAKING NEWS: Steve Sarkesian is expected to have his previous coordinators from USC::: Jack Daniels and Evan Williams accompanying him to Texas. They were responsible for most of his success at USC and will definitely play a big part of his new coaching regime.,Not thrilled about having this revolving door coaching situation with huge buyouts every three or four years now. Tom Herman wasn’t perfect but this decision reeks of desperation and entitlement! Replacing Herman with a coach who was fired under disgrace at USC and zero ties to UT or the state of Texas seems terrible. I predict the same loudmouths wanting Herman fired will want the new guy fired also very soon!!,just another OVERATED school that thinks they should never lose a game.,Darrell Royal: (1957–1976)::: compiling a career college football record of 184–60–5. In his 20 seasons at Texas::: Royal's teams won three national championships (1963::: 1969::: and 1970)::: 11 Southwest Conference titles::: and amassed a record of 167–47–5. He won more games than any other coach in Texas Longhorns football history. Wikipedia,There better be a great replacement hiding in CDC’s office,Think of all of the laid off and furloughed staff from earlier this year when we put Herman all of that dead buyout money.,Boosters and “fans” will keep calling for the coach’s head every 3-4 years if unrealistic expectations aren’t met and we’ll keep going in this vicious circle of getting nowhere. Was Herman perfect? Of course not but it takes time to build a program/team. Talented players aren’t going to come to a program that’s a revolving door for coaches. Talented coaches aren’t going to come to a program where spineless AD’s claim the current coach is their man and then fire him days later - after a strong bowl win.,I was hoping that Herman would be given at least another year. Before the end of this season CDC stated that Herman would remain as head coach. It’s difficult to build a football program when a coaching change is being made every 3-4 years. What prospective coach will want to come to Texas with this type of uncertainty?,Wait::: there’s people that think Herman deserved to keep his job?? He couldn’t win the Big 12 in a down year with a 4th year senior QB and a rebuilding OU. Not to mention recruiting is an absolute mess. We were most definitely NOT moving in the right direction.,"I sure hope the adults retake control of the asylum! These kids can either comply with the rules and traditions of the University or go someplace else!

It’s called discipline and facing the consequences of your decisions. It’s part of growing up and being an adult!

Changing a head coach is not a magic wand::: until the University administration grows a pair the school and football program will continue to suffer. Regardless of who is Coach!",Don’t extend a coaches contact and then turn around and let them go. Herman was probably going to put his best team on the field next year. If things weren’t going to work then::: then perhaps it was time. But four years is not enough time for a coach to build a program. You are starting a revolving door of coaches and your selections are not looking any better.,Sarkisian has a real checkered past. I hope you know what you’re getting. It’s easy to look awesome at Alabama. Wait until we lose to OU again::: and the fan base wants his head. Let’s see how he handles it. He was a massive failure at the University of Washington.,I was so hopeful for coach Herman::: but it appears he will be a better fit somewhere else. Now...lets go find someone amazing!! HOOK EM!,I remember when Tom Herman was LSU's first choice to replace Les Miles::: but Herman chose UT and LSU got stuck with Ed Orgeron.,I wish y'all would give them minimum 4 yrs... he will have all his recruits. no one will want to coach there if you can't give them time to get the team in sync.,Maybe this is a player issue and not a coaching thing. 🤷‍♀️ How many coaches have to be fired/hired? I think it's time to start looking at the players. 🤔,For me this is a lateral move at best. You don't fire the coach with 1st year OC and Dcs if you are going after Sark. You ONLY do this if you go after the big fish like Meyer....,This why Texas never meets expectations. Maybe they need a new athletic director.,Sarkisian really? The guy who took over the best offense in the NFL and ran it into the ground? Or who flamed out at USC? Here’s a hint::: he’s not the reason Bama is the team they are. Not a Herman fan but this is a lateral move if not a step back.,Pity that money won't be going to actual students (and faculty::: most especially). Those salaries are obscene.,"Where’s your dedication to Coach Herman...U people R embarrassing the University of Texas.
(15 million to buyout Herman & a total of 24 million for him & his coaching staff)",One of Herman biggest problems was game management. He blew several games over the 4 years.,Not saying this isn’t the right move BUT the University just a couple of weeks ago put out a National press release that Herman was staying. What exactly happened in less than a month?,If I was running a university during a global pandemic::: I would have deferred participation in sports until the pandemic was brought under control. Firing a football coach right now is doubling down on dumb.,For every million UT pays a coach to leave::: it should match dollar for dollar hiring exceptional professors.,Herman reaped what he sowed. Left UH for the bigger prize before their season was over. Didn’t even see it through. Real leaders don’t do that to students who trusted them. UT will be better off without him.,I wonder if Mack would come back.,Herman doesn’t develop players on campus. He needed to be gone. Let’s go someone who can develop top talent into elite talent.,I can't even begin to explain to y'all how stupid this was. I don't think Herman is the second coming or anything::: but there's no one better available and he has made progress. Sarkisian is a joke::: so I hope you don't bring him in.,Remember when y'all fired 2006 coach of the year and national champion Mack Brown? Pepperidge Farm does not remember because they are mindless::: incredibly delicious cookies.,In a year or two::: the program will be evaluating Chris Del Conte position because you messed up in the firing of Coach Herman.,Record doesn't matter::: the loss of major recruiting wins spelled the end. We have to recruit great players::: develop them::: win and send them to the NFL to build an Alabama and Ohio State program.,WTF!! I hate the way our Boosters and Director think.. Tom has yet to have a loosing season::: they don’t allow a culture to be built.. if this is a win now league::: he’s been winning!,You just can't change a program around in 3 years come on!!!! thanks coach Herman!!! Hookem Horns!!!,This change doesn't surprise me::: but it is a bit disappointing.,Dang it must suck being a coach at Texas! No loyalty! Unless your name is Smart I guess. They sure do want their exes::: fans and donors to be loyal though!,Tom Hermann days were numbered Del Conte has to hire a good recruiter as well as a great Coach Urban MEYER should be the guy...We should be hiring a winner just cause he is the Offense Co-Ordinator at Alabama.. hire some who knows how to win and has a offensive skill set and recruits best players ... alot of these Texas high schoolers are going to bigger schools like Ohio State is ahead of Texas .. we need URBAN MEYER!! No doubt in my mind!! Not Sarkastian he had a terrible record at USC,This is Texas::: we generate two billion. Herman was not the answer. CDC and the regents showed some 🥜 and got him gone! Now quiet the bigots so we can get back to dominating recruiting again. No kids coming to play for a hateful fan base demanding kids just ignore blatantly offensive culture. No change the culture! Alabama definitely understands that::: how's that going for them? 🤔,Karma. He accepted a new contract at U of H and bailed for Texas leaving U of H without a coach and players leaving because he left.,It's about time. Now go make a real hire. Not another G5 coach or that drunk Sark.,You do not get to records like the following by changing coaches every four years::: plizzz,Thanks. You just condemned us to who knows how many more years of “rebuilding”.,Foolish. If you're getting urban meyer that's one thing::: but sark? C'mon longhorns.,Toxic environment and unrealistic expectations. If Bijan was smart::: he would enter the transfer portal today.,"Ok::: time to hire Jason Garrett. I am serious::: because ""Texas Football"" is so far up its own backside that you may as well shoot for the gutter.

Mac Brown got $5 million a year::: and everyone who has followed him has not ""met expectations"". If you already fired the $5 million a year guy::: WHO EXACTLY ARE YOU GOING TO GET?

Ah::: who cares::: boosters will pay another ""football building"" on campus because #SPORTSBALL while the schools on campus could use that more if not just as much for their own students as any player.",Herman let off field woke distractions infect the team. It’s about winning and having a tough::: game day attitude; every day. Practice like you play and play to win. Get the damn band back on the field too. If any of these students don’t like it or are offended::: show them the door. No nonsense. 🤘,They had him fired months ago. Just got the stones to do it after they were sure they could sign the OC from Bama.,"Tom Herman::: Texas Alum::: 54-22 as head coach::: 5-0 in bowl games::: 45 yrs young.
Steve Sarkisian::: 47-35 as HC::: 2-2 in bowl games::: 46yr
I don't see the step up on hiring him.",Get rid of CDC too. What has he ever done? Other than take a fat paycheck?,No patience anymore. Frank Solich and Larry Coker killed that 20 years ago.,What's with the bridge. When I was there we had to go down the hill to gym and back up the hill to classes.,Cool. Now do one saying y'all aren't seriously considering Steve Sarkisian. We'll wait.,Just say that we are not making the big money like the top four consistant programs...its all about the money.,Good he’s gone. Sark better re-establish the culture of accountability and play the best players regardless of tenure. Just compete and win. Recruit some dawgs and play to your strengths. Last but not least NEVER reads these blogs or comments.,Shame on you TEXAS! We were moving in the right direction but you want a quick draw quick win. Who do the players believe in? Who do the players support? I just wonder if the players on the field in the trenches are ever asked their opinion?!?!,I'm sorry but you are a bunch of over priced liers. You expect to much in so little time you are making it hard to still be a fan,They should’ve taken Nick Saban when they had the chance.,Not a good idea!! Coach Herman has been a good leader for the UT team.,So the liberal school hires a raging alcoholic.... yep that’s about right,Do they realize how bad this coaching carousel looks to recruits? We’re a laughing stock.,Steve Sarkisian / Urban Meyer can turn this program around instantly! They are both proven winners.,I mean to be fair how many years has Conte and group had to get Texas “on track” maybe it’s the guys hiring the coaches that need to be replaced. 🤔,They also need a new AD.,Sarc is a lateral move::: get ART he may be risky but huge payoff,Should never have run Brown off.,Another 3 year build and all of a sudden “hmm we need another coach”. Look at Shaka Smart,It takes more than a coach to win games!,Great! Let get an adult this time that can actually lead!!,"Mack Brown 1998–2013 Championships
BCS National Championship (2005)
2 Big 12 (2005::: 2009)
6 Big 12 South Division (1999::: 2001–2002::: 2005::: 2008–2009)

Paul ""Bear"" Bryant Award (2005)
Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Award (2008)
2× Big 12 Coach of the Year (2005::: 2009)",This program will never reach its peak because they give head coaches a 3 ft leash. The UT administration is a giant joke.,4 years to build a program? Absolutely pathetic!! Buy out Herman’s contract for $25 Million is it? With the high expectations the new coach better take the Horns to the NC game next season. Or he will be gone!!,How much is the buyout again ?,Shame on you Texas. Very disappointed,While you are at it:::fire Del Conte,So glad Del Conte extended Herman’s contract prematurely...,So maybe Mack would take us back?,How much was Herman's buy out,Nothing more constant than change!!!!,Maybe CDC needs to be replaced!,Wrong move UT::: so disappointed.,Translation ... our boosters are paying to fire him. Great backbone.,Nothing like being fired on social media !,That coach at North Carolina has his team in the Orange Bowl two years after it won 2 games. Excellent character too. Dude is a miracle worker. We should hire him!,He lost too many games to inferior opponents,Is this for real?,Another terrible move::: not surprising at this point,Hire Urban Meyer and stop screwing around! UT::: you have the money to get whomever you need!,“You are your record.” -Bill Parcels. 32-18 = mediocre.,Horrible::: stupid move. They need to get their heads/egos out of the sand.,Very ill advised decision. I'm more than disappointed with this decision.,Wow! They said couple weeks ago he was staying,So they hire a guy who will go outside the rules to win,Should have given him more time.,Steve Sarkisian is the rumor,The University of Texas at Austin Can y’all stop asking alumni for donations now? Since you basically just threw it all away..,Bring back the Mack Attack!,Ambitious people are never satisfied no matter how much they get.,"Just another YUUUUUUUUUUUUUG
E waste of money by UT.",I'm sure old 7-win Sark will absolutely do much better 🤣😂🤣😂,Cliff’s Notes: Chris pressured by rich donors to make a stupid decision.,Took long enough yall ain't take this long for Strong!,Bring back #Strong 🥶🙏🤔🤬😷🤡🇺🇸🙀🙃😀😡,Saw that coming from a mile away,Wow! Thought they had just extended him last month,The very best coach is available ! Urban Meyer !!!!,i had bad feeling was going happen .i was nevet fan of his,tl;dr coach sucks::: he's getting the boot,I knew as soon as we picked up head coach from American Athletic Conference::: also known as recreation football it was a complete loss.,Horrible decision by CDC. We will have to deal with it,This is why I don't give a flip for college football. Stupid crap.,Steve Sarkisian will be the next coach.,Big oof,This came as a surprise to me...😲,How many growing years does TU need? Asking for a friend,Alper Orkun Is Texas back now?,Good job::: now stop paying coaches 5 million dollars an year. Instead help some less fortunate kids get a college education and invest more in improving standard of education. I wish it was outlawed for college coaches to get paid that kind of money when the kids playing cant legally make any money.,Herman needed to go::: he sucked and he hated the fan base!!!,I mean::: honestly::: if y’all send out any kind of fundraising emails to anyone over the next few years::: expect them to just respond with screenshots like this 🤷🏼‍♀️,"Kristy Roberts Brittany Rosentreter

Y’all see this?","Come on! You did the same thing with Charlie too! You’re going to change this from being a coach’s dream job to nobody wanting to coach here because you shitcan everyone if they’re not playing for national championships immediately.

Charlie Strong and Tom Herman both coached for a combined 7 years.

The problem is not the coaching. The problem is the administration.
You should all be fired too.",How can you fire him during a covid season? Think this program was on the right track. Recruiting needs to get better defensive wise.. Think that's the key,Your a bunch of damn idiots down there you have fired better coaches than most teams have had Rick Barnes::: Mac Brown now Tom Herman. Maybe you need to hold yourself responsible and fire yourself,"I think it looks pretty terrible for the “flagship university” of Texas to just throw away $25m on contract payouts during COVID-19. Talk about tone deaf. There are thousands of students (and student-athlete
s)::: faculty and staff - and alumni::: I’m sure - struggling financially to make ends meet. It’s a slap in their faces. Truly not at all proud to be an alum today.","In plain English ""The Money People for the UT Alumni have decided that the present Coach hasn't done enough to guarantee the Football Team will not be the CASH COW it has been in the past for the University and can't bring in the Millions of Dollars that we want to grossly abuse as we see fit so we can take greater advantage of the disadvantaged youth we get to sell their soul to the program for the benefit of UT and it's underdeveloped sense of importance. So we hereby FIRE him for the next money making idiot we can recruit""!","""student athletes"" That's hilarious.",And the decision to hire a known drunk is thought to be better?!

socialist country. I'm a Black American man & the word racist has lost it's meaning. Liberals: "" If you don't wear a mask you're RACIST! If you vote for Trump or Republican you're RACIST! Civil War Oregon game is RACIST! Texas song is RACIST!

All Longhorns will eventually be able to get a vaccine as the university receives more doses. Distribution will follow state and federal guidelines. We’re committed to making sure you know how::: when and where you can get the vaccine when they’re available. Stay updated: protect.utexas.edu/vaccine #ProtectTexasTogether,2020-12-18 21:56:41,"For those of you commenting unfairness and who should get the vaccine first......plea
se read!!!! It says “as the University gets more doses” and “distribution will follow state and federal guidelines.”",Good thing the anti vaxxers here letting everyone know they don’t want it aren’t even Longhorns - you don’t have to get it!,I am grateful I have already had the opportunity to be vaccinated as a physician. The science behind this vaccine is clean::: and I had no hesitation getting my shot. I have also experienced no side effects. Although I am young::: healthy::: and not at risk of COVID related complications::: I consider it my duty to my community to get vaccinated and prevent spread. Also::: I really want to see my older relatives again and feel confident they’ll be safe!,This is more injustice with regard to testing::: therapeutics and now the vaccine. Sad to read this about my alma mater when MANY alums who are at increased risk due to age and underlying conditions are waiting.,Yes please. I'm ready. I get all my shots. Sadly::: as we grow older::: our immune systems weaken. I'd advise everyone to go get their shots.,That's not fair. It should be in this order: Elderly::: people with heart and lungs disease::: healthcare workers::: law enforcement::: military::: teachers::: service industry workers::: everyone else::: and then politicians. In that order.,Also I’m positive that they’ll give it to students after they give it to medical personnel and others who need it,We are grateful that soon the Government will provide the C19 Vaccine to the Indonesian people::: we hope that the C19 Pandemic Virus::: can end all over the world ..,I had my first shot of the Pfizer vaccine yesterday 😁 No problems!,That age group should be the very last vaccinated::: if at all. Almost zero risk of any kind from the disease. Please vaccinate older people first.,Proud UT grad here. But just wondering how this is even possible this early on in the vaccine distribution. Most medical schools in Texas will have to wait to vaccinate their students who are rounding in both inpatient and outpatient settings with COVID positive patients until the beginning of phase 2 and some in phase 3.,What about ems::: apd:::&afd and all first responders are not getting theirs first. They are in contact with more people the may have been infected than the UT students that are going home for 3 weeks. That’s ridiculous.,If you do not want the vaccine::: step aside. There are others who will gladly cut in line in front of you.,Amye Burt Patel,Those that don’t believe in science and will not be taking it::: thank you. That just means I move up in line to get mine.,1. Don’t get it if you don’t want it. It’s not being forced. 2. If your kid is over 18::: they are the adult now. They choose whether or not they want to take the vaccine. Personally::: I think there is absolutely no reason not to get vaccinated at this time::: but hey::: people do (or do not do) weird things for weird reasons every single day. Hook Em! And this Kevin🤦‍♀️.,I’m wondering why these young people or professors are getting before older people with health problems!!!! 😡,Thanks UT! My Longhorn will be there to get one!,Unless they are healthcare workers or are in nursing homes how is this possible? 🤔😡,Why would someone comment or troll on a university feed they didn’t attend? There are some real creeps out there.,How about those of us in the outback,This vaccine has aborted fetal tissue in it.,Here’s a tip: Try reading the article before you comment on it! The university is following the state and federal guidelines for distribution.,Wait::: so football players can get the vaccine now but me::: HIGH RISK::: I’m being told I have to wait until March?? Wtf?,I won’t hesitate when the vaccine is available!,Does this include emeritus professors too??,"Hi pro-lifers::: here’s an informative chart in case you wanted to know which COVID vaccines used abortion-derive

It is an advertisement of sorts. So don't tell me I can't express my views on the subject. Because I am not an Austin longhorn fan or a U.T. Alumni. Just because a shill from Astra Zeneca tells you something does not make it true. I have bought used cars from people who told me something false about the car. Only to find out after the car is in my driveway when it is too late to take it back. I hope the Astra Zeneca representative is accurate but when it comes to something as dire as the ingredients of a potion being injected into my body begs the question as to the integrity of the manufacturer.,"Great news!!!

2710f7 2 U.S. Healthcare Workers Suffer Allergic Reaction to Pfizer COVID Vaccine. How Many More Are at Risk?

Healthcare worker hospitalized after receiving Pfizer COVID vaccine
Two days after the first COVID-19 vaccine was administered in the U.S. — to a healthcare worker in Long Island::: New York — two healthcare workers in Alaska who received Pfizer’s COVID vaccine experienced allergic reactions. One of those::: a woman with no prior history of allergies::: suffered an anaphylactic reaction and spent at least two nights in the hospital.
The reactions::: similar to those experienced on Dec. 8::: shortly after rollout of the same Pfizer vaccine in the UK::: raise renewed concerns about the potential for life-threatenin
g reactions to the vaccine.
Those concerns include the vaccine maker’s exclusion of people with severe allergies from the clinical trials::: and the failure to pre-screen patients for polyethylene glycol (PEG)::: the compound suspected of triggering the reactions::: before administering the vaccine.
An initial investigation into the allergic reactions experienced by the two UK healthcare workers identified PEG as the likely trigger for those anaphylactic reactions.
In September::: Children’s Health Defense’s chairman and chief legal counsel::: Robert F. Kennedy::: Jr.::: warned the FDA about the potential for vaccines containing PEG — an ingredient used in the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines — to cause severe allergic reactions.
On learning Wednesday of the hospitalization
of the woman in Alaska::: Kennedy said:
“When we warned FDA Director Peter Marks that the nanoparticles in this vaccine pose deadly risks from anaphylaxis::: he suggested we take our concerns directly to the vaccine makers. We clearly have a systematic problem when government health regulators have utterly abdicated their responsibility to safeguard public health and refer safety concerns about shoddily tested::: zero-liability vaccines to pharmaceutical companies.”
Vaccine makers have zero legal or financial incentive to make their products safe::: Kennedy added. “Let’s remember that Pfizer will make billions so long as it keeps its vaccine in play::: no matter how many people experience life-threatenin
g reactions:::” he said.
A spokeswoman for Pfizer told the Washington Post the company is “actively working with local health authorities to assess” what happened in Alaska. She also told the Post that prospective participants in Pfizer’s late-stage clinical trial were excluded if they had a history of severe allergic reactions associated with a vaccine or to any component of this vaccine.
“Clearly::: this fact has fallen on deaf ears:::” Children’s Health Defense’s President Lyn Redwood said in reference to Alaska’s Chief Medical Officer Dr. Anne Zink’s comment to PBS: “There were over 40:::000 people in the trials and we did not see any reactions like this.”
“Of course we didn’t see any reactions:::” Redwood explained. “People who had previous reactions to vaccines were excluded from the trials.”
Zink also relayed a comment made by someone who treated the Alaskan woman’s adverse reaction: “Lightning’s going to strike somewhere.” But Redwood wasn’t reassured. “Lightning strikes in the U.S. 20 million times a year:::” she said.
CDC guidance on potential PEG allergies falls short
CDC guidance says people with a history of severe reactions to other vaccines or injectable therapy “may still receive vaccination::: but they should be counseled about the unknown risks of developing a severe allergic reaction:::” the Washington Post reported. “People who have mild allergies to food::: pets::: environment or latex can still get the Pfizer-BioNTech
vaccine.”
According to Redwood::: PEG allergies often go unrecognized which means individuals who have no history of allergies::: like the healthcare worker in Alaska::: could have severe life-threatenin
g reactions to PEG.
According to research published in 2018::: there are more than 1:::000 products on the market — including pharmaceuticals
::: processed foods::: cosmetics and disinfectants — that contain PEG.
“The decision to allow people with other drug allergies to receive the Pfizer vaccine is a very risky proposition:::” Redwood said. She explained that it’s common that patients and doctors have no idea what compound in a drug caused their adverse reaction. “If that compound was PEG::: it would be very dangerous to administer a vaccine containing PEG::: as that next reaction could be more severe:::” Redwood said.
With plans to vaccinate “tens of millions” of people in the U.S. alone::: Redwood is very concerned. She wonders how many people with no prior history of allergies are potentially at risk of a severe reaction to COVID vaccines that contain PEG.
Pfizer claims anaphylactic reactions to vaccines in general are rare::: estimated at just over one per million doses. But Redwood said the more likely answer to how many people are at risk is “we don’t know.”
Anti-PEG antibodies have been detected not only in patients treated with PEGylated therapeutics::: but also in individuals who have no knowledge of PEG exposures.",Diego Flores,Don't do it!!

"Dan Rather is now more than an icon — he’s the namesake of new awards honoring his career and the work of today’s journalists.

The Moody College of Communication - UT Austin and the School of Journalism - University of Texas at Austin have established the Dan Rather Medals for News and Guts to recognize collegiate and professional journalists who overcome obstacles like stonewalling and harassment to speak truth to power.

Awards are $5:::000 each in the collegiate and professional categories::: and applications will be accepted 1/2/21 - 2/1/21: https://danrathermedals.com",2020-12-16 17:03:12,"Be better! My alma mater has embraced revisionist history too often lately.
Truth is truth and Dan Rather knowingly spread a false story to try and damage Bush 43. He doesn’t deserve any positive recognition.","It is literally like the leadership at Texas is trying to give its alumni base more and more arguments not to financially support their university. The ""Eyes"" mishandling and now this. Truly incredulous !",Poor choice for an award. Rather is one of the pioneers for all that is wrong with journalism today.,Shameful UT and Moody College. Rather was fired for lying. I really wouldn’t call him a journalist::: but he is an opinion personality. Follow him on social media.... nothing about his work is true journalism.,Wasn't he fired from his most prestigious positions for lying and advancing his own personal agenda? You know::: the exact opposite of the duties of an actual journalist? (Checks notes) Indeed he was. This is a terrible look. Between this and the decision to keep Tom Herman::: The University of Texas has given itself one heck of a black eye over the past couple of weeks. It's embarrassing::: shameful and disgusting.,Is it the political activist pretending to be a journalist award ? If yes::: he is the poster child for such an award.,Honored for what?!?!? He made up a bogus story about Dubya and was fired by CBS over it!!!! Who wants to be associated with this medal!?!?!! Come on man!!!,Seems a little misguided given how his mainline career ended. Not a good look.,My parents went to high school with him and didn’t like him then. Their opinion of him went down from there. My dad might want his Longhorn card back. Bad choice UT. Think Barbara Jordan is rolling over in her grave.,Walter Cronkite is probably rolling over in his grave about right now...what an embarrassment to us Longhorns.,Well that’s certainly not a raving endorsement for those who believe there should be honesty in journalism.,Unethical anchorman. He stopped being a journalist a long time ago.,"That wouldn't happen if the free press was truly free and without bias. Mr. Rather was one of the most biased newsmen I've ever seen::: and now::: in his advanced years::: has had no compunctions about flaunting his left wing democrat bias.

The U of Texas has diminished itself today.",What a joke. Rather is an embarrassment to any fair-minded journalist. He lied about George W. Bush and had to be fired because of it. I don’t care about his politics but he put his politics above his journalism. I graduated in Broadcast Journalism and was taught to only report facts::: something Rather apparently forgot. The University of Texas should be embarrassed.,What is wrong with today’s world? They love to reward liars and cheaters::: instead if holding them accountable for their dishonest actions.,"The major irony here is that many in the comments are invoking the very reason this award exists to disqualify the person the award is named for.

As if networks haven’t dropped journalists for telling truths that are “too real.” Think of what CNN did to Marc Lamont Hill.

Move on::: nothing to see here. Solid move by UT.",Dan Rather is a joke. He allows his bias and his personal animosity against the Bush family to affect his work. He's no journalist. He's an activist.,Cronkite was perhaps the last real journalist,"Independent CBS report: ""The fact is that basic journalistic steps were not carried out in a manner consistent with accurate and fair reporting::: leading to countless misstatements and omissions in the reporting by 60 Minutes Wednesday and CBS News (and Dan Rather)."" Why name an award after someone who tried to promote a FALSE story about a Republican president during an election year? (Sound familiar?) Perhaps the question answers itself.",Is this a joke? His career ended in disgrace.,Surely Dan Rather has enough self respect to gracefully decline to accept such a misguided attempt to destroy the integrity of the University !,Come on Horns! What kind of crap is this?? Rather is a disgraced activist.,"He was fired for misrepresentati
on of the truth. Why would you want a award named after him. It’s like giving the humanitarian of the year award to Charles Manson.",Whoever made this decision has no idea what Dan Rather did. Dan was fired for wrong reporting. Shameful decision.,He was fired for making up a story. I guess he does represent today’s journalists though.,All you trolls go pick on someone else. This is a post about journalism not your poor sad fantasies. Enough negativity! Okay you can start bashing me now since that is your entertainment.,He is a disgraced “journalist” caught lying. How in the world can you name an award after him? Unless this is like a raspberry?,He made up stories! He didn’t care who he defamed! #Hornsdown!,It’s hard to believe!,"The guy disgraced himself with his partisanship.
I suppose::: in a way::: it's a good thing that he stopped even pretending to be objective toward the end of his career.
An award? No.
Oh wait::: his partisanship was on the liberal side. Rain awards upon him::: then.",Sounds like the perfect award for present era journalists.,"Rather disgraced himself with insane conspiracy theories about President Bush.

No self respecting journalist would be caught dead on a stage with this hack.",I seem to remember him concocting a hit job on President George Bush that turned out to be false and he lost his job. Is this the person you are honoring? For shame!,Yall know he lied and made up a story and then reported it as news right?,This award will be given to the social justice warriors..no doubt. Calling it truth is an oxymoron::: Ive seen what some of the school paper's journalists produce.,Does it honor journalist who make up their own news stories then lie to cover it?,Dan Rather is to journalism what Cheeze Whiz is to French cuisine.,Dan Rather is the father of everything that is wrong with journalism today. Not sure how someone with a reputation for lying needs to have a medal named after them.,Dan Rather had to resign in disgrace after pushing a ridiculous partisan narrative using fraudulent documents.,Wasn’t he fired for lying about Bush?,Lol!! UT honoring the guy who was fired for making up a story to try to damage the President. Now days you get a big promotion at CNN for doing that,🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️ A man who fabricated stories is now being honored by the Moody School....what the hell for?,Dan was basically fired for reporting on Bush’s National Guard record that he knew was false. Great role model.,This is the wrong Texas school to be an Aggie joke.,When I was at UT::: Peter Jennings was the news anchor I saw on television screens tuned in on campus.,"His real name is Daniel Jones. The network changed his last name because he is ""Rather Biased"".",Why not use MSNBC Brian Williams he lied Twice lol he would fit your narrative...,If all of you who are responding are UT alumni::: you certainly didn't pick up any grammar or spelling while there (I am also a UT alumna).,What about the fake National Guard letter he pushed during the Bush years? Are we going to ignore that?,Is this a spoof?,"Followed closely by the Chris Simms Award of popsickle-stick
s for best Quarterbackery.",Aren’t journalists supposed to be unbiased?,remember::: he fabricated the National Guard story about George W::: and immediately resigned thereafter.,I remember when he was on Houston news during Hurricane Carla. Memories are one advantage of growing older.😂,So we reward liars and the selfish now! What happened to my beloved University!?,Does the biggest lie win the prize?,How many meteorologists have suffered injury feeling the need to cover hurricanes and tornadoes in the manner that Dan Rather cover Carla hitching Galveston?,The Left rewrites history::: and with it::: credibility,The “lamestream media” and “fake” news can trace its origins to Dan Rather. What am embarrassment to UT.,He’s a sham. Why would you put him on an award. I’d throw it back in their face.,So what you are really saying is journalism at UT is a joke.,Are you kidding me?? Dan Blather is a political hack and was caught red-handed lying about George W Bush and forced to resign in disgrace! I am soo embarrassed by my Alma Mater.......,So the university is officially honoring one of the first high profile practitioners of fake news? How predictable. Somewhat like the Nobel committee giving their award to a POTUS that was authorizing record numbers of drone strikes.,"First ""The Eyes of Texas""::: now this?",Didn’t he lie egregiously and get fired?,Edward R Murrow gets my vote “To be persuasive we must be believable; to be believable we must be credible; credible we must be truthful.”,Who’s going to determine what the truth is?,Have to agree with most of the comments. Why name anything after a disgraced/ dishonest person? I would expect such out of Trump University.,$5000? So now a student can buy one or possibly two books?,That is a awesome way to honor such a great man!!,An honor well deserved!,"What is next?

A Harvey Weinstein Medal for Standing Against Sexual Assault?",You've got to be joking ? Is this the UT Onion ?,Does the reverse side have a picture of his fax machine?,Speaking candidly is not bad as long as u have point in saying for that and having that basis.,Thought I started following The Onion for a second.,WHAT???? It must be the unethical award for journalism. Unbelievable! I’m embarrassed for UT,An all time low for UT Journalism. POOR CHOICE. Disappointed in my Alma Mater.,How appropriate that an arrogant fraud stands as the face of excellence for this dying profession. Honestly I’d rather my kids do porn than journalism::: more self respect there.,Very nice Gentleman. I met him several times.,You do know Dan Rather is the king of fake news right? This is a disgrace to UT Austin.,One of the most LIBERAL colleges in the U.S.. it’s what we expect.,Say::: Dan...!!,Very un-impressive UT.,You just lost all your credibility. He's a disgrace journalist who fabricated a story or at least knew it was fabricated. What a travesty.,The king of fake news. How embarrassing for UT.,Always a reason to not approve. Blah blah. Stone chuckers.,Good ol Dan Rather-biased!,Dan is my least favorite journalist.,SO UT give a Medal for liars::: fitting.....,Dan did not go to UT.,What an embarrassment .... go teasips,"Y'all gotta be the dumbest people in Journalism to give fake-news Dan Rather a medal. The medal should say::: ""Excellence In Biased News Fabrication"".",A total sham::: this man is an embarrassment to real journalism,This is grotesque.,And lies to everyone? Balderdash!,Dan Rather::: the Father of Fake News. Wonderful,I guarantee that 90% of butthurt alums commenting on this post about Rather’s political bias watch Fox News and think it’s unbiased.,What a piece of work! Worst choice!,"What do Joe Biden::: the Biden family::: the Devil's Dominion Voting Systems::: Mark Zuckerberg & Priscilla Chan all have in common?

Journalism is dead...,Eat ‘Em Up Kats!,Should be Cronkite. Now there was a journalist with integrity,Is this a joke?,"These comments are ridiculous. ""He lied about Bush::: he made up stories::: his career ended in disgrace"". Blah blah.
Let's not forget that this man for whom we now have an award for ""speaking truth to power"" was one of the many::: loud::: prominent::: and (crucially trusted) media voices acting as a cheerleader for the Bush admin in the run up to and for the first several years of the Iraq War.
A war that was illegal::: based on lies::: and which is still going on 17 years later.
The only people speaking truth to power these last two decades have been those calling for an end to these wars. Rather may have eventually become one of those people::: but it took him YEARS to get there.
This is the real problem with his legacy and with this award.",Dan Rather made false reports cool before fake news was normal!,He's a disgrace to journalism.,What a joke ! Are you kidding me ::: I guess who have to be a liar and a fake to get this !,"So::: if the person is on the left::: their past is scrubbed?

Perhaps the question answers itself.",I am one of the 498 folks(out of 533) who liked or loved this post. I will not make a ridiculous comment::: and will congratulate the winners when they are announced.,He's a fraud but then so are a lot of awards like these.

Starting at 8 am this morning::: UT Health Austin and Dell Med staff::: alongside The University of Texas at Austin College of Pharmacy and University of Texas Austin School of Nursing::: began delivering COVID-19 vaccines to frontline healthcare workers. This is an exciting first::: and we're honored and humbled to be able to deliver the vaccine to our hardworking health care professionals who have been keeping the community healthy for months.

There are plans to deliver the first dose to about 300 clinicians from UT Health Austin and Dell Med today. In a few weeks::: they will return to get the second round of vaccination. In between doses::: it will be important for those vaccinated::: and people in the community who have not had the opportunity to be vaccinated yet::: to continue to practice social distancing and wearing a face covering.",2020-12-15 16:10:13,Thank you health care workers!

December 14::: 2020 at 2:18 PM ·

The first COVID-19 vaccines are here! This morning 2:::925 doses were delivered to UT Health Austin::: and starting tomorrow they will be distributed to Dell Med frontline health care workers.

We are excited and grateful to be able to receive and administer these vaccines to our clinicians who have been caring for and keeping our community healthy for months. This is an exciting step and the start of a new phase of the pandemic.

To learn more about The University of Texas at Austin vaccine plans please check out the Protect Texas Together website: https://protect.utexas.edu/vaccine/

And if you are not in Austin you can find statewide vaccine information and plans here: https://bit.ly/34fH1to",2020-12-14 21:37:30,Thank you President Trump for Warp Speed of the vaccine.,So::: you have to get 2 doses of the vaccine::: a first one and then a second 3 weeks later. CDC says that there are side effects..which can be concerning where this vaccine has not had the time to be monitored for a lenghty period of time to confirm what they can be as it can vary from person to person. Also::: the CDC said that even if you get the vaccine::: you will still need to wear a face mask and practice social distance. So::: you tell me::: is it worth taking something that can be found to cause serious side effects (we don't know because it hasn't been tested long enough) and still have to wear a face mask and social distance? How are things going to be any better?,France is waiting end of 2021 becauae still uncertain of side effects...i'm 56 and think it is a wise choice to wait....,Did you noticed that none are mailed through the USPS ::: but your votes were. :::!!,"These comments are why we can't have nice things. I can't help noticing that so many of the people who are now saying they're not gonna take the vaccine (more for the rest of us!) have already been vaccinated from things like polio::: mumps::: measles::: rubella::: whooping cough::: and other diseases. So their parents or grandparents watched children dying of these diseases every year while they prayed and begged for a vaccine so their loved ones could one day grow up to be.... science-deniers
?",Just heard it won’t necessarily keep you from getting Covid::: similar to the “flu” shot. I will take my chances with supplements that I know will keep me healthy versus an unproven shot. Please go ahead of me and let’s see what the outcome is.,I cannot wait to get my vaccine. Just because we have had a despicable president who cannot tell the truth::: many people have died and will continue to die.,Way to go Horns! Thank you. Thank you for everyone that lit a fire under pencil pushers to get this vaccine distributed.,Will the vaccine be given over time? Or will Dell Med take a chance that frontline workers all get sick at the same time? The most commonly reported side effect among vaccine recipients under age 55 was a sore arm::: followed by fatigue (60% after the second shot); headache (52% after the second shot); other muscle aches (37%); and chills (35%). About 28% took pain medication after the first shot and 45% after the second shot.,I’m a patriotic American. I’m a good neighbor. I’m getting the vaccine. Thank you front line workers.,People take vaccines all the time to help keep our society as a whole safe (MMR::: smallpox::: flu shot::: etc.). Everyone needs to get this vaccine unless they have a serious medical reason to be excluded. Vaccines save lives!,Do these vaccines have side effects?,I have a smart sister! And my sister has a smart sister! 😂😍👍,I wont need one. Not enough data for heart patients or cancer survivors taking them.,These comments mostly highlight what is wrong with our country.,I thought biden and his flunkies said it would be the end of next year or even the year after! Must have been another one of his lies he told.,DO NOT give one of those vaccines to my granddaughter!,Bless all of our health care professionals and all others that keep us healthy. I am right in line behind you,YES!! All the Dems in Austin should be required to go first! #KeepTexasRed,I pray God will bless this vaccine and it will do what it is intended to do without complications or side effects!! To God be the glory!!,Don't drink the kool-aid people,What about years down the road? If the mRNA trains your body to attack Covid cells::: what if a girl who had Covid and then had the vaccine later gets pregnant and the fetus has some Covid cells in it? Will her body attack the fetus? Very scary to think about.,"Awesome 👏🏼
Shout out to all on the front lines !!",I've had natural antibodies for months.....I think I'm good.,Now that the phoney election is over the democraps have stumbled onto a vaccine nearly a year after the fact???? WHATEVER,Still taking it. There are limited risks with any vaccine::: but they save lives.,Will be taking it too!,I will take it instantly when it comes my time!,"Amazon::: FedEx or UPS? Who delivers something as important as a vaccine in a shipping box......unreal
.",I can’t wait to get mine!,all the people calling those who get the vaccine “sheeple” are the same ones that believed so strongly in the man that told the public to use uv treatment and to inject bleach,Did you not take the sugar cube for polio?,Well I think we can all agree that people like Amye Burt Patel are what is fundamentally wrong with the USA. Narcissism at its finest.,Can’t wait-it’s no more riskier than a flu shot each year👍,Are these inoculations or vaccines? There is a difference.,Where did the vaccines come from?,At my age I would be a fool not to take the vaccine.,I already had Covid so I'm not taking it. The virus was bad enough.,Good now maybe the snowflakes will get vaccinated and shut up.,I’m not either!,A very good step::: to prevent the spread of Covid 19.,Thank you to all those serving on the front lines! When it's my turn::: I will *be there* with a tank top on.,Is it voluntary?,"By all means::: listen to random commenters on FB instead of doctors. https://

Now::: 104 years later::: BEVO XV reigns as the best mascot in sports.

Sorry the boys let you down this year. Let’s look forward to 2021.,The highest paid ::: underacheiving team in Texas History. And you thought Coach Strong was wrong.. Hermann is still living off of his one year at UH ::: which was made up of Tony Levine's players.. So::: Hermann is now content to win 1/2 of this games. Why should he care::: the Athletic Director was dumb enough to give him a guaranteed contract::: so he knows his job is secure::: regardless of their record. Hermann will never be known as even an average coach. He is a con man ::: disquised as a football coach. Just barely winning seems to be the normal acceptable result at ut. What if they were in a REAL conference::: instead of the weakes of the power 5. He says he loves his wife::: but I guess she doesn't mind him and some of his 'buddies' going to strip joints and bars..,Bevo is such a handsome steer!,Joe Jeter and Kevin Minx::: agree.

"When Julius Whittier stepped onto our campus in the fall of 1969 as one of the first Black student-athletes to receive a scholarship::: he was looking to make a lasting impact on both the football team and the University. Today::: as we commemorate the 50th Anniversary of the 1970 National Championship team that he was a part of::: the pioneer::: trailblazer and Longhorn Legend is immortalized with a statue just outside of the north end of Darrell K Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium.

The unveiling of the statue marks the culmination of efforts by Texas Athletics::: the University::: Longhorn alumni and supporters::: as well as current student-athletes to honor Whittier::: who in 1970 became the first Black letterman in Texas Football history.

Whittier earned three varsity letters as an offensive lineman (1970-71) and tight end (1972) at Texas. Though not eligible to play on the varsity team as a freshman per NCAA rules::: he enrolled at UT and joined Coach Royal's program as a scholarship student-athlete in 1969. Texas won the National Championship that year and again during Whittier's sophomore year in 1970.

Whittier achieved a great deal of success off the field::: as well. After receiving his undergraduate degree in philosophy::: Whittier went on to earn a graduate degree from The LBJ School of Public Affairs in 1976 and later completed his law degree at UT. For much of his professional career::: he worked as a senior prosecutor in the Dallas County District Attorney's office before retiring in 2012.

This statue one of the ways we say to Black Texans with renewed vigor: this is your university; we see your talents and we want to help you unlock them fully.

Other ways of saying this include the university’s plan for a new monument on the East Mall. It will honor the Precursors::: who in 1956 become the first group of African American undergraduates to integrate UT.

We’re also renaming the field at Darrell K Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium in honor of Heisman Trophy winners Earl Campbell and Ricky Williams.

Symbolism is important::: but without structural change it can ring hollow. With this in mind::: the university has made a new multi-million-dollar commitment from Athletics revenue to support programs that seek to recruit::: attract::: retain and support Black students here on campus.

And we’re proud that the Longhorns are expanding the 4Ever Texas program that helps student-athletes prepare for life after athletics — that is::: to follow in Julius Whittier’s footsteps.

"The Eyes of Texas is our alma mater and will remain so. As part of our efforts to better understand both its history and legacies::: we invite all members of Longhorn Nation to share their memories of and experiences with the song.

The Eyes of Texas History Committee::: commissioned earlier this year by President Jay Hartzell::: is currently working to chronicle and document its 120-year-long history.

Sharing your experiences will help us all better understand the story of our song: https://utex.as/2IJQdhC",2020-11-20 20:39:40,I hear and sing it with a tremendous sense of pride in myself::: the university::: the state. It means we all came together to support our teams::: we worked really hard to get the degree. It brings a tear to my eye when I hear it sung.,I will never forget my freshman year at my first football game as an official Longhorn. The Showband of the Southwest marched in the stadium and I held my horns up and sang “Eyes” loud and proud. As a proud Lifetime Texas Ex::: that pride runs deeper than ever. Fast forward to the first time my daughter stepped onto the field as an official Longhorn Band trombonist. Once again::: I held my horns up and sang “Eyes” loud and proud with my daughter playing our Alma mater song. Hook ‘Em forever. 🧡🤘.,I attended UT as a foreign student from Mexico 1956-1960::: lived in the Stag Coop::: shared a big house with 20 more students::: and specialized in cooking and serving breakfasts. Worked my way through part-time jobs::: my last two years as assistant translator for technical documents that UT's Petroleum Extension Service did for petroleum companies for their Venezuelan oil fields. Graduated 6/60 with a BSEE and have been a very proud and active Texas Ex ever since. I have been quoted as saying that 'next to marrying my wife 58 years ago::: attending UT was the best decision of my life'.....and I mean it!,I graduated from Texas in 1988::: nothing quite like singing the eyes of Texas after games win or lose::: who doesn't get chills listening to the Eyes of Texas after the end of the USC game? To me the song unites the students and the alumni::: demands excellence and holds us all accountable. Yes it is only a song but it is one hell of song for all who take pride in graduating from Texas. Hook'em,"The song tugs at my heartstrings and fills me with nostalgia. However::: I am ignorant of its history. I believe it is time for white people to sit down::: be quiet and LISTEN. Be willing to hear hard things and consider what part we’ve played in others’ pain::: confront our own biases::: reflect and pivot when necessary.
🤘Class of ‘93",I still get goosebumps everytime I hear that song. I remember singing it at the end of every football game. I remember it playing after I graduated. What we have here is an opinion of one disgruntled professor that has spread like cancer.,"My grandfather was from North Dakota::: my grandmother from New Jersey. They met at UT after he served in the Navy in WW2.

They went on to have my father::: who attended UT until he volunteered for Vietnam::: and became a Green Beret.

I was a college dropout::: bummed around working small jobs::: until I joined the Army. Did two tours overseas as a paratrooper::: and then came home to Texas. Moved to Austin with the intent to get into UT::: and spent 3 years at Austin Community College before applying to UT.

I was initially rejected::: then managed to get in on an appeal. It was a life goal finally seen to fruition::: 11 years after I graduated high school.

When we did transfer orientation::: and sang The Eyes of Texas::: I wept. 3 more years later::: I graduated 2019 with a BS in Aerospace engineering. A third generation Longhorn veteran.

To me::: the song reminds me that we are all one large community of alumni::: and while our talent and skills should be representative of any school::: it is our character::: class::: ethics::: and integrity that represents Texas.

Hook ‘Em

All the live long day.",Reading the comments in this thread makes clear to me - there is an enormous amount of educating and understanding that needs to happen here and I hope and pray::: beyond asking alums and students how the song made any one of us as individuals feel::: the University takes a leadership role in educating everyone on the history of the song. This appears to be a first attempt. We have to met the moment::: we have to decide to do this together and none of this is about a singular perspective. I’m so disappointed to see many comments that categorically deny or dismiss what some have dared to raise as a concern and experience with what we know includes a far less than stellar record of minority inclusivity and service. I don’t know where we will land on this one::: I don’t know the answer::: but I hope we honor what we were empowered to do by our university and I hope our university steps up and in to foster an inclusive::: level-setting and honest conversation. That’s the UT I’m proud of.,It’s not that we want to throw all tradition to the wind- but when traditions actively harm our students::: faculty::: and alumni::: it is time for them to go! Perception is more powerful than intention. If any part of our campus or practices make people feel unwelcome in their own school::: we owe it to them to make a change. I thought that what starts here changes the world::: but maybe what starts here just upholds antiquated::: racist policies..,"The song is not racist. It was created in a racist time period most likely by racist individuals and certainly preformed in a racist way. But there is not one racist word in it (actually shocking). I agree with removing statues of individuals who had no ties whatsoever to UT and even renaming a building named after a racist teacher. But leave The Eyes alone and remove scholarships of any band members who refuse to play it. This ""cancel culture"" we are currently living in is toxic... PC police go home!",You might want to educate these little 17:::18:::19 year olds that just because they read or heard someone that interpreted the song as racist does NOT it was...there was absolutely ZERO intent when the song was written and sung for decades,I remember singing this song at every game and then my Black friends told me that the song was actually racist and painful to their community::: so as a decent human being I understood that I should stop supporting it. If this song never meant anything racist to you::: that is privilege! I'm ashamed of this decision by my alma mater! /ɯ\\,I remember holding my hook 'em and singing it when I was elementary school::: hundreds of miles away. I remember doing the same thing at football games::: even when (during the Fred Akers era) we suffered the largest home loss in UT history as an undergrad. I remember singing it at my law school graduation. Now::: over 30 years later::: I still sing it::: often. What it meant before::: is not what it means now. I shall continue to proudly sing it.,Old::: old people huh. Well honey::: I was 58 when I graduated and proud of the tradition::: that it what makes your university yours.,"Why does anyone like this stupid song? It seems like most people that want to keep it are old and out of touch::: apparently they care more for a song than affording proper respect to POC. And then they hide behind the word ""tradition"". Tradition isn't what matters::: PROGRESS matters. Throw this stupid tradition out the window. The song is creepy AF.","Growing up::: we sang ‘The Eyes of Texas’ in school music classes. At special events we sang it. Everybody loved it::: and thought it was our state song. I was a teenager in 8th grade choir::: when introduced to ‘Texas::: Our Texas’ - when Alaska became a state. That is when the change in lyrics was made from “largest and grandest” to “boldest and grandest.” The only line I wonder about is “Till Gabriel Blows His Horn.“ However::: with the Bible verse John 8:32 engraved on the Tower::: it’s understandable.
I remember walking with my Dad across the campus before my freshman year::: and he pointed it out to me. “What is truth?”::: he asked::: and I was initiated into the intellectual questioning of The University. The culture of Texas is on the Tower::: and in the school song.","When I went to UT back in 1959::: that song always told me the eyes of my little hometown were on me: ""Was she gonna make it in a big school?"" I felt a real responsibility to do well. I knew I was being observed. I am 79 now. I have had several successful careers::: and retired from teaching about 10 years ago. Today::: with my music degree::: I record a different song every day (since mid-March) and post it for my friends on fb to encourage and raise spirits during these difficult times. I do not believe it is in the best interest of our nation to erase our history. Perhaps we should::: instead::: focus on learning from our history. Hook 'Em!",My mom died in 1996::: 5 years after I graduated from The University. It was her second battle with thyroid cancer. My father died in 2019 after a 4 year fight with dementia. I am Latino. I am an only child. I am first generation college. And every time I hear and sing The Eyes of Texas::: with tears in my eyes::: I am always teleported back to the 40 Acres::: DKR Football Stadium::: my freshman year::: when my parents and I sang the song together after a game with our horns held high::: with pride::: in the air. I cannot remember if we won or lost that game. But that memory. Singing our song. It can never be taken away. Hook 'em! And forever may The Eyes of Texas be upon us. 🤘🏽,"Total BS. The only people who should be offended by The ""Eyes"" of Texas are blind people !!! Now let the flames begin from all the PC people who doesn't get this joke...",I thought that the University of Texas was my alma mater.,Please preserve our Alma Mater as is!🤘,I loved the song for 53 yrs then I found out it was offensive to some African Americans because of its history. When I know better::: I do better. I will no longer listen::: stand::: participate::: sing::: recognize::: promote::: idolize a song that is hurtful to others. 🤘🏻🐂,It’s a school song sung by people who love this university. It shows pride and respect for the institution and those who have graduated from it. 3 generations of my family graduated from the University of Texas. Not one person sang our song with hate or malice in their heart::: nothing but pride and love.🧡🤘🧡hook’em,My dad got his PhD in education from UT and would sing the Eyes of Texas to me as a lullaby growing up. I graduated in 2012 with a degree in education. The song is now posted in my longhorn themed::: kinder classroom.,This song is super creepy! When I was a student there I cringed every time I heard it. Give it a rest,Thank you for leaving it alone!!!,"Maybe you need to kick the libtards back to California and not let them ruin Texas as well?
This comes from a Swede::: who spent three months in Cali and was appalled... ;)",It would behoove anyone that is interested in the origins to read Lee: The Last Years by Charles Bracelen Flood. As President of Washington and Lee University::: Lee wanted his students to be the example of the gentlemen of the South reuniting with the North and not to continue to be divisive. Lee would say the eyes of the south are upon you because he wanted his students to be the example of unification.,"It is disgusting that The University of Texas at Austin clearly will not put its students first::: especially the students who are time and time again underrepresente
d::: pushed aside::: and outright discriminated against. This university claims to care for marginalized communities and ""encourage their voices to be heard""; however::: when they do speak up about issues that cause them to be ISOLATED from the rest of the student body::: what does UT do? Nothing. Yeah what starts here changes the world::: for the white students that is.",Good do not let this wonderful tradition get thrown out.,I retired from the University of Texas System 9 years ago. I moved to a foreign country. My first year here I walked into a local well known store and there was an animated full size Santa Claus singing the Eyes of Texas.,First song I have taught to each grandchild. Taught them driving kawasaki mule on the ranch and sreamingly singing with them. Also remember freshmen orientation at kinsolving. Someone played it on the piano. All sang.,My daddy and I have been going to the games for 50 years straight until this year. Class of 1954::: '55 and '83. The Eyes of Texas are Upon You!,Not from Texas::: but the first game I ever attended gave me chills watching the team and the fans sing and give 🤘to the band::: while they played 'The Eyes of Texas'...wish I could get to more games and hearing that song always makes me wish I was from Texas!,As it should be...we don't change our school song because someone dug up obscure history. That's absurd!,"I travelled half way around the world from Islamabad::: Pakistan to Austin back in ‘96 to attend this amazing University. Having been a fan of football I picked up the lyrics of the song quickly::: having never heard it before. So while I can’t claim loyalty to the song for decades before joining UT::: it’s always been a reminder of good times at the stadium::: living in Jester West::: studying hard late at night and listening to TEX give me my grades over the phone! It’s been my connection to UT even though i left Austin and have lived in 5 different countries since I graduated 20 yrs ago. Yes some folks are upset at the historical background of the song. But that doesn’t mean I share any of the racist undertones that may be linked to this or any other symbol of the university. There is no culture / country in this world that does not have cruelty linked to sometime in its past. Tearing down symbols like songs::: statues and flags is taking the easy way out. Yes they should be brought down::: but that should be the last thing and not the first thing you do to change the mindset. First tear down the walls in the minds and hearts of people by understanding::: talking::: disagreeing::: laughing and crying together. That’s the tough part. Then we can dismantle any symbols that we collectively think need to be changed!!

I still stay up to watch the eyes of Texas and football games from Austin with pride::: even with an 8 hr time difference:) Be proud. Be kind. Be human. Hook ‘em!",Thank you for keeping this tradition.,"Some of the best memories of my life are of my time at UT. Graduating felt like I had truly earned a badge of honor. I worked harder than I have at anything since to get my degree. Sooo many memories of life on campus including football games (perhaps part of why I had to work so hard on my academics). I loved our complete arrogance of showing up as we pleased::: in our own time but never leaving before The Eyes played at the end. I think we sang that song 100 times at the top of our lungs on graduation day. When my son was born::: my lullaby repertoire was limited. I sang The Eyes of Texas and it worked like a charm to put him to sleep. When the band (the best band ever btw) plays the first few notes sort of announcing what's to come::: I get chills. Hearing that song while gazing at a brightly lit orange tower brings tears. #TexasExesLifeMe
mber","Kyle Field...2009. Colt’s last game in the Brazos Valley and he went off!! To be in that stadium::: singing our school song::: together as one big family::: with pride and emotion surrounded by a sea of Aggies....there
’s no better feeling in the world.",German House coop @ 2103 Nueces was a place of international friendships near campus. I used to lived there in the early 90s. Today::: it no longer exists::: unfortunately. Great story::: great history.,As a former student of Texas A&M::: I never had any issue with the words of Eyes of Texas and it is part of what makes our rivalry with UT special. I don’t see loyalty to your university through song an issue. I hope you guys don’t succumb to the whole politically correct police and continue singing Eyes of Texas for years to come. “ The eyes of Texas are upon you::: till Gabriel blows his horn!”,My dad was a student trainer under Darrel Royal. He and my mom both graduated from UT and bled orange. Some of my fondest memories of my childhood were getting up early on Saturday mornings and driving over to Austin to attend football and baseball games::: always concluding with singing “The Eyes of Texas”. I was thrilled to continue that tradition and proudly graduated from UT in 1992. My husband was a student athlete at UT (golf team) and then got his MBA. Our wedding cake was the UT tower and we sang “The Eyes of Texas” at our wedding. The tradition continued when our daughter began UT in 2017::: holding the same memories from her childhood that I loved so dearly. My dad passed away last October and his only request-sing the “Eyes of Texas” at his funeral. I watched as many an Aggie ring went in the air to sing the song that meant so much to my family. Every time I hear it::: I am filled with pride for my school and my family. 🤘🏻🧡,"My first grade teacher graduated from UT. We sang the ""Eyes of Texas"" every day after reciting the Pledge of Allegiance. It still gives me goose bumps all of these years later. Especially after beating someone. Long live the ""Eyes of Texas""",I hold the song in reverence::: right after “Texas::: Our Texas.”,It’s sad a race baiting professor had to make up a story to feed his students based on assumptions and not fact. The only source he used was from a newspaper article 20+ after the song was written. And written mocking the school presidents use of the term the eyes of the south are upon you. It was never racists and has been used to unify more students and alumni than anything else.,Throw this song into the trash can containing all the other racist crap that existed and continues to exist at UT.,It’s BS that people want to change the song and the culture to this university.,Andrew Chin You should certainly makesre that your speech and comments as outgoing SG president re the Eyes are placed in the record and given their proper context.,Why? It’s the school song that has been loved and sung for 120 years. Why can’t it be left at that? It seems every tiny particle of our lives are being atomically dissected to see if a word::: phrase::: “hidden meaning” might offend someone. Stop!!,Song should stay ::: don’t like go to aggieland.,Make sure you click the link and put your stories in to the university so your voices can be heard. Not just in the comments section here.,Because I shared it with my Dad it’s a great memory,Thank you for not caving!,"Better not sing Jingle Bells this Christmas season!

genuflectting or performing some sort of public prostration before that object offends you that deeply::: you don't need the song::: the flag::: or the statue. You need a bloody therapist.

It's a silly little song. Sing it::: don't sing it. But seriously::: why is this even an issue? With one of the largest enrollments and alumni populations in the world::: eventually UT will have to wake up to the idea that::: if it's a day ending in ""y""::: some student or alumni::: somewhere::: is offended by something.

B.A. '96 // B.S. '97",Don’t change A THING!! Love that song! Hook ‘em!!🤘🏼,"I grew up I’m Austin::: and my dad worked in the press box for U.T. games. I went to games often and developed a deep love and pride in The University. My blood ran orange from an early age. When it came time to go to college::: I only wanted to go to The University of Texas. That was my one and only application. I became part of The Longhorn Band::: my home base and center of my college years. As many times as we played The Eyes of Texas::: I never tired of it. The last time I played it as a member of the Longhorn Band::: I cried.

I met my husband through a band friend. We took our boys to Longhorn baseball::: basketball and football games as they grew up. Our older son became an avid U.T. fan::: and he went to two Rose Bowl games with us. He bled orange::: too.

He died ten years ago. For a year after his death::: my husband and I weren’t able to sing The Eyes of Texas at games. We would choke up.

The Eyes is such an integral part of our history as a university::: our identity as Longhorns and our pride and commitment to its future. It’s the glue that binds Longhorns together all over the world.",Johnny Willey,"When I was at UT::: I spent a year of my time in student advocacy trying to get white people on campus to understand how wrong it was to dress up in blackface for a themed frat house party because they were pretending to be ""thugs"". As obviously offensive as this was::: a group of students had to speak at SG for others to understand why black students were upset. Being expected to sing the EOT song in Student Government after sharing my perspective::: left me never wanting to sing it again. It was born out of a racist performance::: that if performed today would be frowned upon. Don't question why someone wants to get rid of it::: just understand how selfish and fucked up you sound when you argue to keep it.","https://

cist/",My father was #497 of the original TX Exes Life Members. He moved us to Austin from west Texas when I was young to not miss UT football. He told me The Eyes of Texas was the national anthem teaching me and my brothers almost as soon as we could talk. When I was in Kindergarten the teacher said we were going to learn the National anthem. I jumped up and said “I know it!” Proceeded to the front of the room threw up my Horns and sang The Eyes of Texas! When my teacher stopped laughing she told me that was not it and I argued because “my daddy told me so”. She had known my dad when he was growing up and called him to tell him and he laughed and told her “that’s my girl!” When he passed away in 2013 at the funeral my brother finished the service with “throw up your horns” and we all stood and sang The Eyes of Texas. So much of my life and that of my family’s was spent at UT events. I was sorry my dad missed my son’s graduation and all of us singing at the Tower.,"In the fall of 2000 I was an MC for the Torchlight parade::: I paid out of State Tuition at a time my family was starting to have financial challenges. I double majored and double minored (Gov/Honors Econ with minors in CompSci and Spanish). I was an Archer Fellow. I think you will find few people that bleed orange like me.

That having been said::: now that I know the full history of the song::: and the fact that it was at least partially inspired by Robert E Lee::: I'm MORE than happy to find a new tradition. It is a tiny sacrifice to make and a sign of love for our fellow Longhorns of Color.

The song is mortally wounded. Every time we play it on national TV::: viewers will be reminded that UT ends their events singing a song with a Confederate tinge::: and you are already probably going to have to threaten members of the band to get them to play it...is that who we want to be?

What start here changes the word...except when it comes to forging new legacies?","I was born in Houston to a native Texan mother and Kansan father who BOTH sang this to me. We moved away from Texas when I was 18 months old and lived around the country until I was graduated from HS and we returned to Texas::: and I've been here ever since. (In fact::: as a kindergartner in Pennsylvania::: I was shocked to learn that the song had other lyrics.)
MA and ABD in French Lit from UT::: and I still sing ""The Eyes of Texas"" with horns up whenever I hear it. And I always will. If it was good enough for Lady Bird Johnson's funeral::: it will be good enough for mine.
🤘🤘🤘",“The Eyes of Texas is our alma mater and will remain so”? If that is how you begin the discussion::: why would anyone want to share their story? I am very proud of my BS in Mechanical Engineering from UT Austin in 1983 and I am a Texas Exes Life Member. The school song has nothing to do with my pride in graduating from UT::: and if it takes changing the tune and lyrics to make the song more compatible with the BLM movement - I am all for it. Either way::: I personally choose to support BLM and will never sing along to ‘The Eyes of Texas’ again. 🤘🏼,All these people with this victim mentality talking about what hurts their feelings or about a SONG causing them harm. Obviously they have never experienced REAL racism. As a white person I will tell you racism by blacks against whites is REAL! As an 11 year old child I was terrorized::: bullied::: physically abused and threatened EVERY day in school just because I was an easy target-shy and white. It wasn’t just one person::: it was an entire group. And every day I had to find a different way to escape and run home so they couldn’t beat me up. It went on until my Mom moved us to another city where I didn’t have to be subjected to it anymore. So all this cancel culture and victim mentality carries no weight with me. I am fully aware of the hatred blacks have for whites but I don’t let it guide my life or get in the way of making the best of life. Everything in life is a choice. I choose to make the best of all opportunities available in this wonderful country. If you don’t like the song::: go to a different school where you feel less offended. But something tells me::: these people will find something to complain about NO MATTER WHAT. It’s just another form of bullying.....,"As an alumnus who blissfully celebrated my 50th reunion last Fall on campus::: I was stunned to learn the roots of this controversy regarding our school song. I'd never!!!! heard of its vague historical connections to racism. Am I alone in my bewilderment? I hope this controversy can be resolved without a loss of our beloved song. I do have an idea based on the assumption that ""The eyes"" is remotely linked to Lee. How about ""Lone Star of Texas shines upon us"" referencing our Lone Star state and flag?",The flute player at George Washington’s Mount Vernon likes the song! 🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻,"Aliexpress has prepared promo codes for Black Friday Fest :

"With a unanimous vote by the University of Texas System Board of Regents::: William C. Powers::: Jr.::: was named President Emeritus of The University of Texas at Austin on Thursday.

A beloved teacher::: a nationally recognized legal scholar::: and an advocate for top public research institutions::: Powers was the second-longest-serving president in UT Austin's history::: serving in that position from 2006 to 2015.

Known for his collegial relationships with students::: faculty::: philanthropists and elected officials::: Powers continued to teach until his death in March 2019.

“Bill Powers was higher education’s quintessential leader and his impact at UT Austin will be everlasting:::” Board of Regents Chairman Kevin P. Eltife said. “He set an ambitious goal to elevate an already-world class institution and never stopped pushing the bar higher::: no matter what UT Austin achieved.”

Powers' service at UT Austin spanned 40 years::: beginning when he joined the faculty of the School of Law in 1977. He became one of the nation's foremost experts on torts and served as dean of the law school for six years prior to becoming president.

As president::: one of Powers' greatest achievements was improving graduation rates. In 2011::: he set an ambitious goal to increase UT Austin’s four-year graduation rate from approximately 50 percent to nearly 70 percent. Today::: the four-year graduation rate is 72.2 percent.

NEWS.UTEXAS.EDU
University of Texas Support for Low-Income Students Increases Amid Economic Challenges of the Pandemic - UT News",2020-10-29 18:14:21,"“The pandemic has given us an opportunity to look deeply at ourselves as a nation and what is broken. Many Americans have given so much to help others in desperate straits. Still::: we must recognize that in spite of being one of the wealthiest and most educated countries in the world::: filled with some of the best scientific minds and medical facilities we have displayed our ugly underbellies to the world.

We are splintered politically with many people wanting to ring each others’ necks.

We have recorded more Covid-19 deaths than any country in the world.

Our healthcare system is an embarrassing bureaucratic disgrace compared to other developed countries. We pay much more for healthcare and have higher levels of uninsured yet call ourselves a caring::: compassionate nation.

Unlike most nations::: our downplaying of scientific medical advice has resulted in a fractured politicized response throughout the nation instead of a more effective nationwide patriotic coming together to combat the spread in a more uniform and strict manner.

Noted American violinist::: Samuel Thompson reiterated this incongruent reasoning in a recent observation:

""Let’s open the economy because coronavirus isn’t a threat but close the borders because coronavirus is a threat. Everyone got that?""

And in an ironic twist that displays how topsy turvy Americans have become::: many Pro-lifers think opening our economy back up is more important than health concerns::: while most Pro-choicers think health is more important than opening the economy back up.

Why do we accept the false dichotomy that the U.S. must choose between saving it’s economy or having fewer lives lost because of this pandemic? Can we not see that while there are well-intentione
d people on both sides of this hostile debate there is another avenue that we can choose to take as a nation that can both save our economy and continue to provide safeguards for our vulnerable populations.

In 2009 we bailed out major corporations with billions of dollars during the housing bubble::: junk bond and tech crash debacle. With the 2017 tax bill we gave huge tax breaks to corporations and the wealthiest segments of society. For decades we have subsidized many wealthy corporations with our tax dollars. And currently some major companies and lucky political donors received the lion’s share of the small business pandemic relief package at the expense of much smaller businesses.

We were promised that if the 2017 tax cut for corporations was approved they would not use their savings to buy back their own shares of stock. This proved to be a widespread lie. The stock buybacks resulted in higher stock prices resulting in greater pay packages for many wealthy CEOs whose pay is partially tied to the price of a share.

It’s drilled into us at a young age that corporations create jobs. That is true but we never were told that corporations depend on us employees to survive more so than we depend on an individual corporation to survive. In other words::: the billionaires need us workers and consumers more than we need them.

Furthermore we are lead to believe that these billionaire titans of society love America so much and are so grateful for us. Granted::: many do and many are charitable. Now though our economy is under a huge threat so let’s see all of them put their money where their mouths are. They can save this economy if only Americans and Congress are brave enough to say it’s time for you guys to bail us out this time if you truly love this country!

The richest 20 persons in America have a combined net worth of about 1 trillion dollars.

Considering that most religions and humanistic people tend to preach against the obscene hoarding of money::: why as a nation has this pandemic pitted many Americans against one another for the leftovers? Why do we think such a catastrophe won’t happen again and why in the world would we dare support politicians who oppose expanding our safety nets in advance of it happening again? But for right here and now::: why have we not had the creativity and hutzpah to demand that billionaires immediately pay a one-time tax levy that will help revive and restart our economy?

Again::: we have sacrificed over and over to save major corporations with tax breaks and bailouts::: but we are silent on a plan that will serve as a temporary safety net for most Americans and furthermore will reduce the clashes between those on the right::: left::: and middle who have been led to believe that our choices are only to save lives or to save the economy.

Specifically::: if every billionaire in the U.S. were levied a 15% tax on their net worth it would result in a check for more than $2:::200. for every person over 18 in our country! Imagine the stimulus from this additional check and how it would help stave off bankruptcy for millions as we safely reopen our economy.

Yes you can call it a Robin Hood scheme or a confiscation of money. Or we can choose to look at it as a form of eminent domain. In reality it is no different than the confiscation of most working class Americans’ tax dollars to save and subsidize corporate America in the past::: just a role reversal for a change.

Given time to consolidate or reorganize their holdings::: any prudent billionaire is not going to go broke by losing 15% of their wealth::: yet many Americans during this pandemic are being forced to go broke sacrificing anywhere from 20% to 90% of our incomes! We may be forced to lose our businesses::: our healthcare::: and our homes. None of these life sustaining necessities are threatened for a billionaire whose household income is roughly 1:::500 times the average American household income!

As the Reverend Dr. William Barber II said::: “The virus is teaching us that from now on living wages::: guaranteed healthcare for all::: unemployment and labor rights are not far left issues::: but issues of right vs wrong and life vs death.”

The average American worker has sacrificed for decades to make this country wealthy and strong. What is so wrong with the uber wealthy being asked to make a sacrifice in order to save our nation from catastrophic economic ruin and calm the rumblings of a civil war?”

Retired four-star Adm. William McRaven::: who led the U.S. Special Operations Command from 2011 to 2014::: endorsed former Vice President Joe Biden in an editorial published on Monday by The Wall Street Journal.

“This week I went to the polls in Texas:::” wrote McRaven::: who oversaw the raid that led to the 2011 death of terrorist leader Osama bin Laden. “Truth be told::: I am a pro-life::: pro-Second Amendment::: small-governmen
t::: strong-defense and a national-anthem
-standing conservative.”

He added:
“But::: I also believe that black lives matter::: that the Dreamers deserve a path to citizenship::: that diversity and inclusion are essential to our national success::: that education is the great equalizer::: that climate change is real and that the First Amendment is the cornerstone of our democracy. Most important::: I believe that America must lead in the world with courage::: conviction and a sense of honor and humility.”

Retired four-star Adm. William McRaven endorsed former Vice President Joe Biden in an editorial published on Monday by The Wall Street Journal. (ASSOCIATED PRESS)

THE STORIES THAT MATTER

Although McRaven didn’t mention President Donald Trump by name::: he delivered a cutting summary of what this presidency has done to the nation’s standing in the world.

“They have seen us tear up our treaties::: leave our allies on the battlefield and cozy up to despots and dictators:::“ McRaven wrote. “They have seen our incompetence in handling the pandemic and the wildfires. They have seen us struggle with social injustice.”

America::: he said::: is no longer looked to for leadership::: but that could change if Biden is elected.

McRaven has been a persistent critic throughout the Trump presidency. In 2018::: he called Trump’s attacks on the media “the greatest threat to our democracy in my lifetime.” And last year::: McRaven said the nation was under attack “not from without::: but from within.”","ah...yes...free

To somehow cancel the enormous pride all students and faculty (black::: brown::: or white) have experienced for over a hundred years singing the Eyes of Texas is an abomination....

Because::: the KKK used to wear sheets. If you are going to misalign a non-racist song because of where some people played it::: then be consistent and stop using sheets. At what point did they cease teaching people logic at UT? You must have a sorry band director. Any Director worth his salt would have kicked you all out of band by now.,One week? Ok,Sad! But not shocked!,John Zins,This is great::: but the bigger issue is the professors using their stage to push their own agenda!! This needs to STOP and if it is caught they should be terminated immediately!!,"Great first steps.

"This past July::: after hearing concerns from Black students and others and leading many heartfelt discussions with students::: alumni::: staff and faculty::: President Jay Hartzell announced a series of measures that we have already begun to implement. Although change takes time::: we are making meaningful progress.

Just last week::: we:
• approved the first $1 million in new funds to expand student recruitment and community engagement in Dallas::: Houston and the Rio Grande Valley to reach and support talented students from underrepresented communities;
• finalized signage that will appear on the Physics::: Math and Astronomy Building showing its change in name from RLM;
• launched a new diversity::: equity and inclusion website and a page where the community can track our progress (https://www.utexas.edu/about/diversity-equity-and-inclusion).

We understand and appreciate the deep passion surrounding our alma mater::: “The Eyes of Texas.” As we move forward and continue to perform and sing “The Eyes:::” it is critical that we understand the full history of the song::: share that history broadly and provide context around its meanings::: origins and roles during the past 120 years.

President Hartzell has asked Professor Richard Reddick::: a Texas Ex and Associate Dean for Equity::: Community Engagement and Outreach in the College of Education::: to chair a committee that will chronicle the full history of the “The Eyes” and recommend ways we can openly acknowledge::: share and learn from it. The committee will be composed of diverse alumni::: staff members::: faculty members and students::: including current or former athletes and Longhorn Band members::: and will draw upon the expertise of the many historians and higher education scholars here at UT.

Lazy job of parodying the song — not all the words were changed.
When I first heard it::: I immediately identified it and was very confused. It is not always performed with words::: and the majority of the world hearing that song immediately identifies it the way I do — as I’ve Been Working on the Railroad — because anyone not from The University of Texas will not recognize that some university chose it as their school song.
It’s not a very good song. The music school has some VERY talented composers who would come up with a significantly better school song. It is unfortunate that you are not using this as an opportunity to lead UT forward and come up with a decent dignified song::: instead of some babyish simplistic melody that was::: as you pointed out::: Mr. President::: deliberately selected over 120 years ago at the height of blackface minstrelsy and racism and slavery in the south and chosen to represent UT’s tradition::: for some reason...

-‘11 alum","I love the ""Eyes of Texas"" and The University of Texas at Austin. I'm a proud alumni.

I remember singing the song at my graduation::: football games::: the Rose Bowl::: and the like. It still brings about heartfelt nostalgia when I think about it::: singing the tune in my head.

Nevertheless::: I've been reading the comments on this thread all day::: and have watched in APALL and DISGUST as they've become more and more embarrassing to myself and the university at large. I felt I had to say something.

****

Before going further::: I'll say that I'm Indian-American
::: though I consider myself just ""American"" since I was born here and my parents/
grandparents lived almost their entire lives here. I think Indian-American
is a misnomer.

****

Those that don't think RACISM exists at UT-Austin live in a bubble. The Greek life is rife with it -\-\ just 5 years ago Fiji made the news for ""No Mexicans"" and ""No Interracial Dating"" rules. I saw a lot first hand as my roommates' fraternity had to have a ""vote"" to determine if they would give their first bid to a Black pledge -\-\ a vote which alumni drove in from all over the state to cast there ""NO's""... He was never given a bid. He rushed 3 years in a row.

Off-campus::: 6th Street was horrible. I was a pretty upper-middle-cl
ass kid from the burbs that was turned away from certain bars on ""dress code."" Apparently my Levi 501's (the slimmest you can buy) were ""too baggy."" This happened several times. Also several times I would be entering a bar with my White friends (most of my friends were) -\-\ and only I would get stopped at the door. The bouncers often thought I wasn't with them. They would only let me in after I explained I was. Not a one-time scenario.

On the other end of the spectrum... AFFIRMATIVE ACTION and Admissions. Americans with Asian background like myself are actually admitted LESS proportionately
than whites. Many schools actually PENALIZE us. This was something I used to be (and sometimes admittedly still am) frustrated with. But I realized later in life that I appreciated this. I had a few Black and Hispanic friends from VERY rough areas::: bad schools::: bad neighborhoods::: and didn't have even close to the same academic merits as me::: yet were going to school for a fraction of the price (I paid for nearly my entire education myself). I later realized that being friends with these folks benefitted me just as much as it might have benefitted them. Middle-class me had no idea what their lives were like -\-\ and they had no idea what mine was like. It gave us both exposure and we came together. (I still remember going back home with one friend from Houston and seeing bullet holes in his family's living room window. It wasn't even extraordinary to them)

Making friends like this while at UT has broadened my perspective -\-\ and that's education I can't put a price on.

*****

Racism does exist at and around UT-Austin::: but I'm happy to say I never experienced it myself by the University. I think the University is generally well-informed::: thoughtful::: and rational. I think they face a lot of conflicting pressures::: being a diverse::: top university in the historically segregated South. I think the measures here are a step in the right direction::: perhaps not even strong enough.

*****

This post is about RLM::: expanded recruitment::: and a new webpage. Yet people here have kneejerked it into affirmative action::: gender expression::: Joe Biden::: and most despicably... references to ""them."" Not an acknowledgment of ""us"" or our mutual goals::: just ""them"" and how ""they"" are the problem. And to follow that up with saying racism doesn't exist is just plain ignorance and hypocrisy. Not until you can acknowledge that ""they"" are students & alumni too::: can we all have a fair discussion about what it means to be a Longhorn.

****

And to those of you complaining about ""tradition""::: The Eyes of Texas has not been around forever. It was introduced randomly one day in 1903 and can change just the same. The reasoning of today (minstrel show roots) is as good as any to change it. The people that chose this song are not representative of the student body or alumni today. The song will always make my heart nostalgic for fond UT memories::: but there's nothing wrong with outgrowing something to become a better person and better community.

****

If you want blind tradition::: then you should go to A&M.",It all starts at birth to the young ppl - it ALWAYS has: ignorance and hate. Spread Tolerance and Love instead 😊.,Leave the Eyes of Texas alone! It was never racist! Ever intended to be racist!

- Adult me teaching this song and sharing my pride in MY university to my children
- Today me who nearly weeps every time it is played WITH my recently graduated daughter filled with pride that she is our family’s third generation Longhorns loving alumni

Yes::: that is what the “Eyes of Texas” means to me. You WILL NOT take it away from me based on what some- who do NOT love the traditions of UT- think. If people don’t want to sing it or play it::: don’t. Don’t come to UT to play or perform. Do not ruin traditions you don’t understand.

Check out the newly renovated Anna Hiss Gymnasium — the home of Texas Robotics and the hub for the university's partnership with Army Futures Command:,2020-10-02 21:03:52,"UT Austin President Jay Hartzell took a tour of the newly finished laboratory Friday with Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy and Gov. Greg Abbott.

The facility is one part of a larger partnership between UT Austin and the Army Futures Command that began during the spring of last year. The Futures Command::: headquartered in Austin::: designated UT as the hub for two of its five research programs: Robotics and Assured Positioning::: and Navigation and Timing::: which develops advanced location tools to help soldiers navigate contested environments.

The Army’s priorities for research include improving navigation systems in long-range artillery::: mobile communication networks and developing the next generation of vertical lift aircraft such as helicopters and drones.

“[The Army and The University of Texas] have a shared vision: to make UT one of the best robotic research facilities in the world with soldier-centere
d design at its core:::” McCarthy said. “The work that is being done here ultimately will save soldiers’ lives and help us achieve victory in combat.”

For people do not pick figs from thornbushes:::
nor do they gather grapes from brambles.

"Dear UT Community:::

I am reaching out today both to provide you with some updates on how the semester is unfolding so far and how we’re planning to approach the spring 2021 semester::: and also to ask for your help. Specifically::: we have an updated and streamlined process for Proactive Community Testing::: and we are asking that all in our community participate regularly in this excellent program — one that is critical for our understanding and for making adjustments as time goes on.

Before we turn to the testing program::: please know that I am grateful for all the adjustments you’ve made and all that you’ve done to help us get this far. Even while the presence of COVID-19 has shaped and influenced so many aspects of our lives in recent months::: we have been working to limit the spread of the disease::: keep our numbers as low as possible and provide an environment for learning::: research and instruction that is both safe and enriching. So far::: the results suggest that our health and safety efforts have been largely effective — the number of confirmed positive cases is within the range of what we had expected given UT’s size; there has been a relatively small number of infections among faculty and staff members; and the return of our student population has not resulted in wider spread throughout Austin and Travis County or increased hospitalizations. But there is much more work to be done.

We are continuing to partner directly with student organizations and property managers when we learn of community behavior that violates state and local orders. We are also coordinating closely with local officials as they enforce these rules. And we must all continue to be vigilant when it comes to wearing our masks::: social distancing::: getting flu shots::: completing UT’s mandatory COVID-19 training program::: monitoring our symptoms and getting tested regularly. The threat that COVID-19 presents is still very strong::: so it’s important to keep up the hard work even though it isn’t always comfortable or convenient.

Proactive Community Testing

As we have ramped up voluntary proactive community testing::: more cases have been identified::: which is what we expected and::: more importantly::: what can help us minimize spread and impact overall. It is critical that community members participate in our proactive community testing::: but I also acknowledge that there have been some kinks to work out during these early days::: and we are working hard to make changes. We want you to get tested regularly — as frequently as once every two weeks.

• Moving forward::: if you get tested through UT’s proactive community testing program and produce a positive result::: you will not have to take a second test for confirmation. Previously::: there were situations in which UT community members who tested positive for COVID-19 were required to get a second confirmatory test — that practice is over.

• The Protect Texas Together app is making it easier for you to get registered for proactive community testing. The app now allows you to consent and complete your symptom questionnaire on your phone or device. This will help you save time once you’re at a testing location so that you can get tested and back to your day quickly.

• We will soon be rolling out a new incentive program for UT community members who volunteer to get tested. Details will be announced in the coming days.

• As a reminder::: the university is working closely with Austin Public Health and health care providers throughout Austin and Travis County to fight COVID-19 in our community. We strongly encourage you to get your testing done on campus so that we can provide care and begin contact tracing immediately should you test positive. If you get a positive result at an off-campus testing center::: it is imperative that you report it to UT right away so there will be no delays in contact tracing. Students can self-report here: https://healthyhorns.utexas.edu/coronavirus_self_report.html. Faculty and staff members can self-report here: https://hr.utexas.edu/current/services/occupational-health-program. The results of an off-campus test will eventually be shared with UT by our partner organizations so that we can coordinate and conduct contact tracing::: but it is much safer and more efficient if we handle the testing and tracing on the Forty Acres from start to finish.

Spring Semester

As we near the midway point of the fall semester::: we are also starting to look ahead and plan for next year and beyond. Based on our experiences thus far::: our plan is to structure the spring 2021 semester in much the same way as we have the current semester. There will be robust online course offerings::: hybrid learning options and some purely in-person classes. Staff members who can work at a high level from home will continue to work from home. And we will ask students to quarantine in January prior to their return to campus.

The spring calendar will remain the same::: with spring break and other key events occurring at the same time they have in previous years. We have not yet determined what commencement will look like and how much of the celebration will be in person or online.

This is our general plan moving forward::: but as we all know::: much can happen in a few short months::: so we will continue to evaluate and make changes as necessary based on the latest public health guidance.

These kids sacrificed much of their Senior year in HS already. He sees people going to work...HIgh school students back to school::: etc. but he is a prisoner in his dorm room.

Thank you for protecting all of us from the spread and contraction of this awful illness.,This is ridiculous. Open up the campus.,"If not now then when? What data are we looking at to drive this?

Ever try a zoom discussion group where all the students had their faces hidden? Real productive. Fight Texas! The kids are::: now it's your turn.","I implore you to NOT offer spring semester in the same way as the current semester. I really can’t understand how classes that were pre-recorded in the spring are seen as a viable way to teach with zero professor interaction. I don’t believe ANY prerecorded class is “working at a high level from home."" The kids deserve better. There has to be a better way. If the decision was made to bring them on campus::: then why can’t they take most of courses in a classroom in person::: with masks 6 ft. part?

With masks and being socially distant this can easily be done. If you can have football games you can have in person classes. If we can go to the grocery stores and restaurants we can have in person classes. The virus is going to be here for a long time and the university needs to figure out a way to deal with it and put our students first. Their mental health is counting on it. Their future growth is counting on it. Schools in Austin (elementary and high school) are now opening up to those students that want to go back in person and UT can and should do the same. UT needs to open up! Please listen to the students and their families and give them the college experience that they have worked so hard for and so deserve.,Please be kind so our future has one,“Robust online course offering?”What a joke !!!,Cesar Gramer,My son will (hopefully)be doing all online for Spring 2021 and will look forward to Spring Break. Not to go party at the beach::: but to have a chance to sleep in and catch up on his classes. 🤞all his Spring classes will be online.,This is the WORST news possible. My transfer LHD has not been able to make connections with other LHs based on the fact everything on campus is basically closed::: along with no in-person classes and no roommate. She has spent more time at home instead of living in Austin in the dorms because being at school is more isolating. For the social and emotional well-being of our kids::: we need to open up the campus. If we can open up to make it to sporting events we can surely find a way to open up for academics. Looking at all the schools in the state who are K-12 and other Texas universities they have safeguards in place and are attending school in person each day. It is time! Plus::: thinking ahead::: graduation also needs to be a priority. Our kids work so hard to first make it to UT and then make amazing grades while studying they deserve to be celebrated!,"GWU Parents and GWU administrators:
While portions of this update could be in bullet points for clearer reading::: this is what frequent and transparent communication looks like for stakeholders.",Consider reducing tuition. The campus is running at reduced capacity. Pass those savings on to the students and their families.,Not at all happy about continuing the spring the semester with mostly on-line classes. Why can we have sporting events? Not all kids care about the sports. UT offers so much more that the kids are missing out on. Why can school districts go back but not colleges. We as parents spend a lot of money to send our kids to UT not to mention how hard the kids work to be accepted. Please rethink your position!!,"Same here

Yet continuing to plan a week long spring break to allow spread in Austin and other areas after student travel? I do not understand these decisions.,"Go back to school in person 100%. No one is learning squat online::: hybrid or otherwise. Covid doesn’t effect college aged kids. Covid doesn’t hardly effect healthy people.

Please return to sanity. My son’s a senior and you are prolonging this bs for what reason? All those degrees and professors and not a lick of sense 🤬","You should have seen the party at Limelight 31 at 107 E. 31st St on Saturday. Must have been 100+ kids drunk/

Like a stream is the king’s heart in the hand of the LORD;
wherever it pleases him::: he directs it.
All the ways of a man may be right in his own eyes:::
but it is the LORD who proves hearts.
To do what is right and just
is more acceptable to the LORD than sacrifice.
Haughty eyes and a proud heart–
the tillage of the wicked is sin.
The plans of the diligent are sure of profit:::
but all rash haste leads certainly to poverty.
Whoever makes a fortune by a lying tongue
is chasing a bubble over deadly snares.
The soul of the wicked man desires evil;
his neighbor finds no pity in his eyes.
When the arrogant man is punished::: the simple are the wiser;
when the wise man is instructed::: he gains knowledge.
The just man appraises the house of the wicked:
there is one who brings down the wicked to ruin.
He who shuts his ear to the cry of the poor
will himself also call and not be heard.",Proud to be a Longhorn! #hookem,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Having COVID for those that do not have another major health problem is like having Body Odor or having dirty hands. Go wash it off! You could be positive and then be negative and be positive again and negative 3 days later. If you are deathly afraid::: stay home.

We live in a world full of germs and God Help Us as millions of us and our immune systems is so low now due to lack of exercise::: lack of contact::: over sanitation and cleansing... The next wave of “super bug” will wipe us out! We are dirty animals and we get healthier and stronger the dirtier we become. This is why kids and young adults are not affected by COVID.

And some of these comments— re-think kindness my friends!,If you base your level of school spirit on the performance of one song then you never had school spirit. There are many qualities that comprise Longhorn spirit. Maybe look into the million other things the university does to make us proud Longhorns. Time to re-evaluate your knowledge about the strength and mettle of the entire Longhorn family and yes I am also talking about non-athletic programs too.,THE EYES OF Texas ARE UPON YOU....,Good win; sad times.,I missed the beginning David::: what did they do?,Playing with lives!

I’m not even rooting for those playing the Longhorns anymore.,Funny how Austin’s Liberal leadership has shut down music venues and restaurants because it’s so DANGEROUS and yet let thousands of people gather for this spectacle. Priorities priorities...,Yes::: I have an opinion about the song::: but you know what? As a white person who had every opportunity given to me::: my opinion doesn't matter.,Emily Malone Stevens,"It breaks my heart to admit it will tough to support the Longhorns if the players won’t respect the traditions the got them here in the first place! The Eyes of Texas is one of these traditions. Singing this song at the end of the game is their connection with the fans.

It’s time for adults in the room to grow a pair and remind these kids whose in charge!",Now big 12 play starts 26 so got to keep it up,"Was talking to a buddy about this yesterday. Favored by 44. If we win by 30 we under perform. If we win by 50 everyone will say “eh it’s UTEP”

Multiple big schools were beaten yesterday by “eh it’s...”

Offense looked fast. Loved that warp speed. Defense wasn’t challenged. That’ll be the real test. But I think we can score. Offense executed pretty well. Even if it was “eh it’s UTEP”

How about a little less brag until the meat of the season.,All the way to The Covid Bowl,It was UTEP. Calm down.,Preseason. Still::: a blow out is a blow out!

Great game boys!!,I never knew University of Texas played University of Texas... sounds like a lot of competitive tension.,I’ll like this because it’s positive.......,The LHB needed to be there. No reason not to have them there. 🤦‍♂️,Good start. Hopeful for a great season.,Too bad about the complete lack of school spirit shown by the team during “the eyes of Texas.” But they played well against a struggling team. Time will tell.

"We will never forget the attacks on 9/11 and all who were affected

📸 from September 2001",2020-09-11 13:44:06,Was feeding my 7 month old baby girl as I watch the Today Show in shock as they filmed the 2nd plane hit live. That little girl is now 2nd year at UT.,I was on campus 9/11/2001. I was a freshman. I was in Jester getting ready for my classes that day when I learned what was happening. I watched the world as I knew it change::: and I was glad to have such a strong community around me at that time. Never forget.,I was in class at UT that day,🧡🤍🤘🇺🇸,In my apartment on East Riverside brushing my teeth::: when I heard about the first plane from the TV in the living room. Figured the pilot had had a heart attack. Then the second plane. Realized it was no accident. Mind started racing and didn’t stop until I had driven home to East Texas the following weekend and could see my family.,"It’s amazing...less than 20 years ago::: we::: as a nation::: looked up to & respected first responders...po
lice::: firefighters::: EMS and others...as they showed their dedication to help::: protect & defend the citizens of our nation in response to the 911 terrorist attack. Now::: less than 20 years after that tragedy::: the left targets these very people that are still willing::: able & ready to defend the public!","I had just got out of my human ecology class walking over to my office at UHS. Walked in the SSB and noticed everyone I passed looked sad. I remember Julie Quinn Newton saw me and said ""Isn't this terrible""...and
I looked at her puzzling and said What? She told me that the WTC's had been attacked. Once in my office::: watching in horror::: my phone rang...my sister was calling from Dallas...and told me that her husband was in NYC for work and he was in tower 2. Then she told me that her daughter at GWU was on lockdown because of the Pentagon Dow the street had been hit too. Fortunately my brother in law got out before the tower fell and my niece was safe::: but I can never forget that day.",I will never forget where I was when I learned about it. Just left Jansen’s journalism class. In the middle of the quad between Littlefield::: Andrews::: Blanton and Carothers::: when I called back my mom and she said the Pentagon was hit. I stopped dead still and remember telling her::: “we are going to war”. Chilling now as it was then. I just hope we can find a way to come together again as a nation again.,That day::: I was pregnant with my first child. I cried all the way to work::: wondering what kind of world I was bringing a child into. Well::: today that baby is now 18 years old::: graduated high school in the middle of a pandemic::: and has been at her U.T. dorm for 3 weeks. There is tragedy::: there is heartache::: but little lives bloom into amazing flowers in the midst of it all. I remember those who perished 19 years ago::: and I remember the heroes who ran straight in::: to save whoever they could.,I surely remember this scene. What a moving tribute.,I was three months pregnant then with now my freshman LHD💛💙❤️,"Staged attack to justify American oil/regime change wars abroad.

We didn't have a TV that was set up to see this::: but soon a tech teacher came to my room and set it up. Just before the second attack. I asked my students to pray for our nation. All bowed their heads and prayed. I also said ""I know that there are many faiths represented in this room"" but right now we all need to pray. You could have heard a pin drop in the room. All were so respectful and quiet. I will never forget nor be more proud of how my muli ethnic::: multi racial group of teens reacted. There was unity in the class! These teens are in their upper 30's now.",Im from NY and was 6 years old. My family and I were on another flight to go to Florida that day. They canceled and we had to get off the plane and go home,I was expecting my freshman who is in UT this year.,"On the bus heading home from my 8am class...

In July::: we shared our plans to create a more diverse and welcoming campus. Today::: we took the first step with the renaming of the Robert L. Moore Building as the Physics::: Math and Astronomy Building. Permanent signage will be displayed soon.,2020-08-21 00:25:01,I see nothing wrong or offensive with removing Robert Lee Moore's name. It is all a matter of who we would like to honor henceforth. We are shaping our environment::: our culture::: and our home to be more beautiful and welcoming places. 🥰,PAM (Physics::: Astronomy::: and Math),So you're okay with one of your professors promoting pedophilia::: but Robert E. Lee's name has to go. Got it.,"Fond memories of RLM hall back in 1997::: had Bio 302 and Algebra there. Would always stop by the egg roll cart for their $1.50 fried rice. Good stuff::: wonder if they are still there.

No opinion on name changing as I believe::: as others have mentioned::: the open ended name also allows for a large donor to step in for naming rights (I remember the CBA and the bidding between McCombs and Hicks) .

However::: we may be going down a slippery slope. What's next::: will New York change their name since it's named after the House of York that shipped over 90:::000 slaves to the US?",Is Thomas Hubbard still a professor there? I dare say he is a more dangerous person,Ahhhh::: the place where pedophiles are employed. I will definitely be suggesting to my friends that are looking for colleges::: that they avoid this place.,I walked into Robert Lee Moore Hall hundreds of times and never noticed the name. Far more important things to consider than the name of a building. Of course::: I wasn't part of the woke segment of the student body . . . the ones protesting for changes that have zero impact. And the cowards in the administration bend over backwards to appease them. At least now I know the name of the building that caused many sleepless nights!,That's what it was called when I was a coed on campus in the 70s,"Ah yes::: good ol RLM. Where the locks missing on the bathroom stalls means you get to make eye contact with everyone who walks into the bathroom!

Glad it was renamed::: now it just needs a facelift. Good on you::: UT. Eyes forward::: horns up. Hook em.",Glad they changed the name 🤘 - still the worst building on campus 😂,"I’m just mad about the latest tuition hike!

So glad those dumb jocks on the football team decided to blackmail the University to force such ""important"" changes.

Will they be defunding the UT police next? 🤣",What are we going to do about the song?,Funny how things come back around. It was called PMA when I began my BS in EE in 1973 and it was RLM when I returned to school in 1984. I never got used to the new name.,This is a great step! Our beautiful campus does not need to honor people who don’t align with values of love and respect. Keep making positive change::: Texas!,It was long overdue!,"I have found my people!! I graduated in 1985 and all my friends and family know I despise RLM.
I wouldn’t even use the ATM there!!
I am happy they have changed the name but I still won’t be stopping in for the bathroom OR the ATM.",If nothing else::: it frees up a building to be named after a very::: very generous alumnus.,PMA - Pain in My A$$. Though I had astronomy lab there that was fun. Gone back to its original name. No big deal.,Is it just me or were the escalators to the classrooms the fastest you’ve ever seen - late ‘80s,Ural Wade. Thankyou for you.,Awesome! Hook’em Horns!,What did RLM do that was racist::: just curious?,Ridiculous. Keep on whitewashing away history. Oh wait is that phrase politically incorrect also? 🤣,But did they fix the floor numbering. 4th floor being the first floor :),And just what exactly does this accomplish. Nothing. Its criminal justice system reform that is needed. Not symbolic nothings.,They finally did it 🎉🎉🎉🎉,My very first class at 8 am MWF was in RLM in the Fall of 1988.,Suggest you just number all the buildings and remove any chance that future generations will find any objections.,"So what is the PMA building called now?🤔

Oh::: we’ve come full circle PMA - RLM - PMA.

Bad memories of that building — my shoelace got caught on the escalator as I stepped off. Thank goodness for Bobby Stevens who reached down and pulled it out in one swift motion. Whew.

Those were fast::: crowded escalators.","While you’re at it::: the Californians probably want you to do away with the Longhorn too.
You know::: BEVO probably feels oppressed.",I will always remember it as RLM and it’s famous 13th floor,Recognize the opportunity we have to understand our own complicity in perpetuating racism::: and act on it! Yes::: Longhorns! Cut out that Cancer::: and make the world a little better! Because: What Happens Here Changes The World. Proud Longhorn here::: Hook ‘Em Horns!,This is just giving on to the hysteria!,Always thought it should be MAP.,Because PMA makes more sense::: since those classes were a pain in my A$$. 😂,What a lame name. Why not pick a new namesake?,Dang. Wish you would have named it the Physics::: Astronomy and Math Building and called it PAM. 😂,Some of us protested when the name was changed from PMA to RLM years ago. We tried to explain Moore’s racism::: but we were ignored.,So brave and stunning. 🙄,Proud of my University for embracing positive change!,Go back to California.,Bend the Knee UT,Anthony Gonzales,I’ll never understand why my fellow white people are so resistant to removing the name of a racist from a building.,"Home of the child raping professors...
Fire Thomas Hubbard::: or you are an accessory to child molestation!!!",greattt,Got to unfollow this PC stuff,Succumbing to the threats of children!!!,"So drawing attention to the name Robert Lee Moore by posting this sign is supposed to make things better?

Also not my favorite building when at was at UT.","When do you plan to rename the Lyndon Johnson School of Public Affairs?

"Dear UT Community:::

We’re just a week away from the start of classes::: and we want to update you on additional plans and resources for the fall semester and some of the efforts we’re making to keep our students::: staff and faculty safe.

Our decisions about returning to campus in hybrid mode this fall have been driven by the health needs and concerns of our entire community::: and we want to assure you we will maintain our focus on that priority throughout the semester. In recent days::: we have closely followed the experiences and strategies of other colleges and universities across the country::: including peer institutions that have struggled with COVID-19 cases such as the University of North Carolina and the University of Notre Dame. Our university is learning from them and strengthening our understanding of what it takes for a community to mitigate the effects of a virus that can::: if unchecked::: spread rapidly — we hope that you are as well. We believe our students and other community members can respond to these stories by behaving responsibly and protecting each other::: enabling us to continue to have safe in-person experiences on campus this fall.

That said::: it’s important to note that while we are providing a blend of course delivery formats to our students::: many students have chosen to learn fully online this fall. 76% of the seats taken this semester will be for courses that are completely online::: another 19% are for hybrid classes that combine online elements with in-person elements and only about 5% are fully in person. There will be far fewer students::: staff and faculty on campus than normal::: and those who are here will be expected to wear masks and maintain social distancing requirements and encouraged to sign the Commitment to Protect Texas Together: https://utexas.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3O5JDgd5O2vgY7z

Just as important::: our health::: academic and occupational health experts will continually monitor patterns of COVID-19 infections in the university community::: conduct root cause analyses for clusters that will emerge among students::: staff and faculty and make recommendations about changes in safety protocols::: enforcement::: messaging and education. Working with university leaders::: I will put those recommendations into action and approve any significant policy adjustments that are needed throughout the semester.

Below are some other important announcements that will help you plan for the fall semester.

Protect Texas Together App
Today::: we officially released the Protect Texas Together App for students::: faculty and staff. The app is available to download here: https://protect.utexas.edu/app/. It is designed to help individuals track their symptoms each day and — based on those symptoms — indicate whether they are cleared to come to campus. Downloading and using the app::: while strongly encouraged::: is completely voluntary. The app was developed by UT students and employees for UT students and employees::: with a strong focus on protecting privacy.

Classroom and Campus Safety Preparation
We have been preparing classrooms for the semester by blocking off::: zip-tying and stickering seats to accommodate for socially distanced learning. Additionally::: UT staff members have been installing approximately 3:::000 hand sanitizing stations::: numerous plexiglass shields and informational signage across campus to accommodate the health and safety needs of students::: faculty and staff. The goal is to have over 100 campus buildings certified and prepared for in-person learning by this Friday::: August 21.

COVID-19 Training
To support a healthy return to the Forty Acres::: we are requiring that all students::: faculty and staff complete an online::: interactive training program called ""Staying Healthy in a Changing Environment."" This training will provide helpful information for navigating the presence of COVID-19 during the fall semester::: protecting your physical health and the health of fellow Longhorns::: while maintaining your mental well-being. You will receive a personalized email during the coming days with information about how to access the training.

#HookEm | #MyTexas",2020-08-12 16:11:48,You're going to kill people lol. Hook em!,Or... could you not? I live a mile from the stadium and it sounds like a pretty bad idea to have fans in the stands.,One thing we can thank libtards for is now we don’t have to hear the eyes of Texas are upon you 🤣.,Texas Fight!,We will see what happens. COVID needs to be a team on this list.,With a recovery rate of 99.96% this is the right decision! Don’t be a fool and live your life!,Pause for a year and give seniors another year of eligibility.,Hook ‘Em Horns!,Don't send these young men home. Sending them back to neighborhoods they're trying to get away from. Some of these kids grew up and may have been in horrible situations you couldn't imagine. They need football a lot more than we do.,It’s all about the money. How very sad.,So glad my tuition is going towards efforts to further endanger my health so others can profit,It's all money! They don't care about the players.,YES!!! Let’s get it on!!! My only issue is we don’t get to spank LSU! 🤘🏼🤘🏼🤘🏼,"I say play on! I loved what Coach Saban said which was the kids have less a chance getting it running around at practice and having the coaching staff monitor them than running around town with friends.

Someone said ""just not play and save the eligibility for next year like Sam and other Sr's"". Those players may want to start their NFL career or life....we can't say ""no guys::: you have to stay another year to play."" Uhhhh No!",Love it! Best decision that I have read on this feed in months.,Hook ‘EM \\m/ so happy for this and the athletes.,I am totally thrilled about this::: don’t like stay put in your cave you PUSS,"Ugh. Well if fans will be present::: then at least close the alumni center and other close::: indoor gathering spaces; require masks in the inside parts of stadium; and play all games during the sunniest part of the day.

Also::: somehow::: discourage screaming.","Why don’t you call the games a protest against policy that discriminated against players rights to the NFL and economic freedom . Seems a repressive policy let the players decide .
Would you deny those players that right .","I’m utterly pissed off at this decision.

Let’s give the real facts to why the B12 is going on with their season:
The B12 has made utterly moronic decisions over the last few years and weakened its posture within the Power 5. By electing to play this season::: they are trying to “build” the brand after already tarnishing it these last few years. You are putting people in danger from your own short sightedness and stupid behavior.

We are SERIOUSLY going to burn eligibility for some of our star players (like Sam Ehlinger) to play a season of glorified scrimmage games. No national championship is being played this year. We could go undefeated and we’ll have a * next to this season (This season means nothing). So inevitably when the other conferences “skip” the season::: keep their eligibility::: and bring in new blood::: we’ll be back to being mediocre as a conference next year. Great job B12...

The B12 is such shortsighted when it comes to football recruitment and public health it’s laughable.",Hook ‘em. And go Astros. Only sports I watch these days. Too much politics in the others.,Throw the huskers in there,Athletes being healthy and working out... Fairly sure that keeps their immune system working too... It's like being active and healthy helps keep sicknesses at Bay.,Be safe and play ball.,Very::: very disappointed with this decision.,Great idea 40 acres! What could possibly go wrong...,Maybe UT should ask their science department instead of the athletic department whether or not this is a good idea.,This virus destroys the lungs . These young athletes depend on their lungs more than any other part of their body . Let go of the greed and use our heads . Listen to the healthcare officials . Not the talking heads .,Public health disaster::: here we come!! Buckle up folks.,Hook Em!!! So excited for football to come back!!,Any word on max attendance at these games? Are they limiting attendance to allow greater separation?,Don't do it!! After all if you get this virus you only have a 98.7 percent chance of surviving it!!!,Hook 'em!!! For all those against playing the season::: mind your own. If the student athletes dont want to play::: if the coaches dont want to coach::: they dont have to. If they want to::: its their decision::: not yours.,With a 97-99 percent recovery rate::: I’m happy we will still have Longhorn football!,Big 12::: you're going to kill a lot of people::: and maim many more.,"Why do we need to continue to shut the world down and continue to increase suicide rates and mental health when we have treatment.

"Thousands of UT faculty and staff members are hard at work preparing for the start of the fall semester. Many students are beginning to return to Austin for on-campus learning::: while many others are setting up for immersive remote learning at home. As a community::: we are gearing up for another semester of exceptional educational experiences — regardless of format — which means life-changing classes and teaching::: visionary creative opportunities::: innovative research and scholarship::: and so much more.

We currently project that 45% to 50% of undergraduate students have chosen to take all of their courses online in the fall. Over 60% of UT faculty members will teach online-only this semester::: and there will also continue to be a dramatically reduced number of staff members on campus as those who can continue to perform at a high level from home will continue to do so. Further::: there will be substantial reductions in the numbers of students living in on-campus housing during the upcoming semester. Given the current state of COVID-19 in Texas and its future unpredictability::: this broad reduction in population density will help us stay safe::: maintain social distance and limit spread on the Forty Acres during the months to come.

"Today we are sharing the university’s comprehensive testing strategy for COVID-19 during the fall semester::: which is only a few weeks away. Robust and rigorous testing will be needed to monitor and limit the presence of COVID-19 on our campus and keep our community members as safe as possible as we continue to navigate the pandemic. Here are some of the key elements of our strategy:

• We have a goal of proactively testing up to 5:::000 UT community members each week for COVID-19 using a strategic::: scientific-based approach.

• We will rely heavily on our in-house testing capabilities::: leveraging the world-class expertise of UT faculty and staff members from across the university. By developing our capacity in house::: we are shielded — to a substantial degree — from fluctuations in demand that can limit the available capacity of commercial labs serving the broader community.

• We will have the capacity to test hundreds of symptomatic students each day using in-house labs. Additionally::: we have ordered three rapid testing machines that will allow for approximately 100 tests per day with a 15-minute turnaround time for results.

Participation in all COVID-19 testing and contact tracing is completely voluntary::: but we strongly encourage our community members to use these services as needed.

Working in collaboration with epidemiologists::: infectious disease experts and other health care professionals::: our strategic approach to COVID-19 testing consists of three components: testing for individuals who are ill::: contact tracing and proactive community testing.

"As we plan and prepare for the fall::: the university is continuing to closely monitor the spread of COVID-19 in Austin::: throughout Texas and across the country. Below::: you will find a few important policy updates and announcements related to COVID-19.

Students Self-Quarantine Prior to Campus Arrival

In order to help prevent COVID-19 infections on our campus and in our local Austin community::: we are requesting that students self-quarantine for 14 days prior to arrival in Austin.

To effectively self-quarantine::: please stay in your home and limit in-person interactions as much as possible throughout the two-week period — you can learn more about how to self-quarantine here: https://healthyhorns.utexas.edu/images/pdf/COVID-19_Self_Quarantine_Guidance.pdf. If quarantining at home is not possible::: then please quarantine for up to 14 days before your first on-campus activity once you arrive in Austin. If you are already in Austin::: you should quarantine in your Austin residence for 14 days prior to the start of classes or your first on-campus activity. We know that everyone’s situation is different; please make self-quarantine plans in a manner that makes sense for you.

We are relying on all students to take very seriously the responsibility of preventing the spread of COVID-19::: and self-quarantining is a critical first step.

Protect Texas Together App

We continue to make progress on the development of the Protect Texas Together app for students::: faculty and staff that will help individuals track their symptoms each day and — based on those symptoms — indicate whether they are cleared to come to campus. The app is being designed with privacy in mind. Members of the UT research community have been voluntarily using the beta version of the app to help us learn and troubleshoot so that we can make it as effective as possible. The plan is to officially launch the app in mid-August

Here’s some information about how the Protect Texas Together app will work:

• Users can track their symptoms each day::: and the app can provide a daily campus pass for those without any major COVID-19 symptoms.

• If the app’s algorithm determines that an individual may have COVID-19 based on the symptoms that person selected::: the app will decline to provide a pass and instead direct the user to either University Health Services or UT Health Austin for guidance or testing. Faculty and staff members can also go to the provider of their choice.

• The app will also allow users to note their location when they enter or exit any campus room or office. For those using the app::: this can replace filling out a room’s paper sign-in sheet and help keep an accurate log of campus activity so the university can quickly identify spaces that might need to be decontaminated or closed if someone later tests positive for COVID-19.

• There will be app-specific QR codes posted outside many campus buildings. If your room has a QR code::: you can quickly scan that instead of manually entering your room number into the app.

Additionally::: ITS is developing a call-based app to accommodate users who do not have smartphones or computer access.

Face Mask Enforcement

As a reminder::: it is required that UT community members and visitors wear recommended protective face masks at all times when inside university owned and controlled buildings except:

• When alone in a private office.

• For students::: when alone — or with a roommate — in an assigned residence hall room.

• When eating and drinking while practicing social distancing — including in a campus dining facility.

• When an alternative has been approved as part of the Americans with Disabilities Act or religious observance accommodation processes.

We encourage community members to wear recommended protective face masks outdoors.

UT will encourage compliance by increasing awareness and fostering a spirit of cooperation. For those who continue putting the community at risk with their behavior::: corrective::: disciplinary and enforcement action may be taken in accordance with the university’s guidelines for faculty::: staff and students.

Students who refuse to follow directives to wear a mask — and force class to be canceled with this refusal — will be referred to Student Conduct and Academic Integrity in the Office of the Dean of Students for disciplinary action. Repeat violations will lead to sanctions including suspension from campus.

Crowd Size at Longhorn Football Games

As we’ve planned for the fall semester::: one of the common questions we’ve heard from our community is: How do we expect our athletic events::: and football in particular::: to take place? We have been exploring a range of scenarios surrounding crowd attendance for upcoming football games at DKR-Texas Memorial Stadium::: with a maximum occupancy of up to 50% of crowd capacity.

Kevin Eltife::: Chairman of the UT System Board of Regents::: has requested that the university continue to review its policies and specifically explore the logistics::: health and safety effects of crowds at 25% of capacity (including students).

The analysis of this new crowd size target is a reflection of the consistent change and uncertainty that has come with the COVID-19 pandemic. As rates in Austin and throughout Texas continue to ebb and flow::: we must be agile and work consistently to develop strategies to protect the safety of our student athletes::: coaches::: staff members::: students and all who visit our campus for athletic events. As we approach the start of the football season::: we will closely monitor the spread of COVID-19 and make final decisions based on the guidance of our Board of Regents and state health officials in the coming weeks.

• Adopting a university-wide plan to recruit::: develop and retain world-class faculty members who bring more diversity to our research and teaching missions

• Renaming the Robert L. Moore Building as the Physics::: Math and Astronomy Building

• Honoring Heman M. Sweatt by creating the Heman M. Sweatt Entrance to T.S. Painter Hall::: placing a statue of Sweatt near the entrance::: and rededicating a space in the building to recognize Mr. Sweatt’s courage and leadership in changing the world through the 1950 case that he won

ffIpRC9cSUc",Assume that all of the new names have been vetted for any past history of racism::: misogyny::: or illegal activity ( such as drug use or the like)::: right?,Johnny Willey,"The University of Texas at Austin

Repost from another black alumni;

tl;dr: The University of Texas’ statement was insulting at best::: sinister at worst—changes here and there::: but holding on to the final vestiges of the Confederacy with the tightest of grips.

It's clearly evident that the University of Texas spent the past 30 days working to develop a plan that will please certain alumni::: while subtly pacifying the concerns of many in its minority community. The issues raised in a letter penned by student-athlete
s in June were not new::: but rather included an ultimatum that the administration (and the greater public) could not simply ignore.

That being said::: here are the action/
inaction items that for the life of me I cannot understand:

o 𝐒𝐭𝐮𝐝𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐬’ 𝐑𝐞𝐪𝐮𝐞𝐬𝐭: rename Robert Lee Moore Hall (racist/
segregationist professor)
• 𝐔𝐓'𝐬 𝐑𝐞𝐬𝐩𝐨𝐧𝐬𝐞: building renamed; however::: some sort of plaque/exhibit will be erected within the same building to explain why it was once named after professor Robert Lee Moore.

Why the need for this ""historical explanation""… I'll leave that up to your imagination.

o 𝐒𝐭𝐮𝐝𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐬’ 𝐑𝐞𝐪𝐮𝐞𝐬𝐭: rename T.S. Painter Hall (racist/
segregationist UT President)
• 𝐔𝐓'𝐬 𝐑𝐞𝐬𝐩𝐨𝐧𝐬𝐞: building not renamed; rather than renaming the building::: the University of Texas has taken the odd approach of naming an “entrance” to a building. Specifically::: the entrance to Painter Hall::: which is named after racist past UT President T.S. Painter::: will be renamed after Heman M. Sweatt::: the black student Painter denied admission because…he was black.

o 𝐒𝐭𝐮𝐝𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐬’ 𝐑𝐞𝐪𝐮𝐞𝐬𝐭: rename Littlefield Residence Hall (slave owning Confederate)
• 𝐔𝐓'𝐬 𝐑𝐞𝐬𝐩𝐨𝐧𝐬𝐞: building not renamed; rather than renaming the residence hall::: the University will take somewhat of a contradictory approach—“educa
te our community and visitors” about Littlefield.

o 𝐒𝐭𝐮𝐝𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐬’ 𝐑𝐞𝐪𝐮𝐞𝐬𝐭: rename James Hogg Auditorium (racist/
segregationist Governor of Texas)
• 𝐔𝐓'𝐬 𝐑𝐞𝐬𝐩𝐨𝐧𝐬𝐞: building not renamed; similar to their approach with slave owning Confederate Littlefield::: the University will take the odd approach to “educate our community and visitors” about Hogg.

o 𝐒𝐭𝐮𝐝𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐬’ 𝐑𝐞𝐪𝐮𝐞𝐬𝐭: retire the Eyes of Texas (racist minstrel show anthem)
• 𝐔𝐓'𝐬 𝐑𝐞𝐬𝐩𝐨𝐧𝐬𝐞: yes song is racist::: it will not be retired::: but instead “reclaimed” and “redefined”; this one was a bit tougher for the University to spin…they failed and showed their racist colors...Burnt Orange for those keeping score.

It’s akin to white folks “reclaiming” and “redefining” the “n” word. #itdontworkliket
hat

Finally::: the University of Texas prides itself as being Texas' leading research university. So you would assume over the past few weeks::: they would have exercised some semblance of due diligence in researching other racist symbols on campus. No::: they didn't.

I conducted just a cursory search of the campus buildings and found the following symbols of hate that were left unaddressed by the University's statement (non-exhaustive
list):

• Belo Center for New Media—named after Confederate Alfred Horatio Belo
• Caven-Clark Field—named after Confederate James Benjamin Clark
• Roberts Hall—named after Confederate Oran Milo Roberts
• Littlefield Carriage House—named after Confederate George Washington Littlefield
• Littlefield Fountain—named after Confederate George Washington Littlefield
• Littlefield Home—named after Confederate George Washington Littlefield
• Littlefield Patio Cafe—named after Confederate George Washington Littlefield

As an African-America
n alum::: I'm curious who the president and his team conversed with in making this decision? Which ""scores of students"" did he speak with that would endorse the decisions referenced above? I wonder which of them would agree with continuing to take classes in buildings named after segregationist:::
or live in a residence hall named after a Confederate? Which students would agree to sing a racist anthem that is a remix to a Robert E. Lee single::: a racist anthem that was performed by the Texas Cowboys at minstrel shows::: a racist anthem that serves as one of the final vestiges of the Confederacy?

The University's statement was insulting at best::: sinister at worst.","🖕🖕 your college.

Harvard::: MIT have no reason to reduce the chance of black students to get good educations but train Chinese students from China to against Taiwanese and Americans. It's reasonable to let International students to go back their countries. Bachelors' degrees should give to more black students not students from China. US government helps China to train Chinese students to threaten Taiwan and USA. It's stupid for UC trying to reduce the admission of 10:::000 Asia Americans.

Then about Senti Becker's being raped at Main Jail in San Jose by cops and about Samsung VP's Wife Charlene Lee's being jailed for one year by ugly Judges at Hall of Corruption in San Jose at 190 West Hedding Street::: San Jose::: CA95113. How are these wives of billionaires keep silent? Let UCLA and UC Berkley can compete with Yale University and Harvard University. I oppose to use race and sexes to select students of UC. We need to reduce the admission of International students. I oppose ACA 5 or Proposal 16. ACA5 will reduce 10:::000 Asia Americans to get admission to UC Systems. UC should not let China people to enter UC to study in the United States. We need to take care of Black people first not help China to train Chinese to study in UC. US has worst cops in the wholewide world. Ugly Judges have long terms on purpose jail innocent people. We should have one State Hospital to lock these Ugly Judges and have four of other State Hospitals to arrange these poor Homeless to live in the facilities of State Hospital.

s to help in raising money from billionares to build some Homeless Camps and/or build Homeless Houses or Homeless City to take care of Homeless in streets across the United States due to some Judges' corruption. Defund all governors who assigned ugly judges to us and who can not resolve Homeless problems.
Defund all mayors in the United States to put Homeless in the streets. Defund the Judges. Defund UC President and UCSB Chancellor Henry Yang and all Chancellor Members of UC Santa Barbara. Court Psychologist of Hall of Justice in San Jose California Robert Prez stated Samsung VP's wife Charlene Lee immigrated to USA in 1991 and I received Yale Bachelor in 1993. Judge Javier Acala and Judge Michele Macay Macoy have long terms conspired with Court Doctors to fabricate stories in Court Evaluation Reports and help these lying Court Psychologists to fraud Court Report Fee. We have written to many Presidents including South Korea::: Taiwan::: President Donald Trump and United Nation Human Right Office to accuse these US Judges pretend can not read English in Court and use Covid 19 to reject to have defendants to show up in Court. These corrupt judges::: DAs. Public Defenders::: cops and Jail Staffs have made a lot of Homeless across the United States. US governors assign many judges with serious mental illnesses to us. Judge Michele Macay Macoy has been sued by a woman for depriving her Civil Rights and violation of Undue proess but Judge Michele Macay Macoy and Judge Javier Acala insisted on using Court Psycologists Ashley Cohen::: Rami::: and Robert Prez Reports. These judges should be investigated and put into jails. How much do we need to pay for make Wolfe Road of Cupertino City to be clean and safe? Judge Evette Pennypacker assigned by former Governor Newson has involved in falisfing Court record of Nov 22::: 2019. Falisfying Court Record is a crime. City of Cupertino::: City Manager Debro Feng and Mayor Steve Scharff respond to this question. What is the reason to put a lot of homeless into Wolfe Street? Why did previous governor assigned Judge Javier Acala to us? Judge Javier Acala can not read English at all. District Attorney Johnny Gogo can not provide any evidence about jailing Samsung VP's wife for one year. Why did Governor Newson assigned the worst DA Johnny Gogo to be Judge Johnny Gogo? I did not see any homeless in City of Glendale and City of Burbank. I would like to ask Mayor of Cupertino Steve Scharff and Mayor of San Jose. Why do two mayors put so many homeless into street of Cupertino and Street of San Jose ? US Judges have long terms conspired with Court Psychologists::: District Attorneys::: Public Defenders::: Lawyers to cheat and fraud in Court. These Judges are most serious issues. We need to take our Judges' immunity. US Judges allege they can not read English and are unable to read any Court reports. These Judges are racists and need to be investigate and put them into jails. We need to recall more judges and defund the Judges. Many judges in the United States are incompetent and should be lock in jails or State Hospitals. Judges of Hall of Justice have long term have serious racial injustice. I will run for City Council of Cupertino on Nov 3rd::: 2020.

..From khalifa of Allah over the worlds to Xi Jinping president of China
🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳...

Allah’s hidden soldiers are still launching their global war continuing night and day for twenty-four hours without rest::: and it does not get weak::: surely it is from His hidden soldiers::: unseen with the naked eye for its small size::: and it's what you call it coronavirus::: yet it is not a corona::: only has deceived them initially the outer form has similarity with the known viruses that they have previously of which they know::: but it’s genes and its behavior is different altogether::: but its first name corona as they thought initially is being issued in the entire means of media and by the tongues (languages) of the world; [Corona] although it is completely different than the entire viruses::: and only got similar with it formerly initially yet it differed genetically. In fact; by Allah Who there is no God other than Him::: the One::: the Subduer::: indeed it is a living organism broken apart and been split::: yet what’s coming next is calamitous::: most bitter and a wide spread evil::: and the entire physicians of humans will turn their backs (fleeing).

And it is a living organism new for humans and breaking the entire scientific medical physics::: and it will indeed make humans’ science about what concerns scientific medical physics (0) zero at the left for the fact they originally do not compass knowledge about it.

But the upcoming strong virus is the most powerful and the strongest impact in chastisement lo and behold they will despair from it::: and it is not only at the level of the respiratory system::: in fact there is no room for a comparison between covid 19 viruses and the upcoming strong virus — O Xi Jinping president of China — O who claim that they controlled chastisement of Allah Lord of the world::: glory be to Him the Exalted most High beyond measure::: yet they know that they are indeed liars

I announce to the atheists in china and criminal leaders of humans of their ilk altogether::: and the entire unjust mischief makers::: — a new species of viruses which is the strong striking virus worst of the viruses and the most impact and the strongest in sabotaging; in fact there is no room for a comparison between it and what you call it covid 19::: it is the one that the scientists of medicine will turn their backs in flight from it and the army of physicians of humans would not return back::: being defeated from their forefathers then the global health organization would collapse their high structure is being vacant and they could never avail a thing away from you from Allah’s chastisement. In fact::: by no means and they could never be able to help you nor help themselves.

Verily::: listen::: comprehend and understand to what I will say to you: Indeed::: there is a Great Leader for these recent viruses you are not of His proportion nor you are equivalent to Him and His tiniest soldiers receive orders directly by revelations from Allah::: so they would do what they are commanded from source of operations for the Highest Leader::: that is your Most High Lord in the kingdom — reveals directly to His tiny soldiers what to do so they would do what they are commanded and He is with it by words of His absolute-abilit
y — glory be to him::: that is Allah Lord of the worlds that you violate His sanctity (denying His existence) — O Xi Jinping the Chinese president who declared war against Allah::: His religion::: His Quran and the Muslim Chinese openly (in broad) daylight against the Muslims in China and shut-down Allah’s Houses (of worship) in China. In fact::: he prohibited the Muslims to even pray in their houses and took Allah’s Book the grand Quran and burned Allah’s Book the grand Quran as transgression and oppression.

You must listen and comprehend what will I say it with Truth: O you the Chinese president Xi Jinping::: I swear by Allah the Great::: surely you will open houses of Allah while you are of the humiliated-trif
le ones also the entire those who wronged themselves that shut-down Allah’s houses (of worship) with the pretense of prevention they will definitely open it and to it they will escape::: and we surely truthful::: and you surely will know.

Anyway::: — O community of best foremost supporters from various regions::: let the focus be accomplished exclusively on publishing three explanatory-sta
tements at the first level::: the explanatory-sta
tement that we wrote it by its title that follows: (Coronavirus and the decisive explanatory-sta
tement::: and it is not a joke..)::: title of the explanatory-sta
tement has ended. You must know the sure knowledge that there is in it a healing to what’s in the chests::: guidance::: and mercy for the believers. And peace be upon the messengers::: and praise be to Allah Lord of the worlds.

Quote From the Imam Mahdi's statement
🇺🇸👇🇺🇸🌷🇺🇸👇🇺🇸
Our fatwa has preceded with Truth that what they call it coronavirus has a source that is not unknown in the decisive grand Quran; (some tiniest-creatur
e) yet they do not encompass knowledge about it::: and the word (some) is built for the upcoming unknown::: and here it is the time of fulfilling the setting of parable has come; the promised challenge from Allah in the Book. As that the new sorts of viruses against the humans which has lengthy lifespan; amphibious::: air-floater::: winter(y)::: summer(y)::: it is equipped with its source; a miracle from Allah to live in all (seasonal) climates in order to be a worldwide chastisement::: and it is not as the epidemic verses that the humans know; in fact::: it has lengthy lifespan; it lives in the human’s body cunning (being contagious) from (one) human being to (another) human being exclusively::: then it lives in the open air after its exiting from the body so it would live as well without a body till when Allah pleases in order to afflict others::: being driven by the command of its Lord afflicting therewith whom He pleases and turning it away from whom He pleases. and the source has a big role it carries out its role with exceeding speed::: and it is some tiny creature yet your eyes do not see it. An addition in the creation and challenge from Allah::: a new creation (some tiniest-creatur
e) as if it is a war plain; in fact it is faster than your war plains and your land::: air and space missiles by a great difference it travels by Allah’s words glory be to Him::: and its mission is entering into the chest of a human being to scatter its eggs into the chests a scattering with exceeding speed laying its eggs inside the chest of a human being::: in order for its virus offspring to be transmitted from humans to humans after the eggs are hatched then it multiply and divide inside the body of a human being as the spread of fire in dry straw so it would transmit from a human being to another human being. And by now means and never infect an animal nor birds no matter what they lie to you surely they will not and would never bring the clear scientific proof::: also will not and would never afflict the seen mosquito at all::: in fact its hidden source is (Alba-oodah) the hidden tiny creature and it is the set parable in the creation by be and it is also it does not have a male that Allah created it from it nor has a female mother has laid it; in fact::: a tiny creature (ba-ooda) of challenge::: a new parable among the nations of tiny creatures. And it is (ba-oodah) tiny creature that Allah created with words of His power “Be” and it is. And it is not of the stingers nor the carriers of your disease from species of the known mosquito that you have::: holly Allah. In fact it is of the piercing penetrating (creature) that has an extraordinary exceeding speed that takes one of the humans who it invades him into his chest so it would take it as incubator for its eggs then it scatters its eggs with extraordinary speed scattering::: then it departs the body::: set off with extremely high speed leaving its eggs inside the chest of the human being::: so it would hatch through its nursery then viruses sprout from it and multiply in the body of a human being into (many) viruses::: and (center) its activity is in the chest. As for the factory of eggs for the lord obeying (ba-oodah) minute creature it leaves the body directly::: and only it makes the human being as a nursery for its eggs until it hatches then spread in the body (like) spreading of fire in the dry straw::: also center of multiplication of it is in the chest so it would infect by the tiny-seeds of its eggs from which it emerges::: as that the way of infections to other people from a human being to another human being::: through the open air; an air swimmers; so it would remain as living creatures in the air::: and it is not a mere world pandemic passing through::: willing he who pleased and rejects he who refused::: because the passing through pandemic is a cloud and it diminishes. Fare from::: very far::: I did not declare it to the humans as a mere world pandemic passing through; in fact I announced it (being) a world chastisement continuing night and day by Allah’s command::: the One::: the Subduer::: in various countries of the worlds with fluctuating levels from one person to another. For each are levels according to what they did::: some of it a warning and some of it an evil spread far and wide; in fact the new mother minute creature (Ba-oodah) is a worldwide calamity from the minor chastisement for you may humble yourselves to your Lord and beseech to Him repenting turning near to Him to have mercy for you so He would remove away from His chastisement::: so you would follow His Book the grand Quran. Then you obey Allah’s khalifa over the worlds::: His servant Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammad Al-Yemeni.

So do not be haughty above Allah’s khalifa then He would curse you a grievous curse as He cursed satan who got haughty above prostration to Adam; the human being — first khalifa of Allah — of mankind. So do not think the Imam Mahdi is dumb::: in fact smart and I am aware of I say::: I still insist that what you call it coronavirus is a living creature breaks-down and splits in the bodies of humans. There is no virus of its kind in the bodies of pigs::: donkeys::: cows::: camels nor in the entire cattle::: and the entire animals and birds are being disassociated from this world chastisement that continues night and day in various climates among the worlds.

I call Allah to witness and indeed Allah is a sufficient Witness that it is not as the causing illness viruses of which the human physicians know it — who are specialized in science of viruses that can not live except in bodies::: in fact itself and its source the hidden (Ba-oodah) tiny creature you can not annihilate it with the entire insect eradicators; in fact it will remain alive whether in your bodies or in the air::: sea::: or land::: as well it lives in various climates regardless you are pleased or deny::: yet it is not forever; in fact::: it is continuing until you submit to Allah’s khalifa so you would follow Allah’s Book the grand Quran and disbelieve in what is contrary to Allah’s decisive Book the grand Quran::: I am a trustworthy advisor to you before (Allah) effaces faces then turns them on their backs or curse them as He cursed the Sabbath breakers a grievous cures when He pleases if did benefit you the chastisement admonition of (ba-oodah) the tiny creature that is originated from its minute-eggs::: thus it breaks-down and splits — a chastisement to what is in the chests::: verily each is broken-down and split for you may believe::: and I give you an example about this: One grain out of which grow seven ears::: in every ear a hundred grains::: so look at this grain that you eat; it broke-down and split into hundreds of grains from one original grain::: this example only for you to know the intended of dividing and splitting and I do not say to you words of play and prose::: so keep your duty to Allah the One::: the Subduer.

O community of the dead (by) corona from chastisement of Allah::: inform the inmates of hell before you::: (tell them) to not wait for intercession of anyone from His servants on judgement day::: they should call on Allah the Most merciful to them rather than His servants::: surely His promise is ever True by responding and He is the Most Merciful (more so than all) the merciful ones::: inform them that Allah::: if He shut for them door of repentance from evil deeds to the fact they would never do evil after death::: in fact each soul would wish that between it and what it has done of evil (deeds) a far distant-time::: rather say to them: Indeed::: if Allah had shut the door of deeds after death — in the Book — verily He did not shut door of (supplication) prayer::: glory be to Him::: How can He shut door of His generosity and His mercy::: also His promise is ever True and He is the Most Merciful (more so than all) the merciful ones?

It lives in all seasons of earth latitude and longitude; a new living creature and a new parable from the species of tiniest-creatur
es. O children of Adam::: in fact it is blood tiniest-creatur
e from its minutest size::: that is chastisement of evil-plague in the Book by which Allah subjected pharaoh and his soldiers::: tiny in its size yet great in its annihilation::: in fact it is most damaging than the flood::: locust::: bugs and frogs; in fact it is blood disease directly inflicts children of Adam from the minor chastisement to those who turn away from the Book::: and we do not show them a sign but it is bigger than its sister::: and it is similar signs differ in annihilation and infliction by which Allah aided every prophet::: so He inflicted their folks from the minor chastisement. Allah’s prophets said to them an evil-plague has fallen upon you from your Lord and it is from the minor chastisement before the major chastisement for you may return so you call on Allah::: Him Alone::: begging and humble from the humiliation then they promised their Lord to follow caller of the Truth from their Lord to remove away from them what inflicted them of harm::: so Allah responded to them and removed what they have of harm then He commanded His soldiers that occupy against them in their land to leave their land and Allah healed them::: but unfortunately::: after they been healed of what inflicted them they said: It is mere pandemic has inflicted our forefathers before and they were healed from it before us. And Allah the Most High said: {And We did not send a prophet to a town but We seized its people with distress and affliction that they might plead (humbling themselves).(94
) Then We changed the evil for good::: till they became affluent and said: Distress and happiness did indeed touch our fathers. So We took them by surprise while they perceived not.(95)}Truthf
ul Allah the Great [Al-A`arãf] 7:94-95
{وَمَاۤ أَرۡسَلۡنَا فِی قَرۡیَةٍ مِّن نَّبِیٍّ إِلَّاۤ أَخَذۡنَاۤ أَهۡلَهَا بِٱلۡبَأۡسَاۤءِ

In fact::: it is from levels of the minor chastisement::: for each are levels of what they did but most people do not know::: would Allah inflict them with this but as warning to them so Allah would not annihilate them by the major chastisement altogether while they are ungrateful-disb
elievers? But unfortunately::: after they pleaded to their Lord humbly crying (Allah) had mercy for them and removed what befell them::: then lo! They broke their covenant and their hearts hardened after the pleading and humbling! And Allah the Most High said: {And indeed We sent (messengers) to nations before you then We seized them with distress and affliction that they might humble themselves.(42)
Yet why did they not::: when Our punishment came to them::: humble themselves? But their hearts hardened and satan made all that they did seem fair to them.(43) Then::: when they neglected that with which they had been admonished::: We opened for them the gates of all things. Until::: when they rejoiced in that which they were given::: We seized them suddenly; then lo! they were in utter despair.(44)}Tr

O decision makers::: leaders of the humans and their people altogether in various regions::: I exhort you only to one thing that you rise-up forGod’s sake by twos and singly::: then ponder who is the one that God fulfilled to him the challenge with Truth upon the actual reality in regard to what they call it coronavirus?

Indeed::: if You do not forgive us and (not) have mercy on us we would surely be of the losers. Oh our Allah::: You have said in Your decisive Book: {And your Lord says: Pray to Me::: I will answer you.}Truthful Allah the Great [Ghãfer] 40:60::: so from me is the supplication and turning (close) yet from You is to responding::: indeed you You never violate Your promise::: our Lord::: glory be to You::: Surely Your promise is ever True and You are the Most Merciful than all who have mercy. O our Allah::: make us steadfast upon fulfilling what we promised You to follow Allah’s global caller khalifa of Allah in the land; the Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammad Al-Yemeni.

..Coronavirus and the decisive explanatory-sta
tement::: and it is not a joke👇👆",How many can go in a business and light up a cig? Same premise.,You only have a 15% chance of getting it of you both have masks on.,If the droplets from asymptomatic people were carrying such significant virus load why is the PCR test so invasive then? Just spitting on it should be enough to trace the virus.,So the science changed ?,hold on. They said if we wear mask and are not sick and somebody that is sick can still transmit the virus to me. So mask are not the real answer. Thought that germs on counter top door handle and on our bodies was a good way to catch this super germ. Why have we not been required to wear gloves?? Saw that this germ is so bad that only 2 yes two over the counter products kill it. Lysol and a Lysol mix. . Can you see where this is going. Fear::: Think that this is being exposed as a political problem.WW2 Germany said problems everywhere. Give us your guns and we will protect you. Yeah that worked out great. What is happening to our once Great country. All of a sudden::: riots::: killings::: destruction of businesses::: E.L.M.::: NO SPORTS:::NO TRAVEL::: . . I am not telling anyone don't wear a mask. This is a political problem. with a small touch of germs. Do we do this with the flu::: or other viruses? nope. remember they are not taking your rights away. You are giving them your rights away.,A lot of sheeple on here. But of course what do expect from Austin. Should be called little California.,Spencer Wells should be fired immediately. Maybe your horns have a different devil connotation. Because he is the devil.,Is this how people reacted when wearing a seatbelt became law? Did people lose their minds and think their rights were being violated? Wearing a seatbelt might save your life- in fact the chances are greatly improve that you won't die in a car accident. Wearing a mask can save you from catching the coronavirus and prevent you from spreading in case you are asymptomatic and you don't know you are a carrier. Cases will lower and people will be safer if we can comply and wear a mask to protect others and protect ourselves. Clearly the people who are adamantly against wearing a mask have not been personally touched with someone who has been very sick or even died from the virus. Clearly they don't believe in the science. And do these same people wear seatbelts while in a car? Maybe they don't.,Jessica L BK,"https://

GREETINGS FROM THAILAND❤️🇹🇭
Kindly please visit us. Thank you.","If the people that know that if they get the virus that it could bad for them wear their masks voluntarily AND those that are actually sick wear their masks WHY do I have to wear a mask if the rest of the people aren’t wearing theirs either?

Out of the rest of the people that don’t wear their masks::: myself included in this scenario::: are voluntarily taking our own health into our own hands. If masks are such the great answer to this::: then those vulnerable people are protected from my germs when they wear their masks. A FREE SOCIETY SHOULDN’T BE MANDATED TO DO THIS. That’s not the way things are supposed to work here. Hence::: this stupid crap is “an order” and not a law passed legally by people that we elect to pass laws. An order is not law and will have consequences because if this order is law::: what else can one person order and make law? Way worse things you won’t like as it circumvents our Constitution. Masks today::: tomorrow surrender your cars because you driving around is a safety risk and you can hurt someone else. EVERY POWER GRAB IS DONE IN THE NAME OF SAFETY!!!!!!",Bs,Watch out::: you're about to find out how many of your graduates aren't that bright after all.,If people at huge risk are wearing a mask::: and people that are sick wear a mask.....why again am I wearing a mask?,At what rates would masks not be required for daily life?

"Texas Global at The University of Texas at Austin
July 7::: 2020 at 10:55 AM ·

Read more on our website at https://utx.global/stay-informed.",2020-07-07 18:07:53,Don't kid yourself::: with any university it's ALL about the money just like any business,The damage this will do to cooperation of universities from abroad with universities from the US will be immeasurable. When I did my PhD .Dissertation there I had contact with colleagues from Spain::: England::: Italy Germany::: I could travel there and they would receive me with open arms and provide me with any documents or information I needed. As we close the door and go back to the dark ages all cooperation and help will cease.,How’s ICU capacity in Austin now? Are you really going to force certain group of ppl to show up in person classes? International students don’t even have families around. How cruel!,What UT is complaining about::: is the potential loss of big foreign tuitions::: fees::: and banking the graduate level courses that foreign students buy. Follow the money.,As an international alumni I wholeheartedly disagree with this decision by ICE and the US Government. In the case of UT::: how do you expect that the school’s motto of “What starts here changed the world” to continue be relevant if the country is closing its doors and kicking our international students. People who invested time::: money and energy in order to study at a US university::: pay 3 times more and are upheld to the most strict standards to be later let down through either these decisions or the mess that comes after graduation with OPT and the lack of employers wanting to hire any internationals because (again) they are afraid of ICE,Offer a one hour “in-person” course that is pass/fail without limitations on how many students can register. Have them sign in for attendance and that’s it!,UT needs to offer one free::: one hour::: in person::: pass/fail class to every international student to protect their visa status.,Hey how about we send the students from communist nations back??,"I just thought about something... UT currently houses a number of illegal alien students... ie. Students whose family are here undocumented...
what is this ICE regulation have anything to do with anything???!!",Is it just me... we are letting the illegal aliens who crossed the borders illegally to stay in the USA and sendings back all of the “paying and legally arrived and legally documented” students? Not to mention they are paying double the price of our tuition. Conclusion: 1. The Government is trying bankrupt the Universities. Also the chain effect would be so damaging for years to come... 2. America is entering a “lockdown mode” by withdrawing itself from the world. 3. Attending College is not just about classes::: it’s learning and hanging with each other and building new friendships. This rich learning experience let’s our future leaders build personal relationship with other exchange students and vice versa. Finally::: recommend a required class that is in person for all exchange students: Building Relations (or Shopping Class) and that is a required in person class being held twice a week in Home Depot. 🤓,Nobody seems to care about the financial situation of these students. What will they do with their apartment leases? They will be risking their health flying back and forth. And air tickets dont come cheap,Alan Bloebaum,"The fear and anger is sad. #makeamericahate
again",If you’re bringing other students back (US nationwide)::: it seems cruel to send back international students. Keep them here and figure it out. Don’t punish them for an administration that couldn’t contain a virus with months of heads up.,Jesus Muñoz Muñoz Castañeda,"Send them home if they can’t qualify to stay . They can finish school in their home country .
Give their slots to Africa American students ::: BLACK LIVES MATTER ::: right and they are USA citizens .
Great idea give them all scholarships .

Call it AMERICANS FIRST SCHOLARSHIPS . That would increase UT diversity for Black students to approx 20% from 4% .
Waiting for reply",Create safe::: hybrid learning spaces on campus where students can take classes remotely while still be on 40 acres. Utilize large theater seating to keep students at a distance from each other while making wifi available. Should satisfy ICE and the students learning needs.,They have every single right to be here just as any Longhorn. They’ve signed lease with apartments and dorms. We aren’t assured what’s to come in the spring::: but if UT is doing this now for the fall I would hope they would protect and not let ICE ruin our students lives. Having to pick an online course is risky for their health and so is flying back to their country. If they haven’t gone back this whole time or if they’re planning to come back to UT that should be respected.,Please keep all them in Austin. We can do this! HOOK 'EM!🧡🤘,So::: are y'all just not going to talk about the employee that died of COVID-19 working on a campus with no students?,"I went to UT as part of an honour exchange program between my Alma Mater Universität Würzburg and The University of Texas at Austin - so sad to hear about this. It was the greatest year of my times in school/
university. (BTW::: It is 9:04pm in Germany - and OU still sucks.) Peace::: and Hook'em Horns. 🤘",But we sure can throw those football players on that field and tell them to play elbow to elbow! This is the smartest virus....open up the damn school and let EVERYONE COME BACK !! Good Lord!,Send them else where.,It’s a good thing UT hasn’t cancelled in person classes for the fall. I know that can change though,So sad for the students. Can we just try to work together to get through a pandemic?,Denise Sheehan,Please ensure that you offer these students hybrid options so that you do not jeopardize their immigration status.,Such cruelty being inflicted in the middle of a pandemic::: as if there weren't enough problems already.

"We are releasing key elements of our plan for the fall semester::: which will include online::: hybrid and in-person learning options for students. Our goal — as it has been from the beginning — is to create an environment that is as safe as possible for all community members::: while reigniting the learning::: teaching and research that make our university the world-changing place that it is.

Our plan provides a framework for the fall that is designed to accommodate the dynamic environment we’re facing and enable us to adapt to changes in the prevalence of COVID-19 in Austin and throughout Texas. And we know that things are changing every day.

Every person in our community has their own circumstances and concerns to contend with during this difficult time. Our faculty and staff members have stepped up to adapt courses and develop an innovative range of formats for teaching and learning::: and their efforts will continue throughout the summer.

For students and families::: we want you to have the ability to make informed choices about how you experience the fall semester::: while keeping in mind that COVID-19::: and its spread in Texas::: will continue to shape the exact ways we teach::: learn::: work and conduct research on and off campus. We are also reimagining student life activities::: to hold them either fully or partially online or in outdoor spaces.

On protect.utexas.edu::: you will find an in-depth look at all of our fall planning decisions. The new Protect Texas Together website::: which provides specific guidance for students and families::: faculty::: staff and visitors and answers many frequently asked questions::: can be found at protect.utexas.edu.

"High school students who apply to The University of Texas at Austin for fall 2021 undergraduate admission will not be required to submit an ACT or SAT test score as part of their application.

This change will allow the university to better serve potential students by ensuring that testing limitations related to COVID-19 do not affect a student’s ability to apply:

UT Austin Will Temporarily Change Standardized Test Score Requirement - UT News",2020-06-23 20:17:49,Well::: in previous years::: UT had a minimal acceptable ACT and SAT scores of 9::: so this is just a little less administrative trivia that really was useless. Basically anyone with a pulse can go to UT. They are just finally admitting it for all to see...,How will Mccombs admit then? We’ve had act canceled twice now,Is this hate speech condoned from your professors?,Holly Farrish Ryan dang should’ve applied! this would’ve been my chance,But what about graduate admission? Are GRE and TOEFL required the same?,Rudy Martinez,Great news! Great move UT!,Keep lowering those standards! Half the kids graduating high school are barely proficient in math::: have deficient reading skills and their ability to write is atrocious. They can't find Afghanistan on a map::: and know nothing about history. The state of education is at an all time low.,Didn't really matter anyway what score a prospective student makes on these tests. Acceptance for admission is unjustly dependent on your heritage. One's color and last name is a big player.,Our daughter signed up for the SAT 3 times and all were canceled. She hasn't had the chance to take the test yet but has signed up for an August testing date. We hope that isn't canceled as well. She is close to the auto admittance percentage but is concerned it isn't enough without the test.,What about the GRE for grad students?,Maybe I could sneak in again! (SAT scores in 76 were in low area code levels),John Pratt,Well we all know affirmative action ideology overrides any sort of merit based system. So::: who cares?,"https://

GREETINGS FROM THAILAND❤️🇹🇭
Kindly please visit us. Thank you.",Laquita Moore-Wrightner,With Covid leading to the canceling of many testing sessions for students::: I’m not surprised.,Nguyen Van Hai,Benjamin Kern,Trương Thời Thắng,Fernando Villarreal wooo,That’s right.,Controversial statement I know.... but having a friend that worked for the College Board... bottom line is the tests are money makers.,Boy that's a lot of pressure off of the student,Bruce Chi and Judy Hung::: dominoes falling after University of California System abandoned ACT and SAT.,Admissions don’t need standards::: classes do. The education system::: irrespective of racial and class inequities is not leveraging technology to lower cost::: improve efficiency and improve quality. Online classes have shown how efficiently this could really be done. Why can’t we admit everybody and let the ones who can succeed do so? Why can’t we scale quality education ? We can. The university model needs to change to represent a community of learners not necessarily a campus of classrooms and researchers.,You finally listened to me,Hhhmm curious what admission reqs will be now. I find it hard to believe all testing dates have already been canceled thru the fall.,That change should be made permanent and forever. Nothing says discrimination like a one time test dictating what college you can go to.,One more nail in the SAT/ACT coffin. It’s a only a matter of time now. 🤘🏽🐂,One of the reasons they are top in the world.,"Pandemic is UT cover for forced diversity watch African American enrollment double vs White::: Asian::: and Hispanic students .
Look forward to seeing enrollment numbers in September",A lot of things will be changing as a result of COVID and hopefully for the better. It highlighted the inequality in so many things: access to healthcare::: food::: stable housing::: technology::: etc. The district where I grew up gave out free meals to students because so many have their only source of food come from school lunches. Schools issued laptops and helped set up WiFi because many homes weren’t able to just transition to online learning. There is a great disparity in our educational system and resources. Rather than complain your kid who goes to a “competitive” school and won’t be able to use their high SAT/ACT exam on a college application to beat out someone who doesn’t::: be thankful they have the resources to get a high score. Standardized testing does not measure creativity::: value diversity and favors those with higher socioeconomic advantages. We shouldn’t demerit somebody because they go to school in a part of town their parents can afford to live. Your children will get into a college::: whether it’s at UT or somewhere else. We are failing our children. We need to do better and fix our broken educational system to ensure more equality in school resources.,Lowering the standard::: one generation at a time.,Those ranking that we brag about...kiss those goodbye.,Throw out the SAT! Nothing but a big business::: rat outfit.,Marisa Segura McBrayer I wonder if other colleges will start this too?? 😳 This is the first I’ve heard::: have you & Maya heard of any?,As a UT alumni & parent of an incoming freshman::: I have concerns with this decision. Even within our own district (CyFair ISD)::: there are 12 high schools with wildly different student bodies. A student from one of the least competitive schools may be in the top 1% at one school and barely in the top 20% at another. SAT/ACT are at least an apples to apples comparison when evaluating admissions. It is a worthwhile piece of the puzzle IMO.,We are about to dumb down Americans like no generation before. Parents keep your kids home to work in the fields::: better to get some Common sense than a Common education,Throw out the profiteers whose tests tell us nothing.,Further going down the left wing lunatic rabbit hole....,"So::: what will UT use to determine admissions? I'm sure they will expand their ""holistic"" approach to achieve their desired results....",Great move. Not to mention::: research has shown significant cultural biases in standardized testing that may unfairly disadvantage minorities and foreign applicants. 🤟🏼,If you are in the top 3% you shouldn't have to take a test to be accepted anywhere. Just my opinion. 🤘,"Yea... talk about weakening the university significance...
.",What on earth? April fools joke?,GOOD. Glad my alma mater’s on the cutting edge of progress. Standardized tests are a great measure of how well you’ve prepared to take a standardized test::: and not much else. The UC system has scrapped them::: too.,They should readjust automatic admission even higher to top 3-5% of high school class if no standardized test scores in the evaluation process.,There is still testing- so not sure why this is needed. There are test sites. They simply need to just add days::: as needed,Ya know UT::: graduates would like their diploma’s to mean something. Y’all have lost your minds!! I hope this is fake news!!,Omar Perez are you a senior? 👀👀👀👀👀👀,Kelton Rozell,Nataly Montoya Look Cousin!,"Alexandra Buchanan I think we’re good examples of why standardized tests can totally suck it. 🤷🏼‍♂️

Proud of UT.",Good!,Outstanding!,Keely Edgar,Alan Bloebaum,Gabriella Jordan thought you’d be interested since it’s UT.,Liz Matos,Noemi Gomez,Claudia Guerrero Guerra,Isaias Torres,Finally.,Ernesto Moreno,Willette Guinhawa Ho,Adrianna Gaspard,Anne Morin Martin,Jordan Clay,???

"As we move into the final days of June::: we continue to solidify our plans for the fall. We are keeping a close eye on COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations in Austin and across Texas::: which have been on the rise in recent weeks. The disease remains a persistent threat::: and our university community must continue to develop plans that are dynamic and adaptable so we can adjust quickly to future circumstances as they arise.

Thank you for your patience and understanding as we have carefully plotted out a series of measures and plans designed to keep our community safe and carry forward our education and research missions.

Next week::: we will share our complete plan for the fall semester::: along with our comprehensive website for students::: faculty and staff.

As the pandemic has shifted in recent weeks::: the university has decided to expand the number of online courses available in the fall to about 3:::500 of our 11:::000 courses — an increase of approximately 1:::500 from our initial strategy. This will give students and families greater flexibility as they make their plans by presenting a range of high-quality learning experiences both on and off the Forty Acres.

Fall 2020 Planning Update | June 23",2020-06-23 16:40:06,Just learned that 4 out of 5 of our sons classes this fall will be online. As we are coming 1800 miles from Pennsylvania::: is it even worth it? Paying room and board for out of state tuition? Will there be any concessions for out of state students to perhaps stay home in the fall but have “in state” tuition? We are reconsidering everything at this point. So disappointed.,"3:::500 courses out of 11:::000 courses made online is not enough - UT needs to have ALL 11:::000 courses available online.
We are literally talking life & death here.",Updates are appreciated but a timely decision will help my daughter sort out her housing...if both semesters cannot be guaranteed to be on campus( bc of COVID) and one is online::: don’t you think students will be better served::: just doing both semesters online? The situation has been evolving::: I know but with the added stress of trying to secure limited accommodation and committing to leases can be avoided. The well-being of the students in that regard hinges upon a timely decision. We don’t want another situation where we pay for housing and can’t be let off like this year she pays till July ending when school has been online since March. Thank you,"I pray 🙏🏽 UT makes the right decision and make ALL courses on line::: at least through fall 2020!

I have two children that attend that campus::: one having asthma! I am not comfortable as a parent::: with not only my children but ALL students and staff that will be at a HUGE RISK of contracting this highly contagious & very lethal virus!!",NO TRUE according to we healthcare peeps and stages,Mayeli Sal,You are killing us on the housing costs.,"Gospel
Mark 12:28-34
One of the scribes came to Jesus and asked him:::
“Which is the first of all the commandments?”
Jesus replied::: “The first is this:
Hear::: O Israel!
The Lord our God is Lord alone!
You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart:::
with all your soul::: with all your mind:::
and with all your strength.
The second is this:
You shall love your neighbor as yourself.
There is no other commandment greater than these.”
The scribe said to him::: “Well said::: teacher.
You are right in saying:::
He is One and there is no other than he.
And to love him with all your heart:::
with all your understanding:::
with all your strength:::
and to love your neighbor as yourself
is worth more than all burnt offerings and sacrifices.”
And when Jesus saw that he answered with understanding:::
he said to him::: “You are not far from the Kingdom of God.”
And no one dared to ask him any more questions.","The fall information is great::: but my daughter is concerned about spring as well. If she does online classes in the fall and stays home::: what are the housing options for spring going to look like. The housing office has already published deadlines for decisions (that cost money) when the academic side is still trying to sort things out. I realize there are a lot of moving parts to what’s happening::: but a little better coordination would go a long way to help ease nerves/
anxiety.",Tanya Turner,Please make an online option for out of state students,Nick Sparkman this school is run by businessmen and idiots and the Venn diagram for those two groups is a circle,Hopefully the rise is cases is from those people who were running rampant on the streets “protesting.” I hope my son is studying and not protesting.,Going to make us schedule all of our classes again. Cmon now.,Aunica Cesena 💖,Dtr is living in an apartment with 1 roommate who may be staying home for online classes in the fall. Leaves my daughter in a predicament for housing. It causes a lot of stress to the kids and the parents when there are so many unknowns.,whatever plan you make::: you need to make it for both semesters because students are trying to figure out housing,D Lanelle Holmes,Wish we could hear something about dorms. Not giving us much time to find alternate places if they can’t live there 😟,My UT degree continues to devalue as time goes on....:(,Desiree Jackson,One of my classes that I need to graduate has been cancelled.

"A message from Interim President Jay Hartzell:

Dear UT Community:::

During the past few days::: I have heard from many students::: alumni::: faculty and staff asking for meaningful changes to promote diversity and equity and ensure that black students at UT are fully supported. It is important::: first::: for me to listen closely — and then to work with the entire community to develop a plan to move the university forward.

These letters::: calls and petitions come amid the national outrage over the killing of George Floyd and other black people by police. They reflect the deep pain and frustration that many of you feel about where we are as a society and a university.

I have begun scheduling conversations with students::: including leaders of black student organizations and student athletes::: as well as other community members to hear their concerns and ideas directly.

Working together::: we will create a plan this summer to address these issues::: do better for our students and help overcome racism.

I thank you for your ideas and ongoing guidance and welcome your emails and suggestions. I pledge that we will come together as a community to make The University of Texas an even greater place.

Listening Closely and Moving Forward Together",2020-06-15 19:48:28,The Eyes of Texas is UT. Proud alum and legacy. Quit trying to destroy history.,"The University of Texas was fine when they accepted to attend::: received a scholarship and probably enjoy the perks of being an athlete. Why didn’t it bother you when you received the scholarships? Leave if you are offended.
My concern is that athletics is so important to the university::: are they going to give in in order to continue the money made on athletics and please those who donate?
What about all other races?
I am of Hispanic origin and was elected Student Dietetic Association in the late ‘70’s (and my opponent was not Hispanic). Also while there::: a Hispanic was elected to lead Student Government and the office was disbanded. Life goes on. Did we riot::: burn down businesses or buildings? No... get over it::: respect all and leave if you don’t agree with our GREAT institution.
Hook ‘Em",Keep that song. Whatever chosen will have an issue. That song really has nothin to do with nothin. Why::: all of a sudden::: is it a problem. Everybody has some problem with something. You will never please everyone. Ignore it. Another complaint will come up about something else very soon.,Do anything you want...just don’t get rid of our school song. I imagine all the black::: white and brown athletes who have proudly stood there...win or lose... and sung The Eyes of Texas along with fans after every game and how much would be lost without it. Surely on balance this world hurt rather than help.,Just please leave The Eyes of Texas alone. Thank you🤘🤘🤘,"The motto of my Alma Mater is ""what starts here changes the world."" This is an incredible opportunity for the University of Texas at Austin to declare they stand by their teaching and listen to their current and former students. Respectfully::: re - naming buildings and removing statues from a publicly funded university is the very least we can do. Change the song. It's a step in the right direction.",If you change anything about our traditions::: many will stop supporting this university. You should be thankful you even go there,The Eyes of Texas has to go! All the request are reasonable.,"Where is everyone seeing info on changing the song?

I really hope this doesn’t happen. That song is everything to UT::: and there isn’t any racial undertones to it. What’s the problem? I’m absolutely open to equality and diversity::: but what’s up with our school song?",Why oh why do we have to change everything. It's been good forever now it's not. Against changing song and stadium.,Think the people who donate the Big Bucks will have a lot to say about keeping The Eyes of Texas. Hook’m,"Thank you for listening to these young men.

We should all listen ... we should all be proud of them ... and we should move forward in an effort to make certain that all students and student athletes are well served by the University",For decades I’ve sung The Eyes of Texas. To me::: it brought nothing but pride in my school. Now I’ve learned about how::: now and for decades past::: the song has brought hurt and pain to others. Why would I::: or anyone::: want to sing a song that hurts others? Why would a university of the first class want that?,Why does everything need to change! Theres alot i can think of but things like this are not one of them. So now all protesters are winning and the hell with everyone else.,Get rid of the song! It’s a symbol of the confederacy and doesn’t support UT’s current ideals. I’m a proud UT alum and support the diversity and inclusivity that UT preaches. Support the students::: they’re our future. People are much more important than a few words. ❤️,The eyes of texas isn't even an original song and the lyrics are creepy. learning about its roots in racism ought to be enough for a reasonable and compassionate person to see how it contributes to systemic racism at worst and feelings of discomfort for some students of Color and their allies at best. i fully support changing it and renaming buildings as necessary.,Dialogue is always good. Demands never are. The biggest issue is that funds should not go towards any organization that donates to any political parties. I think an inner city outreach program is a great idea and perfect for a portion athletic funds. Learn from history::: continue to diversify the campus::: less “whitening” of history books::: but you can’t erase what happened in the past. You (hopeful) teach our future not to make the same mistakes.,"Instead of focusing on the past::: or trying to erase it::: why not use the ""Eyes of Texas"" as a positive anthem going forward as in ""I see you::: I hear you. Strength in Unity. As in ALL of the eyes of Texas are upon you. Because we're better together""",I think we should get back to this being an institution of higher learning::: have every student be equal and be admitted with the same academic standards and each of them have the same access to tutors and everything they need to be academically successful. If they choose to be part of a sports team or student government or whatever that is their prerogative.,I’m mean. The lyrics are on the creepy side for representing a heavyweight college like UT. I know the words by heart. I went to UT Austin. I’m down for something fresh and less “I’ve been workin on the railroad.” It is a traditional song::: but we have so many traditions. Like the quote says...”What starts here::: changes the world.” UT is an innovator::: which means change. And change is good.,I’m a life member of Texas Exes and the Longhorn Foundation .

Keep the song but don’t force anyone to sing it. If you don’t like it don’t sing it. If you like it sing it.,If the “Eyes of Texas” gets banned::: so does my money!

I love my alma mater and refuse to see legitimate traditions uprooted over the cultural extortion of a handful of radicals.,I say keep the song::: if athletes leave....good let them. Most are on a scholarship anyways so the scholarship doesn’t go with them. They are only hurting themselves. Find new recruits....,This is much needed. This isn’t a new debate. Students of color at UT have been calling for these changes for decades but the student athletes never got behind it. Now that the athletes have used they’re voices hopefully things will actually change.,Wow::: the University is really going to be held hostage to a group of athletes who accepted scholarships to attend? A list of demands?? Change the school song?? Give me a break::: those things change nothing about a bad cop who does the wrong thing. You give in to the insane list of demands it won’t be long till you get the next list. Surely the university sees this slippery slope.,The song is creepy and something’s wrong if you think it’s worth more than having pride in your alma mater.

Yes::: it was sung in an unfortunate place years ago::: but the song itself is not meant to put anyone down.

I agree with most of the other athlete demands and agree they shouldn’t be forced to sing it::: but at the same time no one is forcing them to go to Texas. I’ve been a die hard fan for 25 years and haven’t heard about the history of the song until now. So what gives?

I see it as a unifying song. Win or lose::: we were all in it together. Some of my best memories are of singing The Eyes with my dad after a last minute win with hoarse voices and teary eyes.

I do not support the anonymous student athletes’ demands to donate to Black Lives Matter or to rename buildings or to change the school song.

It’s wonderful that things have changed for the better over a hundred some years. This song has for decades meant that Texas athletes and students Eyes are upon the world and determined to be the best of the best. Can’t we all rally together around what it actually means today? No one sings this song with the intent of supporting racism. We can all agree on that I’m sure. UT athletes are treated like royalty and are beyond blessed to be affiliated with this superior school. We are the greatest University in the world. We have to find a way to rally together through this very disheartening time. If anyone took offense to what I said I am apologetic. That was the last thing I wanted to do. I just wanted to express how many interpret the song and to so many it is sacred.

4. You will need to rename Washington:::D.C.

5. The Custis-Lee mansion at Arlington cemetery will need to be torn down because it was a plan statin and they were slave owners.

6. Mt. Vernon and Monticello will need to be torn down because they were plantations.

7. Andrew Jackson::: George Washington::: and Thomas Jefferson need to be removed from all currency because they were slave owners.

8. Georgia needs to be renamed because it is named after an English King who tried to surpress or freedoms and who we defeated in a war.

9. Six Flags should be closed down because one of the flags is the confederate flag.

10. The University of Virginia needs to be torn down because it was designed by a slave holder—Thomas Jefferson.

11. Washington state needs to be renamed and it’s flag changed because Washington was a slave holder.

12. Mt. Rushmore needs to be recharged to take away the 2 faces of slave holders—Washing
ton and Jefferson.

Let’s just rewrite our history instead of learning and moving forward.",Good bye season tickets and any support I've ever had for you.,We are more than a song.,please keep the song change everything else if you want,"Keep the song! Keep the Stadium!

Look at those with angry emoticon. Not many people of color there 😂😂😂,Capitalize Black,"The Snowflakes complaining are the biggest part of the problem.

I heard that Prairie View A&M will welcome the Snowflakes.

Problem solved.","LEAVE IT......
This is getting absolutely out of hand. Geez! Don’t like it then go to another college! That is your choice","It's a pretty simple concept::: people

If you care more about a dumb song than actual people::: you're not a good person and have a lot of work to do on yourself. This is the least important thing in the world to get upset over::: and yet here you guys are::: throwing a baby tantrum 🙄",Good on you! Proud to be a longhorn! Don't let the few loud racists voices drown out the call for justice coming from everyone else. Hook 'em 🤘,"Don’t mess with “the eyes of Texas” .... if we look back at the roots of every song::: every book::: author::: saying::: logo or marketing campaign we are sure to find something that just might offend someone! I do believe we need to take a strong look at our admissions::: recruiting::: donations::: names of buildings and inappropriate statutes however deciding that something is racist based upon when it was written who it was written by and the era it was written in is hugely misguided. Our society in 1903 was nothing like it is in 2020. I am not excusing racism
In any way form or fashion but this song being deemed as such is a travesty. We can trace many of our own personal family trees back to confederates does that make us a racist? NO it doesn’t...
this should be taken by the university as a time to unite ALL! All cultures ALL races ALL religions ALL! By getting rid of a song that is sung in pride that means we are watching out for our students::: our university::: our alumnae and that what starts here changes the world is wrong! It sends the message that we are not all equal and that we all don’t matter. Each and every longhorn does matter and for this song to be thrown into this positive social change is wrong and very sad!
Leave my “eyes of Texas” alone please!",Its crazy that many INSIST on keeping and glorifying racist history and expect us to deal with it and not be offended. Believe me::: im not intimidated or influenced by your threat to keep your alumi dollars,Lisa Liberty lol where did you go? Didn’t like my responses so you got childish and blocked me? 😂😂😂😂,Actually::: we need more diversity in the football and basketball teams. Cant we bring in more Hispanic::: Asian and Whites.,So... no more racist RLM?,Ron Hare,Ron Hare,"This black alumna is grateful that you’re correlating values to policies rather than holding onto racist symbology. We are bigger than symbols.

We all know that UT wasn’t always a refuge for Black students::: nor was Austin. I’m glad to see the university making strides to be on the right side of history.",Post taken off BON Facebook site.,"They say be vegetarians::: don't kill animals and then they do this.

It's about creating an atmosphere of tension and hate. This country has done more for minorities than any country in history but it will never be enough until Democrats control the Oval Office::: the Senate and the house. If and when that happens watch how quickly all of this disappears.,"If your school is so ""tolerant""::: then why is this raving anti-Catholic/

UT should change some of the names of buildings and streets (if that’s what is requested)::: hire more minorities as professors and provide black history classes at UT. However::: I do not believe that we should change the school song. “The Eyes of Texas” is not about hate. I only learned this week that the original melody was written as a slave hymn - I had no idea of its history and have been singing the song for decades. At some point many decades ago::: the lyrics were changed to our current song and sang by most with pride in celebration of our school. Taking away this song will be divisive and alienate alumni. With that said::: UT should look for other ways to make major improvements and significant change through music::: theater and minority clubs that support black history and education on campus. It’s time for real change::: not a shallow effort or easy fixes. UT must commit to diversity and inclusiveness through meaningful change.,"Why is ""breaking tradition"" more frightening to you than UT's racist history? Blackface was also a ""tradition"" at UT (only stopping in 1965) do you think we should've kept it for tradition's sake??? Learn to value people over ""traditions""...
abandoning a song rooted in racism shouldn't be this controversial..
. I personally cannot find any school pride or spirit in the song anymore knowing that it hurts other people (also this is not the first time people have asked to change the song..it's not just because of the ""climate""....ho
wever that is why people are finally listening)","As I understand::: players are required to stay and sing after every game. Could it be possible for that requirement to be lifted. They can elect not to sing. That would go for the rest of the folks that don't like it. I am an 85 graduate and really have no problem with the song's origins. It was over one hundred years ago. They are saying that if their demands are not met they will not do recruiting or fund raising. To me::: that is nothing but blackmail. I think that changing the song is taking things a bit too far. It's almost as ridiculous as trying to rename the city of Austin. I do not agree that the will of some should count for the will of the many. They do have the option not to participate. I believe that there are many season ticket holders that will cancel their sponsorship and many of your die hard Longhorn donors will take their money elsewhere. UT has many other things to offer than just a football team with a few players that ""demand"" changes. Before all of this unrest::: was there ever a discussion of getting rid of the school song? Probably not. People are reacting::: that's all. I will be extremely disappointed in the leadership of UT if they cave to the demands of a few hot head athletes. There is much more to UT than that. As far as changing the names of buildings::: I have no problem with that::: however I feel that the athletic department needs to pay for any changes::: starting with the player's scholarship. As far as donations for a great cause::: BLM is a political organization::: look up their website an hit the donate button. You are then redirected to a democrat fundraiser site. UT needs to stay out of the political donations. Let the players donate their time to some of the summer football programs for the underprivileged
. Let them teach those kids about how to correct racial tensions. Have them go to schools and give presentations. That will be more help than donating money. Lots of the high school players might end up being UT players. What a better way to help kids....they get to meet their idols.",Well then listen to the mass majority who is saying this is all bull crap and we are sick and tired of the false accusations of racisms because they are all LIES! White people can't sneeze without it being called racist. It is BUL:L CRAP!,Omg people actually read this message and sent an angry emoji? Straight up racists. Oh Texas.

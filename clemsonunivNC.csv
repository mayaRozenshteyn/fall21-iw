University leadership has announced updated mask requirements in statewide facilities.  GO.TIG.RS Clemson updates mask requirements as COVID rates remain low; Testing requirements remain in effect this semester · Clemson News,2021-10-25 19:49:57,I'm so ready to be done with this school. Were it not for investing so much time and money to this point I'd have to say I'm done already. Just can't give up on the thousands already spent to stop now.,Why are masks not required at football games? Is it because students are standing farther apart in the bleachers compared to sitting in classrooms? Or is it because football games bring in thousands of dollars in ticket sales and the university is too concerned with compliance and profits to use common sense?,Jim Collins,James Eidson,What makes dining halls and rec centers safer (no mask requirement) than classrooms (masks required)? What makes being inside one of those buildings safer than being inside of the other?,People aren’t actually bothered by the fact that you don’t wear a mask::: what bothers them is your disobedience::: the fact that you get to do what they can’t::: because defiance often means standing alone. They are mad that they have to comply and you don’t::: and your strength shines a light on their weakness. #DoNotComply #ClassOf2021,Why any mask requirement with that low rate?,Good grief!🙄,Yeah::: that makes sense(eye roll),Absolutely ridiculous!

We are happy to share that Clemson University was once again ranked as one of the top public universities in the country according to the 2022 U.S. News & World Report.  NEWS.CLEMSON.EDU Clemson remains top public university::: leads State of South Carolina in U.S. News rankings · Clemson News,2021-09-13 14:05:02,Proud to be part of the #ClemsonFamily! And so very proud my daughter is going to be an alumni as well!!! Go Tigers!!,Yes::: Clemson is dropping in rankings. Remember that US News adjusts its methodology::: and there were significant changes in 2021. It is nearly impossible for Clemson to knock off five or more public universities ahead of them::: especially now. Graduate debt now is a larger factor in rankings::: as is the number of Pell Grant recipients that graduate. Clemson has increased class sizes somewhat::: which was a category where they once shined. Faculty salaries remain a factor. And this year a lot of universities were dinged slightly if they had large numbers of applicants who did not submit SAT/ACT scores (even with that requirement suspended at many schools due to COVID). A wildcard factor is that 20% of a school's ranking is peer reputation. University leaders are asked to rank similar institutions::: whether or not those leaders really know much about the other schools. Bottom line: For Clemson::: USC and other SC public universities to rise in rankings::: the state must fund them at a higher level.,Wow! Go Tigers! Love my school!!!,Proud to be a Tiger!!!,Does anyone know if Clemson is bringing back their swim team?,As an Alumnus::: I would really like to see us back in the top 20! We were ranked 20th when I attended.,In prior years leadership focused on becoming a Top 20 school and made the necessary changes required to chase that goal. We have lowered our expectations dramatically. We have now traded quality for quantity. The obsession with growth numbers at such an accelerated pace has cost us in the rankings. The objective now is to gain as many out of state students as possible because they pay more in tuition. It is a financial decision. That matters more than being an elite smaller school.,Courtney Rebovich::: Nick Rebovich 😁!!!,Lily Klein🧡💜🧡💜,For those concerned with the drop to #30:  1. These rankings don’t actually mean anything; they’re made up 2. University has prioritized diversity over exclusivity 3. Enrollment increase ≠ disadvantage for in-state students 4. We’re still the best in the state,Two years ago Clemson was ranked 70 overall. Last year it went down a few spots and this year it went down again so now it’s 75 overall. It may still be best in SC but that’s not saying much if every year the overall ranking keeps slipping.,Proud to have a Tiger son in IE at Clemson! Go TIGERS!,Marci Kloskey Mindi Gerrard,Go Tigers!,Hmmm. We have slipped from 20 to 30 over the years. What are we doing wrong?,Go Clemson!!!!,But are they still doing the online tutoring for middle and high school students?,Ditto from Gran and Grandad!,30th is nothing to be excited about.,#30... I remember when it was #20 just 5 years ago and they made a big deal of it lol,Lisa Schilling,Ellie Ashmore Ralph Stone,Preston Weller,Go Tigers!,So what.,"I don't know what your point was for this email but your accusations are completely unprofessional. Attacking a professional because their beliefs do not align with yours is borderline psychotic. You speak of ""doxing someone""?? How dare you say anything to that nature when the whole point of your email was to ""doxx"" Jennifer. You aren't even man enough to provide your name. Get out of here with this nonsense and stay out of Clemson University business. You are not welcome here nor do we tolerate bullying. We are busy and don't have time to deal with things of this nature. Jennifer is an outstanding nurse and one of the best instructors we have at Clemson. She has the support of all of her coworkers.

Clemson Football September 4 at 10:07 PM ·  #ALLIN::: always.,2021-09-05 03:11:15,You need to regroup and get the offensive line figured out. The defense was great. Remember this doesn’t define you. Go Tigers!,Win or lose::: I will always support you! Learn from your mistakes and come back stronger next week. 🧡💜,I see all the half hearted bandwagon Clemson fans wasted no time showing up to run their mouths like they could have stepped on that field and done any better. All y’all couch coaches need to hush. I was frustrated myself because I’ve grown to expect more from this team than what I saw tonight but I have nothing negative to say publicly. These young men do more than most of you only lie and say you once could do. For those of you with weaker memories I’ll remind you. Trevor Lawrence as great as he is was once new and got bailed out of some tight spots by the help of Kelly Bryant as he was developing himself on the college stage. DJ unfortunately doesn’t have that opportunity. No one said tonight was going to be easy for them or that it was a guarantee. Some of you have forgotten what it means to be a Tiger.,Tough first game but a great learning experience for DJ and the team. Dabo will whip them into shape::: as he always does::: with love::: encouragement::: and positivity! Go Tigers!,Soft like a marshmallow. What an embarrassment. But at least we can get fat on the sisters of the poor starting next game. DJ needs to get on the first thing smoking back to cali. Most overrated Clemson QB since Willy Korn.,Yes. That’s hard after such a loss but it shows character.,Do we want to be in commercials or play football? Let's decide.,Keep on playing Tigers. Great defense and let’s get DJ running and passing. Tiger Fan always!!! 🧡💜,Last night was the first game I watched with my boyfriend he’s your best supporter it was a good game you guys are great love Dabo it’ll be better next week !,“Those who got you here won’t be who will get you there.” #elliotout #caldwellout Oh::: and enough Bojangles and Dr Pepper BS already. 0-2 in big games.,Let's be honest! It sucked!! Let's learn from this and do better next time!! Now go Tigers!!🐅🧡,Tigers will grow. But hey::: Three Cheers for the Tiger Band!,Quarterback sure wasn’t all in or the offense,Good Job defense. That's about all that can be said. Offense sucked.,The punter was all in!,All in. All the time! I’m a Tiger for life!,#AllIn 💜🧡🐅,Horrible! Find another quarterback 😖,These Florida Gators with two grandchildren at Clemson say::: Go Tigers! We’re with you.,First game jitters::: I hope so. no hate toward DJ but for a young man dressed to the 9’s and multiple commercials during the game::: I’d expect more output. I’d rather take an L in game 1 than later in the season. Right the ship.,I think the offense was all in another stadium.,What the heck was that guys? Just 0 adjustments::: no attempt to run the ball as usual from Tony. Worst Oline in Clemson history and that’s saying a lot because our oline always sucks. Very embarrassed,Observation is that the O line needs some work and DJ was not prepared by the coaches. We have lots of talent but it looked like the offensive scheme was not on it. This performance reminded me of the Ohio State game and the LSU game. I know the talent will overtake the rest of the teams on the schedule but the scheme is not up for top 5 matchups. I don’t know if Jeff Scott leaving is how our scheme changed but the pocket did not roll tonight and the underneath passes all seemed to be scripted routes where DJ only had one read and he froze if it was covered. I hope they figure it out. All in!,Ok::: I am a part time fan of Clemson::: but my take is this::: o-line is very young::: they did not communicate on the line for pick ups::: DJ is young and did not have full experience as a starter::: he will get better::: no doubt::: he has the skilks. Running backs need to block much better. Remember::: it's only one game and now you will be playing the ACC teams.,"I will forever be #ClemsonFamily & #ALLIN::: win or lose. Our Mama taught us::: ""If you can't say something nice::: then just be quiet."" Her words exactly. This is a rhetorical question but after reading every single comment posted here I need to ask it. How many of y'all have ever played football and if y'all have played how many have played at this level? Our entire team (players::: coaches::: band::: cheerleaders::: etc.) have access to these comments. Is what we are saying helping them or just ""piling on""? Answer for yourself. Which way do you want to go? Do you want to inspire these young people? Then think about what you are posting here. Sorry for the rant but I think we need to consider what we post in our comments. And for the competitors who think it is big of them to come here and rub our noses in our loss::: I hope y'all feel better for being so small. End of rant. #CLEMSONLOVE <3",Disappointing,Go Tigers! Very proud to be a Clemson Tigers 🧡💜🐯🏈🏆🏆🏆,Will stand by you always 🐅💞,Everyone should send Jeff Scott a postcard thanking him for two national championships.,We just out played Clemson face it GO GEORGIA!!!!!!!,Forever faithful! Luv my Tigers!!,DJ needs to take over and run thru that defense more. Don't just stand there and get sacked. He's skilled enough to plow through some of those defenders.,Win or lose always I’m an all in Tiger! We will rebound and hopefully have another shot at Georgia later in the year.,Do well,Louis Cordina,With a Tajh Boyd look alike I just hope Clemsacks can win a few games this year.,oops!,Did you not see that sale out crowd ??? It's all about the money !!!! They gonna start paying college kids this year also,I'll be a Clemson fan until the day I day. I bleed orange whether they win or lose. I love Clemson but I hate to see them lose but this was the first game of the season people. We aren't going to win it all every year. Just enjoy the ride because cfb isn't around all year. They will regroup and fix their issues like they always do. They don't need a bunch of keyboard warriors to know what they did wrong. Our defense will control the game and give the offense more chances to fix their mistakes. Relax and let's enjoy cfb!!,So how many of you thought “I miss Trevor” to yourselves last night?,Pathetic. Embarrassing. It’s ok for Clemson to lose games. It’s not OK for tigers to play scared.  Danny Ford needs to teach Dabo how to toughen a team,I'll always love my tigers. Wins come and go but there's only one team for me::: CLEMSON TIGERS!!!!!,L,Have 2 questions why did Lyn J have 1 carry and where’s kJ henry,You can tell who the fans are and who the alums are here::: lol. Yes::: it does give the alums more credibility.,Who was the idiot that scheduled an SEC opponent for our opening game? We should never meet our hardest opponent in the first game of our regular season.,Why did they have two top ranking teams playing each other in the first game of the season ? Makes no since ! Or does it 💵💰💸,Both teams played terribly! But win or loose I will always be a Clemson fan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After a thorough analysis of COVID-19 trends in the community::: University leadership has decided to extend the current mask mandate through October 8::: requiring masks in all University buildings.  NEWS.CLEMSON.EDU Clemson extends mask requirement through Oct. 8 · Clemson News,2021-09-03 14:47:19,As a Clemson Nursing alum with a Masters in Public Health working every day (after retirement) with individuals and congregate settings with cases and contacts::: I am proud of decisions by my Alma Mater to protect our students and staff. Hold strong in making the unpopular decisions that are best for everyone. 😷,Good. This is the right thing to do::: even if this state is full of people who aren't capable of understanding 7th-grade biology.,I truly hope none of you making jokes and calling names ever lose anyone close to you due to Covid…because I can promise you it won’t be quite as funny then…and just so you know the local hospital system has 46 new Covid patients hospitalized in 2 days bringing the total to 500 and 17 new in ICU making a total of 116 in ICU.  My child is happy to wear a mask to get to go to in person classes!,Thank you for keeping our children safe ❤️🐯💜,We’re wearing mask at USC Aiken for the semester. Stay safe.,For y’all getting mad::: STILL.. how many people have to die this round for you to get with it? This delta variant has been insane::: there hasn’t been a day on my Facebook that I haven’t seen new posts of another person I know being in the hospital::: ICU::: on a ventilator::: or dead from this strain of covid.,Thank you! My daughter was planning on wearing hers anyway but this makes it a safer environment for all.,Smart! Let’s keep these kids on campus!,I’m surprised a university that does so many things right (great) blows it so badly on masks! Pitiful!,Perfect. Thank you for helping to stop the spread and protect each other!,So stupid::: but completely predictable. This is not science based::: this is politics.,Knew that was coming 😒,I wish more took it seriously. It's not a joke or a political statement as these unfortunately found out: https:// www.sorryantivax xer.com/,Lots of rednecks commenting here. Clearly they are just football fans and not actual alums.,Smart move! Keep the kids in College❤️,So are you requiring the football fans wear mask?🤔,Keep the masks on!

We want to stay on campus!,Well that hasn’t worked for 18 months,https:// www.wbtw.com/ news/ state-regional-n ews/ south-carolina-s upreme-court-sa ys-columbia-sch ool-mask-mandat e-violates-prov iso/ ?utm_medium=refe rral&utm_campai gn=socialflow&u tm_source=faceb ook.com,Thanks for keeping the Tigers safe! 🧡,Smart move by Clemson. Sad to see the ignorance throughout the comments.,The priority should be to keep these kids in school. In person learning. Too many mental health issues caused by being isolated. Honestly it’s just a mask for a few more weeks. So many other scarier issues we should bring focusing on.,The universities are doing a much better job in keeping students safe and these students can choose to vaccinate. Children under 12 should be protected because they don’t have a choice 😢,Great! We can barely hear each other in class.,Good decision! 👍 we are in the middle of a pandemic so we need to do whatever it takes to contain the spread!,great choice. Thank you for keeping the Clemson community safe.,That’s great. Lets wear them in classes and then have a couple thousand unmasked::: out of state people come to the stadium today!,People please!!! We have to do what we can to protect this extremely at-risk population who only have a 99.99% chance of surviving a cough and fever.,Those who are critical of the decision should wait a week or two. By that point::: additional Columbia-area grade schools and high schools may have closed::: in addition to other schools in the state. The people complaining now will undoubtedly be the same people complaining that precautions should have been taken.,And in Death Valley?,I've spoken to a few students and as long as they can be in person for classes::: they are fine with masks!,Thank goodness! Keep the masks on!! I want my son safe and protected. He has been fully vaccinated.,Can the microbiology dept update the whole campus on viral particle size and fabric weave gaps::: plz? 🤓,Statistically speaking most kids this age and under have more a chance of dying falling down the stairs or being struck by lightning. Why not remove all staircases at the universtity as well? What if it could save one life?,Whatever it takes to keep kids healthy and on campus. It hurts no one to wear a mask inside but it could save someone.,Now if you can just get people to actually adhere to the mask mandate. If you only say it::: but 75% of the people ignore it::: it doesn’t help much.,Let me say first that I completely am in favor of wearing masks indoors however . I would to see a report about the changing of the mask. I will continue looking. If a person wears the same mask several hours or all day and is filled with body moisture is the mask still effective against COVID or other things. Are the migrants coming in from the southern border and spread around the country ordered to wear masks yet? The immigrants from Afghanistan have they been given masks yet to wear? They probably have.,I guess you can only get covid on campus or in classrooms but not in a football stadium! 🤦‍♀️,Kids should go back to eating germ infested dirt::: eating worms and bugs::: playing outside etc. man my childhood was awesome and safe,When October 8 comes they’ll extend it another month. This is just lying at this point,YEA! Everyone should do it!,Yes please. Lost a colleague last night. Devastating news and another in intensive care. Wear your mask!,In other words for the next 5 years or so.,Just get prepared for the Alpha::: Zeta::: and Gamma variants. That should get Democrats to 2022 election.,How about masks at the football games? Shoulder to shoulder with 85:::000 people is not safe. Look at what happened at that bike rally in S. Dakota and that was outside.,Way to go Clemson,They need to be worrying about that O-Line instead,In the last one and a half years::: how many people in the world have you heard of that died of regular seasonal flu. ZERO. Most all deaths are just being thrown into the category of Covid to create fear. People are more manageable when they are fearful.  Learn how to think for your own self. Make your own decisions.  Class of 1982 Mark Metts,University leadership has decided to extend being frightened little sheep through October 8::: requiring muzzles in all University buildings,I am an alumni class of 1982. Liberal decisions like this is why I am withdrawing all support from Clemson::: IPTAY::: and even football. Watch donations fall.  Masks are about SILENCING and CONTROLLING SHEEP.  I did not believe that Clemson would sell out to the cabal and global elites. But here we are.  Goodbye 👋,https:// www.theatlantic. com/ideas/ archive/2021/09/ masks-were-worki ng-all-along/ 619989/,Thank you Clemson! ❤️,Sensible decision. Thanx for keeping everyone safe 👍🏼💞,My body:::my CHOICE!!!!!,What are the stats on hospitalization s and deaths of students::: faculty and staff at Clemson?,This too will pass,Thank you!,🥱👎,https:// www.facebook.com /57886636727/ posts/ 1015849926496672 8/,These are awesome! I forget I’m even wearing a mask! I wish everyone would wear them!! They come in 2-packs now!! Such a great idea!! https:// etsy.me/2WRtmbn”,These are awesome! I forget I’m even wearing a mask! They come in 2-packs now & kid sizes too! Such a great idea!! https:// etsy.me/2WRtmbn,For everyone still arguing that masks aren't proven to reduce the spread. https:// pubmed.ncbi.nlm. nih.gov/ 33087517/ Please note that's they're more effective when worn by the virus spreader (an even better barrier than filter). No mask::: even N95 can filter 100% unless one doesn't need to breathe.,Thank you!,SO HAPPY ABOUT THIS DECISION!!,Speak to my freshman daughter daily. Hasn’t once complained about wearing a mask on campus. Actually::: she hasn’t even brought it up good or bad. She’s just thrilled she can have a “normal” college experience year 1 and not be stuck in her dorm with online classes. And as an OOS parent 15 hours away::: I’m happy about that. Spoke to parents yesterday and their kid is a freshman at a school in New England. They require 100% vaccinations::: masks for all and aren’t testing at all. To me…i like Clemson strategy given the circumstances. We all know vaccines aren’t the magic bullet but seem helpful. That’s all!  GO TIGERS! 🐅👊💪,Wise decision! Thank you!,Good!!,Smart move!!,Bruh….,👏👏,Have a great season Warriors!!,DeAnna Murphree umm nope.,So::: they come from outside::: where they were’t wearing a mask::: go inside::: wear a mask::: go back outside::: take off the mask::: and interact with other students the rest of the day::: without masks::: but this will make a difference? Huh? How about ending the charade already?,Very very proud of my alma mater. 🐅🐅🐅🐅,Boo,Thank you! Wish my daughter’s school would do the same!,What a joke,Ah so end of the year::: got it,Shocker!!,South Korea::: a country with a population of 51.7 million people::: has had 2308 deaths from COVID-19. Japan::: population 126 million::: 16:::216 deaths. What is it that they've done from the start that a lot of us here in the US are STILL refusing to do? Hmmm... Seriously::: how hard is it to wear a mask outside your home? Calling people sheep for caring about the health of themselves and others is the dumbest hsit imaginable. You should be ashamed of your ignorance and your manners.,What some people fail to realize is that when I wear a mask::: it is protecting others around me as well as myself and when they wear masks::: it is protecting them and others around them…. The more people that wear masks::: the more people are protected by them. Although::: if you are in a place where people are wearing masks and when you get outside and remove your mask and you touch your eyes::: nose::: or mouth before cleaning/ sanitizing your hands…. If you get sick::: that is not a mask failure.  https:// www.cdc.gov/ coronavirus/ 2019-ncov/ prevent-getting- sick/ cloth-face-cover -guidance.html,So many Horse Paste Enjoyers in this comment thread.,Of course!!! 😂😵‍💫🤪,Thank you!

The requirement is effective as of Aug. 17 for a period of three weeks.  This three-week period coincides with the greatest risk predicted by our public health team’s modeling of the disease. Masks were shown in our models to a have significant impact on curbing the spread of the virus and correspondingly enhances our ability to stay in person.  The University continues to evaluate all public health data as it mitigates the prevalence of COVID-19 while maximizing opportunities to continue in-person classes.

Effective immediately::: masks will be required in all University facilities statewide for a period of three weeks.  NEWS.CLEMSON.EDU Clemson temporarily requires masks in University facilities at semester start · Clemson News,2021-08-18 00:00:53,Yes. As a Clemson nursing grad and Acute Disease Epidemiology Nurse Consultant::: I applaud this news. Additional: Masters in Public Health.,Assuming the goal is in-person classes::: masking and a vaccine mandate are the only way to do it. And it is too late to mandate vaccines. This is a last-minute scramble::: but at least it is a scramble in the right direction.,Pediatrician and Clemson alum: This is how we keep Clemson students safe and this is how we hopefully preserve the football season::: for those most worried about that. I wear a mask all day::: every day. It hasn't diminished my mental capacity yet (that I am aware of). It very definitely has decreased my risk of catching COVID from a patient or family member in my office. It's all part of a layered strategy to minimize the risks of spread- masking::: vaccine::: hand hygiene::: distancing. All of them help but none of them alone will be enough to keep our students safe. We're all in this together. Nothing worth fighting about here. We need to support our students to do the right things to keep themselves and their friends safe and to keep Clemson open for in-person learning.,I am SO thankful this is in place!!! IF we want in person classes::: this was the only way to keep that!! K-12 in Pickens County had so many positive cases and quarantines they have had to go fully virtually (Kershaw Co. is watching/ adjusting in areas)! We DON’T want that!!! Our son is thankful (and so are we) that this has been put in place!!!! 💜💜💜,This is not forever people. Think. It is for 3 weeks! I see Clemson working to keep everyone safe.,I am glad Clemson is doing this::: and frankly am appalled at all the people who are so anti mask. My elementary school child wore a mask all year last year and whined less than the folks I see here. If a simple act like wearing a mask keeps people safe::: keeps your kids in person classes::: then is it such a huge sacrifice? A mask is a heck of a lot easier to wear than a ventilator.,Nurse here…Class of 87. I am reading thru all the whiner comments here and I can assure you that we are tired of wearing masks for a 12 hour shift. We are exhausted from donning PPE every time we go into a Covid room. We are tired of FaceTiming family members right before we intubate your family member. We are tired of watching your loved ones fight only to die. We are tired::: we are sick and tired of your callousness and putting us in harms way. We are sick and tired when you refuse vaccination but end up seeking us for healthcare. So for all that is holy::: get vaccinated. And if you can’t do that::: I’m sure you can tolerate a mask for an hour class. We do it all the time…for you.,Good. The honor system wasn’t working,Thank you for helping increase the chances that we can stay in person! Yay! Lower risks for all!,I’m in healthcare::: and I get the idea. But this should have been known up front. I paid regular tuition for a completely online class for my son. College isn’t a federal requirement. If we are paying the same tuition::: we expect in person classes. Not another year of my son not learning a damn thing. My Vaccinated son::: btw.,Thank you Clemson for doing everything you can to keep our Tigers on campus::: in person classes::: and normal (as possible) activities!! If we can’t get on board with masks::: then there won’t be a football season because too many positive tests will bench the whole team. It’s not about fear::: it’s about the common good and wanting what is best for everyone::: not just your personal opinions.,Not only online::: but mine has one that is online with pre-recorded lessons/videos and no actual class time. There isnt even a professor. it as asynchronous,Definitely the right decision that follows the science.,I just spent a week with my dad who was in AmMed hospital and the COVID-19 Delta variant cases were skyrocketing with admissions. we spent over 18 hours in the ER because there was not a bed available::: then had to move 2 times because they had to keep making more wings and floors COVID patients. It is real and it is real serious. We are also requiring masks at our business. I know it is a problem for some people who can't safely wear a mask::: and NO one loves it::: but I understand. My daughter is also in another college in NC and she has to wear a mask. She is grateful to finally be back to in person classes. If nurses and doctors who I promise are working their tails off- work 12 hr and sometimes longer shifts can wear a mask the whole time- I can.,Thank you! I am so glad Clemson did this! Hope it keeps them in school safely!,Proud of the University for doing the right thing. Also::: you guys need to keep the football team healthy so they can beat UGA!,How about professors suddenly changing their class format and saying they will be virtual because of Pickens County! My Sophomore has yet to step foot inside a building at Clemson since she started there last year and now today finds out all her classes are virtual AGAIN!!!,If wearing a piece of cloth on my face prevents one immunocompromis ed person from becoming ill::: I'll gladly continue to do it.,I paid 2 full tuition last year for online classes this is getting old if they are required to wear a mask in the building or anywhere on University grounds then the teachers that are teaching the classes need to teach in the classroom,This protects everyone! Thank you for doing the right thing::: which often is the best and hardest thing!,This is not ok. The percent positive rate is under 1%. It doesn't get much better than this. I've talked to multiple parents whose kids' classes are now suddenly online. Love how this happens after we pay our tuition. We already had a year of subpar education and we won't stand for another.,Thank you!!! This is awesome news. Protect our students::: educators::: and staff!! ❤️❤️❤️,This is NOT science - its about control,Three weeks? Who is going to believe that? You all know that you are going to extend it just like they did when they tried to “flatten the curve”,This goes totally against what the governor ordered,So proud of my alma mater. Now I wonder if we’re still going to have games in Death Valley at full capacity!,Thank you for doing the right thing::: Clemson!,It’s three weeks people! If these kids can’t do something for 3 weeks..:::,Nice! Genuinely didn't believe it would happen.  Now do vaccines,Thank You! It is really for the best to go with this approach.,If you are or would be considerate and compassionate of Others’ well being . ..consider vaccination!! Most ( all) college level students are now eligible to receive vaccination … Other types of vaccination is required for all school- aged children ::: including college students… Why not make this one mandatory as well?,Fifteen days to slow the curve! 😀,If your kids are eligible and aren’t vaccinated::: then they are the reason why the school had to consider action.,Teachers got what they wanted. Now what’s the excuse for online classes ??? Do you need the students to wear 2 masks? This is ridiculous. My sophomore has had ZERO in person classes. Just remember these students are the next generation. How did you learn your profession? Online??? TEACH OUR KIDS. THEY ARE BEGGING FOR A TEACHER THAT CARES. Why do students come to college to sit in their rooms online? All you saying great job why are the majority of you pictured on Facebook with no masks at move in. Were you not scared 3 days ago? The professor who organized the “walk out” to get the University to mandate masks was also inviting the public to join her for open mic at the local brewery. Obviously this is all political but please just shut up and give our kids an education.,Every parent paying tuition should demand toxicology reports for all teachers::: as well as background checks::: and immunization records.,What is the university going to do about the sudden new mask mandate? My daughter doesn't have one. Will the university be supplying them now?,Come on Clemson! Nice that you did this after tuition was paid !,Then ALL professors should be back in the classroom! I have been in my SC classroom all last year and again this year there is no reason why college professors are not back in the classroom! My child has not had one in-person class in 3 1/2semesters at Clemson! I am ok with masks… but then ALL professors need to be in the classroom!,So are they enforcing this at football games? Or does covid not spread at football games?,This is a bad look after tuition has been paid and students moved in. Classes start *tomorrow* and you're pulling a switch on these students *the night before*?  This is terrible.,Since he caved to the teachers threatening to boycott tomorrow::: they better be in class teaching our kids in person!,😮I sincerely hope they yank all state funding from the school Parents and students alike... 💯Demand your tuition be refunded-\-\- you are not getting the services you were told would be provided::: and everyone learns differently 🛑Some kids cant comprehend virtually They need face to face or hands on interaction I have provided Gov McMasters information below ⭐Reach out to his office with your concerns of the school going against his order,Man better not screw with our football season. Don't start this crap now. I swear I will relinquish my IPTAY membership.,I say do what you have to to protect our Tiger!!,Withdrawal and sue for refunds. Teachers lose jobs::: university takes a hit fiscally and then they feel what many people just talk about.  It’s just a Facebook comment at this point till you take action. But most won’t,Shocker. Just a meer 24 hours after the Professors planned a staged walkout. These Professors better be working overtime for the half ass instruction they gave to these students over the last year and a half.”,Still have an online class and why was the vaccine damn near a requirement? This is getting old clemson,Thank you for doing the right thing::: Clemson. Now::: require vaccination or ban the unvaccinated from attending social and sporting events! We want to be in person and the inconsiderate individuals refusing to do something as simple as mask up are causing that to come into question!,“Until they become conscious they will never rebel::: and until after they have rebelled they cannot become conscious” - George Orwell 1984.,Once again caving to teachers who are far over paid!!!!!! 😡,USC had to pull the mandate the Attorney General came to the school and told them they could recommend it not mandate.,I love how you wait until everyone has paid the bill::: signed leases and moved in. This is absolutely ridiculous.,Thank you for using your education to do what is right for students::: faculty::: staff::: and our state.,I cannot believe there are people who reacted with the angry emoji at this. You are angry that the university is implementing something that will help keep people from spreading Covid?,Thank you Clemson U for making the health of students::: staff and faculty the priority.,Tyranny posed as science,It’s about time::: no one wants all our professors and their kids to get sick because we college students are pretending like COVID doesn’t exist. Also::: I REALLY don’t want to have to go online again. I learned nothing the whole time. If I have to wear a mask in campus class to prevent that from happening again::: I will without complaint.,all of the students should walk out tomorrow in protest.,Well::: the order from the SC Supreme Court states that the power to pass legislation stopping this mandate is within the power of the state legislature by wording it correctly. Ball is in your court Governor….what say you?,I don't mind::: I'm a MBA student who also did 3 semesters virtually during my junior & senior year at Clemson. At this point::: it is what it is::: it's only a temporary 3 weeks for crying out loud. I don't care if we're virtual or in person because either way::: I will do whatever it takes to get my money's worth. More work is done outside the classroom than inside anyways::: class time is only to recap what we do OUTSIDE the classroom. Let's just make it through these next few weeks and agree to disagree.,Yes::: except I just went to a class where the professor kept his mask around his chin the whole time and many students were not wearing them. The mandate won’t do anything nor will it be temporary if we don’t actually listen to and enforce it.,This is 100% the right thing to do. Thank you for making your university and your city a better place.,That should have been decided prior to students paying their tuition and moving into dorms::: etc. The no mask policy they had at the beginning of the semester should be binding until the end of the semester.,This is wrong should be students choice.,Diehard Clemson loyalists::: but agree with you 100%. My oldest is now into year two of college and learned just about nothing online his first year. The computer along with classmates::: and us as parents are the ones who taught him. Not the school. Would love to know what money went where Bc this was a waste.,Masks can be worn but don’t make classes ONLINE!!!!,What about the 80000 in the stadium?,It's ironic that it's 3 weeks till kickoff.,Next year when Clemson looks for funding from the legislature don’t be surprised. Grab the popcorn people.,Glad my 2 oldest have graduated & done! Best of luck parents! Glad my youngest is in private school! No mote of this mess,Scared people are always disappointing.,Are the weekly COVID tests stopping?,which will become three months.... and then on and on.,This comment section did NOT pass the vibe check lol,Whatever it takes to keep it open/in-person and keep people well!,Please do some research other than ABC:::NBC:::CBS:::and CNN,Clemson better not go virtual or I will be planning a tuition walkout!,Please clarify policy for professors to he allowed clear face shields while at the podium.,Better safe than sorry! 😷,This is really getting annoying.,I guess they will lift it for football in the Valley,I don’t agree with this decision.,Nope. There is no way this is happening.,For three weeks? 😂😂😂  Note for everyone around or attending Clemson University your compliance is why this will never end. Freedoms are never given back. They are only taken away until you take them back by force.,Dana Childs Mumaw get him a 3M half mask with cartridge filters😁,Stop this nonsense!!! In Australia they are now in Lockdown level 4 like Marshall law …. Can’t take mask off in public even to have a drink. And are pulling children from the homes in the name of “being Covid risks” and placing them in detainment centers ?!!!! Are you kidding me?!!! It’s happening folks !!! It’s insane and the only way to stop it from getting this way here is to not comply.,"So Warp Speed failed because Delta was stronger making those who call those anti-vaxxers by default::: ""lab rats.""😏",Biden and his CDC will be shutting down football season soon::: Carolina will be saved again😡,Jus like the beginning jus shut down for two weeks over a year later ::: nothing but the overreaching government,AWESOME!!! Now please don’t let USC beat you again.,What's wrong with that? can't do that in Florida stupid Ron DeSantis,Only way to stop this is to not comply by the numbers this is absolutely disgusting... #ourbodiesourcho ice,Thank you!,I would like to say a few words.  1) I have been a proponent of doing whatever was necessary to get back to an actual normal since the CDC started putting out guidelines shy of wanting mandatory vaccines as that is highly immoral and unethical.  2) I feel sorry that nurses have to deal with the crap that comes with this. Unfortunately you do work in the healthcare industry and that is part of the territory and before I see something about walking a mile in their shoes::: the plant I work in requires a face mask work boots::: safety glasses::: long heavy pants::: and sometimes fire retardant and that’s if you don’t work in paint for twelve hour shifts in barely air conditioned or ventilated floor space while using heavy machinery and performing robust work. I also don’t think someone should go to the doctor let alone ER unless they have conditions or difficulty breathing. And I have lost three grandparents since 2018::: as well as a slew of other close relatives and family friends in my short lifetime so I don’t want to hear how tired you are of watching people die::: I’ve seen too many of my own family die to much more painful and slow diseases.  3) no one should care more about their own health than you. Safety starts with the individual. If you want to catch a bug then so be it as long as you embrace the consequences. If I get the bug from not wearing a mask then I will quarantine and probably won’t even get tested or see a doctor until I am better. Which I am vaccinated. Ultimately with weekly (high false positive) testing I will know quickly if I get it and am not opposed to biweekly testing if that means I don’t have to wear a mask. I wouldn’t be as upset if I hadn’t been lied to because they sure announced a pretty little plan as soon as the SCSC made the ruling (as in hours).  4) if the faculty are doing this on my behalf and self interest::: I sure don’t remember being asked how I felt about it. I don’t remember being asked how I felt my out of state tuition should be used. I don’t remember anyone seeing if it was OK to alter a service from a PUBLIC university and give no assurances if I would even have in person classes the whole semester. I’m in engineering::: do you really want your next airplane signed off by a guy w an online degree who never had actual conversations with engineers and has a minimal grasp on the concepts because grading is easier and learning is harder.  5) let me also say this::: anyone on Clemson’s board who says they care about our health and education is lying. They care about their image and money::: I (we) as a student are just a number to the higher ups next to a dollar sign. If they cared::: they would have shut down the school. If they cared they would have only online at a reduced tuition. If they cared they wouldn’t have the dining halls open. If they cared they would have shut down the buses. If they cared they would have at least hired a company to disinfect each classroom after a class. If they truly cared about our health and well-being they would think about how much more likely depression and suicide has been since all this started. If they cared they would be much more active in reducing student deaths and health issues from underage drinking::: nicotine use::: drug use and other issues that have a higher likely of occurring and of killing than a disease which is less deadly and likely than a car wreck (which I have also been in as a child),Let’s keep this in perspective. Shared from someone who has dealt with past pandemics that weren’t used as a political tool. “Just took a peak at the covid dashboard and compared it to this same time last year. Last year the week was sitting at 4.2% positive rate. The same week this year is at .9%. Also the cases in employees started to rise PRIOR to in person instruction::: so let's not let them forget that either - their current positivity rate is higher than students at 1.4%. In addition::: an important number we measure when tracking pandemics is the Reproductive number or the Rt. So that Clemson can't say that masks caused the decline::: look at the chart below. Pickens County is below 1 which means we will shortly see a decline in cases - we are probably within a week or so of hitting summer peak. The Rt for SC as a whole is .96. Make sure Clemson remembers this so they don't try to tie it to mask wearing. There will be another peak in Fall/Winter so they need to learn to live with it. Flood them with data because they aren't providing it to us!”Just took a peak at the covid dashboard and compared it to this same time last year. Last year the week was sitting at 4.2% positive rate.

Chill out sheep,You mask people make me vomit,Pointless,STOP THE MADNESS.,The U.S. death toll from the pandemic is now 623:::000 people::: the highest number of deaths officially reported by any country in the world. https:// www.reuters.com/ world/us/ us-reports-more- than-1000-covid -deaths-single- day-2021-08-18/,Amy Amy Stuck Shealy,Trash,So very glad to see this ….,Agreed Rhonda!,🤬,AWESOME AND THANK YOU! GO TIGERS 🐯,Julian Munn Sappho Charney,Elizabeth Jolley,What a disgrace. This is the sorry state of higher education in 2021. No science backs up this mandate. None. In fact::: science dictates no face covering. Sars-CoV 2 is 0.12 microns. The best a surgical mask can do is stop particles as small at 0.3 microns. Cloth masks do not stop contagion and particles from all masks can dislodge and embed in lung tissue where they can cause disease now and in the future. All masks impede the flow of oxygen and carbon dioxide and hold pathogenic bacteria against the face where they multiply and can sicken the weakened (by masking) wearer. You are supposed to be teaching the students how to think and the right way of doing things. This is beyond disgusting. Dangerous ignorance.,Well put,So glad I’m done with this mess of a university  The virtue signaling it does on a daily basis was ridiculous before Covid... forget about it now lol  Cloth Masks (what everyone is wearing around) have been proven to not do the job you people think it does.  The vaccine does not stop the spread::: symptoms and even death. It’s not a vaccine at that point::: it’s a therapeutic.  But I’m sure I will get bombarded with people who claim to be free::: independent thinkers yet are quite the opposite... for simply looking at this differently 🤷‍♂️,https:// www.change.org/ p/ clemson-universi ty-reverse-mask -mandate?recrui ter=923292252&u tm_source=share _petition&utm_m edium=sms&utm_c ampaign=psf_com bo_share_initia l&utm_term=tap_ basic_share&rec ruited_by_id=76 20b970-ff9b-11e 8-b7f2-dfebf5b8 3c3a,Jay Mac 👏🏽,I hope the students never believe another thing one of these school officials says...they have no interest in what’s best for their students...this is all just part of Team Corona. 🤯 // oh::: will you report many of us here to Joe Biden as Domestic Terrorists?,You are so ridiculous. Everyone know we are already on the downslide of this recent spike. Then in 3 weeks you’ll say::: “see::: the masks work.” We are on to your schemes. BTW::: even the leftist magazine The Atlantic says “live with it” when it comes to this overblown virus. https:// www.theatlantic. com/science/ archive/2021/08/ how-we-live-coro navirus-forever /619783/,Aaron Black you believe that? Lol,Demand refunds!!,J,I miss old Clemson,Annika Hardy,Marla Dene Deitz,Great move!,Shame on you.,👎👎👎,The only mask that works is the N95 and it’s in the 70 percentile. The others were in the 20+. They don’t work!,Madi boyd,Ro Martinez,This is ridiculous! Masks don’t do anything…. Do your research! People who want to wear one should if they think it will “keep them safe”…. But not the ones who know that they don’t work. You’re better to focus on better nutrition::: better sleep::: vitamins and supplements::: maybe workout and sweat out toxins! You’re responsible for yourself not everyone else.,Bye bye Clemson games,Emma Brown,Richard Goldthwaite,This is a no for me.,Masks don’t work! Do some research many studies out there! Many children in Europe are not being masked.,Ya'll need to get this under control....it's going to get worse...we have suffered in Canada with masks orders and many regulations that finally have our numbers way down to where we are almost at normal...I told my doctor I was coming to Clemson for Homecoming and then to Syracuse ..which is 3 hours from me...he strongly recommended against it because of your numbers in USA...see ya'll next year..stay safe my Tiger Brothers and Sisters,GOOD CALL,Great job Clemson!! 🧡💜,Thank You!,Three weeks to flatten the curve 🤦‍♂️👎🏻,Here we go again......,Great,Stop virtue signaling!!!,bunch of libs,Michelle McClelland TotherowSusan White Trenton White,15 days…,Macey Coulter,Such BS. You caved.,Cassi Bowen 👀👀🙌🙌🙌,Are you requiring N 95 filtration masks? If not then you’re being a very non-scientific university. Pissing in the ocean and hoping the water will rise,It is not surprising to me with the rising trend in COVID cases NATIONWIDE that Clemson is taking the precaution to require masks. I still mask anywhere I go in public even though I have been fully vaccinated for 4 months. Vaccines aren't perfect::: but they have been shown to mitigate the severity of disease if it develops in a vaccinated individual. Vaccinated individuals can carry and shed virus and still be asymptomatic. I don't know if I might be carrying the virus at any given time::: and I want to do my part to protect others. I also want to do what I can to keep from being exposed. Following is an article that discusses about vaccinated persons and the Delta variant. https:// www.tampabay.com /opinion/2021/ 08/10/ what-we-now-know -about-how-to-f ight-the-delta- variant-of-covi d-column/ ?fbclid=IwAR0Zw3 Gj5TBiD8-ePmx3x VvTEYrCsIKaW4k_ qp-lOrRbg0kD_tG uNs8wf-8,Thank you.,State Law states that masks are optional. When are you going to let these kids go back to normal living? They are suffering far greater consequences. My Clemson son went into a state of depression after being stuck in the Sykes engineering dorm last year with no activities and no outlet and studying 10 hours a day. Why Clemson? Why go to the politically correct route? Especially when science says masks do nothing to protect.,https:// twitter.com/ tbl47/status/ 1427788601908244 486?s=21,https:// www.rodefshalom6 13.org/2020/10/ are-face-masks-e ffective-what-s tudies-show/  Masks don’t work.,Thank you for keeping our children safe!,"This mask obsssesion has got to stop . Unless you're changing it after every in person encounter it's useless . Well it's useless against viruses anyways . It only gives a false sense of security and makes people touch their faces more .

Weak.,Mask don’t work,This has got to stop,Complete and TOTAL joke,Ashamed to be a Tiger at this moment. The board::: the president::: all decision makers are the lowest of liars. You tricked us again into paying tuition then flip flopping like the slimy fishes you are. Disgusting::: lying sheeple every one of you. Clemson no longer stands tall::: they cave and clamor to elites and their demands. Makes me want to🤢🤮 Teachers whimper and whine whilst enjoying full pay for minimal work while our kids suffer.

University officials have announced the plan for full-capacity operations for the 2021-2022 academic year. The University will continue to monitor the COVID-19 environment and provide updates as necessary.  CLEMSON.EDU Plans Announced for Fully Operational Fall Semester,2021-08-04 16:55:45,"I applaud Clemson for returning to full operational status::: but I question the decision to do weekly testing of the entire student population. Students who are fully vaccinated should be exempt from the weekly testing requirement and should only have to test if they are contact traced and have a potential known exposure identified. Full testing of the population is a waste of time and resources. Our son is fully vaccinated and we are sending him to Clemson for the on-campus and in-person education and experience. I have no concerns about the protocols outlined in the ""full operational status""::: other than the weekly testing requirement.",How will you enforce testing? You can’t restrict access to buildings during the day when all the students are on campus.,Doesn’t Clemson have a science department? SC is in the top 10 of the most COVID-infected states and you “strongly encourage” vaccines::: “strongly recommend” face masks and have given up on social distancing completely?? Last year wasn’t even a full year of in-person instruction and CU was one of the worst universities for infections. Shame on you - do more to protect your students::: faculty and staff.,I’d rather have my son tested weekly if that means he can go to in person classes. Last year was horrible.,Very welcome after an entirely remote year last year. Looking forward to it!,Proud of Clemson for not mandating face masks and an experimental vaccine!! 👏👏,Clemson University Class Rings::: Yearbooks & Graduation https://bit.ly/ 3ioQMwN,God bless Clemson and everyone do their part to make it work,My husband literally just had meetings cancelled on campus for this Friday due to high Covid numbers… So::: what’s the real procedure?,In a completely unrelated story::: 75% of students at U of SC request transfer paperwork::: and once again all were denied admission.,Require vaccination and spare us the trouble. After-the-fact testing just puts everybody at risk. https:// www.clemson.edu/ campus-life/ student-health/ medical/ services-and-dep artments/ immunizations-an d-allergy-injec tions.html https:// www.npr.org/ 2021/07/19/ 1018010489/ indiana-universi tys-vaccine-req uirement-should -stand-federal- judge-rules,STAY SAFE. DO WHAT IT TAKES !,Their plan basically says..we don’t really care about students::: faculty::: staff …just the money we can get by being ‘open’ and by using them to the full extent.,Cannot wait to be back on campus and get the quality education I pay for!,Better rethink this decision. Across 38 states::: there have been at least 125:::000 fully vaccinated Americans that have tested positive for COVID-19. These ‘breakthrough’ cases have resulted in 1:::400 deaths.,Go Clemson!,Hard times with difficult decisions.,As a Clemson alum I am happy to see this. A fully operational::: 'normal' college experience is the only thing I would pay (hefty) out of state tuition for.  Hoping for a great fall semester for everyone.,Whatever it takes to get kids in classroom for the face to face learning they need and we are paying for! Clemson did a great job identifying asymptotic students with the required testing last year when most universities sent the kids home!,I am so looking forward to some normalcy on campus!,Mónica Toledo,"full-capacity operations yet the ""CDC experts"" and our trusty government officials are telling us that Delta is worse then the original. Who's smoking what?",My father has been in the hospital for 2 weeks now with Covid-19. We’ve continuously heard how he’s not going to make it how he may make it and how he has an 80% mortality rate. We should not be going back with no regulations or anything. This is asking for a disaster. As a Clemson student I am very disappointed in the lack of leadership the upper administration has shown.,But will Clemson stay fully functional? The weekly testing just opens the door to more restrictions::: IMO.,So happy to see that Clemson didn’t bother trying to mandate vaccines or masks! Weekly testing of healthy people is ridiculous though.,What I don’t see addressed is how positive cases will be handled. Will students be required to quarantine? Will there be a procedure in place to help them stay current on class work if so?,Awesome!!!!!! Now just don’t get any ideas about masking::: testing or vaccinating the students or faculty….state legislation does not allow any of that being mandatory to any public institution.,Yay!!! All in person classes::: I hope! These kids need to get back in the classrooms and labs and actually get what we’re paying for!,DO NOT REQUIRE VAX TO ATTEND! I’m a Tiger grad::: but I will watch you fall if you pull that crud.,What happens if you have a positive test result but you been vaccinated and you have no symptoms? Quarantine?,Go Tigers! Thank you Clemson University for taking a pragmatic approach that balances the compelling need for students to return to normalcy and personal responsibility for well-being.,Seems like a train wreck! We shall see,It’s not the school’s fault. It’s the stupid governor’s mandates that is tying the school’s hands.,👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼🧡💜,👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻,Hallelujah! I have 2 grandchildren there and I know they will be so relieved.,weekly testing of vaccinated is ridiculous,So happy to hear this! Thank you!!!,Y’all please be careful,Ro Martinez,Elizabeth Taylor Ellis I completely agree with you!,Is there a saliva test available so the nasal swab that can injure your sinus cavities can be avoided? I can’t imagine ongoing weekly nasal swabs. These tests aren’t even accurate!,After youve seen it full of bubble bath::: its just never the same again.,YES!!!!! Thank you!!!!!!!,Thank you- thank you!!,Weekly testing is ridiculous,Nice that it’s fully operational::: but why weekly testing for vaccinated students. What was the point of getting vaccinated if you still have to get tested WEEKLY!! Jimmy grab a set and don’t be like the rest of your liberal academia presidents.,I am so happy to hear this !,98 percent survival rate..,Clemson is doing a great job given the constraints created by the unwise ideological resistance of state leadership to vaccine mandates and mask mandates. Delta variant is far more communicable... a whole new ball game... and I hope Henry McMaster wakes up to that reality.,This ain't it 🤦,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on guidance from the CDC and DHEC::: University officials have announced changes to face covering and testing requirements.  GO.TIG.RS University updates face covering and testing requirements.,2021-05-21 16:35:28,Thankful I won't be required to test weekly::: since I'm vaccinated. Hopeful this approach protects the vulnerable in our community-\-\a community filled with people of all ages::: not just students. There are plenty of staff & faculty who may not be able to vaccinate and are vulnerable::: and they deserve the right to work in a safe environment. Just as there are students in similar situations. If this encourages more people to vaccinate::: then great.  The absolute worst outcome for all of us would be a return to online learning as a result of a resurgence in the virus within the community. Such an outcome would be devastating.,Just wondering and am not wanting a debate...It is up to individuals whether or not you want the vaccine::: but what about those who have had Covid?! All you hear about is.. if you are vaccinated you don't have to do this or that..the majority of people who have had it are not dead... contrary to media portrayal. Covid survivors are never considered in any of the conversations I've seen...,I would like for Clemson to reconsider and end the mask mandate completely. It will cause students that choose not to get the vaccine to be subject to ridicule.,End the mask mandate completely.,Stop requiring mask for people that don't want to wear one . If you want to wear a mask that should be your choice and if you think someone else should wear one then wear one or two if you want.,As a Clemson grad...I'm grateful my daughters have absolutely no desire to go to Clemson. This is absolutely insane! Feel free to watch this video::: Clemson admins::: to help you come to your senses! https:// www.instagram.co m/tv/ CO8P3LgpyXU/ ?utm_medium=copy _link,This is not based on CDC or our Governors order. This is ridiculous! So disappointing to see a SC university so determined to instill fear! I pray that those with authority will be blessed with sound reasoning::: set aside their fear and ego::: and do what is right.,Clemson is an education facility nothing more therefore you don't have the right to dictate who gets vaccinated and who doesn't. You need to reconsider this policy. I don't pay you to dictate what my adult child decides to do concerning his own body. So disappointing especially from a University that claims to be so smart!! The alumni should consider withdrawing funds that may help you reconsider.,South Carolina is against tyranny. We stand for Freedom.,There should be no differences between vaccinated or unvaccinated individuals! No masks::: no testing period!! At this point::: everyone needs to manage their own risks!,Thank you Clemson!!!! Thank you for getting our kids back on campus and keeping them safe!!!,Is this even legal? What about my right to privacy when it comes to health matters? What about discrimination against those that choose NOT to get the untested vaccine? We have been more than patient and compliant with Clemson. It is time to get back to normal and allow our students to have a normal college experience.,Any good attorneys on here itching for a fight? I'll chip in to the #freeclemsonstud ents-from-administr ative-tyranny fund.,How about some consideration for students that have had the virus? They shouldn’t need a vaccine and shouldn’t have to test weekly. Antibodies..... ..,Legit question. Not looking for controversy or inquiries on my student’s situation Does anyone know who to contact in regards to questions regarding this decision. I just need a couple of answers to an unusual situation and have spent an hour and half on the phone today being transferred all over to different departments. I’m frustrated no one can suggest who to contact::: they just keep transferring me. . Any phone numbers or emails in connection to this news release ?,Ridiculous!!!!! As a Clemson grad I’m disgusted that this school would push the vaccine on students. These kids feel they must get vaccinated in order to have a life. STOP this INSANITY NOW!!!!! This is an experimental vaccine. Who knows what it will do to them! My daughter graduated last year and spent the year there teaching lab. They had to get tested every week. At first it was the nasal test which I was furious about. Then it was the spit test. This is so ridiculous! Less that 1% of students even tested positive this spring and this age group has a greater than 99% survival rate. The school is all fine with having a full stadium of 85:::000 football fans on Saturdays in the fall but wants to force this on the students. Follow the money. The students have to pay tuition so they’ll push this on them because they can control them. If they tried this with football fans they’d loose hundreds of thousands of dollars. STAND UP FOR OUR STUDENTS RIGHTS!,Not everyone has the same situation- I respect everyones decision regardless of what it is - I remain unvaccinated as it poses a larger health risk for me::: with the unknown side effects and my current health conditions So::: I guess I'm treated differently because of my prior health problems Thats nice Glad I'm not a student,Sounds like a great plan to me. If you do not want to vaccinate you should still get tested and wear a mask. You are still just as likely to get or spread covid,Sounds fair::: my other children are at the University of Delaware and Rutgers::: vaccines are mandated for all if they want to dorm or be in campus. This spring students tested every week and wore masks. Why should unvaccinated not continue to test/wear masks? Their circumstances haven’t changed::: they are still just as likely to spread covid. Those who are vaccinated aren’t a danger of spreading covid::: no need for testing or masks. If cases go up::: things shut down::: everybody loses.,I’m glad my program is online::: but I’m disappointed to see Clemson take this step.,Did any of you turn into Clemson your student’s vaccination records and physical form for them to live on campus? It was required. 🤦‍♀️ You didn’t question them then.,I think it will all work out. For all we know the vaccinated will need booster shots and we will all be wearing masks again while waiting for booster shots. So your unvaccinated kids won’t be singled out and be the only ones wearing masks.,Didn’t the South Carolina Governor McMaster issue an executive order banning having to show proof of vaccination by state agencies?,Maybe these suddenly scared professors can get ALL 3 vaccines.,It’s public knowledge that Clemson University is in the vaccine packaging business https:// www.scbio.org/ cpages/home,We need you to announce graduation at LJC in August now 👀,It is unethical to bully students into complying with this just so you can virtue signal::: Clemson University.,You folks running this college should be jailed and never be allowed near a learning institution again.,This is ridiculous to require young people to have this experimental vaccine! Tyranny reins on our college campuses in America! I hope enrollment plummets. Money talks!,Segregation & discrimination. Plain and simple.,Where there is risk there must always be choice! We are in SC not a blue state !,Anybody that wants a Clemson degree or two that doesn’t want to follow this coerced consent lmk  I’ll send you an undergrad and masters and you can have your degree and never have to set foot on that shit hole again  Change the name and then realize it’s as worthless as the paper it’s written on.  Beyond Disappointed in Clements and company,#freeclemsonstud ents also would have thought people who worked there were smart? Hmm,Simply not happy with this- ‘Clemson Mom,For anyone interested in attending a Healthcare Freedom Rally at Clemson: https://fb.me/ e/1tqDXcIDa,How many times will this change prior to Fall?,Pushing students to get an experimental vaccine when they have little to no chance of having significant impact from COVID doesn't make sense to many people-Many students have already had COVID::: they knew it and it was documented-many had it never knew it and it was never documented-Vacc inated students can get and spread COVID-It's simple-rules are being written to discriminate against students who choose not to participate in an experimental vaccine program-The benefit to them doesn't outweigh the risk of COVID for the majority-The bottom line is it's a choice for which no student should be penalized for-,The list of demands coming from teachers and schools are becoming ridiculous. Every other occupation still working. Teachers want our students to get a vaccine not even approved so THEY feel safe. Teachers want students to cover their face and not receive proper oxygen so THEY feel safe. Because we can’t all stay at home and home school our ( younger ) kids jobs have been lost so THEY feel safe. Less than 2% of our population effected by this virus. Move on. Don’t make your fears mine. I’m so over this 💩 teachers can wear 2 masks & gloves .. my kids is not getting the jab,"A Clemson student has a higher chance of contracting influenza or meningitis on campus right now than COVID-19. The infection rate will never go down to zero even with weekly testing with false positives factored in. This is ludicrous. So few college students are being hospitalized or dying of this virus that I could only find six in the whole country in a Google search. Unmask them::: let them learn::: let them communicate properly. Lift the heavy hand of this oppression and let them be actual college students. We're paying a lot of money to send our children there::: only to watch draconian measure after draconian measure enforced in the name of ""safety."" Let the professors get their vaccines and double mask all they want. But set our kids FREE.",According to the CDC and Dr. Fauci this vaccine is not FDA approved. It is for emergency use.  Dr. Amanda Cohn::: executive secretary of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices::: was asked if COVID-19 vaccination can be required. Dr. Cohn responded that under an EUA::: “vaccines are not allowed to be mandatory. So::: early in this vaccination phase::: individuals will have to be consented [sic] and they won’t be able to be mandatory.”  https:// www.thedesertrev iew.com/health/ experimental-cov id-shots-cannot -be-mandated/ article_89b901ae -8126-11eb-a78d -07c0c7e926df.h tml,The vaccine is being tested on all who take it. How is this legal? I do t feel comfortable at all about the “healthy Clemson”,Even better than Annie though I’m 100 times a fan,This is not ok! This is coerced consent and promotes shaming and discrimination!   Forcing students ((who choose not to participate in an experimental treatment)) to wear a mask and test::: will single them out::: infringe on their medical privacy::: will invite others to discriminate and worse::: takes away their ability to participate in activities like everyone else.  How is this FREE??? I thought we were becoming a nation of equality??? As a minority this is the one thing I fight for - removal of all labeling and respecting civil rights.  The vaccine does not stop transmission and it’s still being tested for safety.  This is a terrible idea!!  Consider your policy!,Association of American Physicians and Surgeons wrote colleges asking them: “…to reconsider your new policy mandating COVID-19 vaccination of students prior to returning to campus..” “…There are multiple reasons to reverse your policy… 1. Young adults are a healthy and immunologically competent and vibrant group that is at::: “extraordinary low risk for COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.”[iv] 2. College and University students::: however::: are under significant mental health strain already from COVID-19 fears::: circumstances::: distance learning problems and the imposition of government health policy restrictions.[v ] 3. Even though the FDA granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for three COVID-19 vaccines::: they are not FDA approved to treat::: cure or prevent any disease at this time. Clinical trials will continue for at least two years before the FDA can even consider approval of these vaccines as effective and safe….”  https:// aapsonline.org/ open-letter-from -physicians-to- universities-re verse-covid-vac cine-mandates/ ?fbclid=IwAR2D7S cSvItNSRDbcyUMO pmL9mtxl9N9CZKc 9d0DDK2ZCdOVCg1 boIh3XnY,Here's some science for Clemson's administration who can't seem to understand how natural immunity works. And there's a humdinger deep in this article: SARS CoV-1 patients from 18 years ago are still showing strong immunity. In case you don't know::: COVID-19 is SARS CoV-2. Almost exactly the same. You couldn't pay me any amount of money to inject me or my child with a vaccine with an unproven safety record when we are rocking natural immunity. https:// science.sciencem ag.org/content/ 371/6529/ eabf4063,"""The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is looking into reports that a very small number of teenagers and young adults vaccinated against the coronavirus may have experienced heart problems::: The New York Times reported on Saturday::: citing the agency's vaccine safety group.""

If you trust the all knowing CDC why in the name of all that is sane would the people that are vaccinated not be perfectly fine with non vaccinated? According the CDC vaccinations protect us. So for the miniscule teeninsy percent of vaccinated that may not be protected thousands of kids will be singled out for thier choice. Why make non vaxxers mask when those who worry are protected!! Vaxxers should be masked - yall are walking around self injected with this virus!!  All logic is gone from this scenario. Shame on you Clemson. You are bullying kids to make a choice by basically making them wear the star of David (mask) shaming them for choosing a different path.  Clemson you hugely disappoint. Makes me sick and disgusted with your whole system.  Ever heard the saying ""my body my choice"" guess that only applies when its convenient huh.

Science data says mask dont work and does more harm. Test creator said test are not accurate. CDC stated that Covid has a 99% recovery rate and that only 6% of the Covid deaths recorded were only true covid deaths.

He buried his chances when Dabo said the Heisman would be honored to put Trevor's name on it. You can't force that. Blame Dabo. 100 percent. Watch....next season we are going to be eaten alive. Dabo isn't the same. Now he's win hungry::: eating his own words when we barely one that game last season and he chewed everyone up about it. Take this to the bank::: the Tigers are going to be ruined now till Dabo either reverts back to ambition or he leaves clemson.,Best QB in the nation. The Heisman Trophy is nothing but a stat/bias award.,This young man is an incredible leader and role model for all Tigers and all young people everywhere.,For some reason the committee don't like Clemson we had two great quarterbacks should have won the Heisman hands down good luck to you Trevor do the same thing Watson did when you get to the pros this is from a real CLEMSON TIGER'S FAN,Love you Trevor.

Its rumored that using resources outside the game to figure out the plays going to be run against them is part of the standard football team practices.  Is this behavior acceptable for students as well? I am sure that students would do well if they could know the questions on their exams before the teachers run the tests.

They wore their masks::: social distanced::: used hand sanitizer::: got tested and quarantined when necessary. As the semester went on::: she knew she would have to stay true to her word.

After careful consideration::: University leadership has made the decision to revert to online-only instruction following the Thanksgiving holiday for the final two weeks of the Fall semester.  The final day of in-person instruction will be Tuesday::: November 24th.  NEWSSTAND.CLEMSON.EDU Online-only instruction following Thanksgiving holiday,2020-10-22 21:04:41,My Niece Attends College At Clemson; And::: This Is Her Final Semester.  Nurse Mathews Has Officially Obtained Her Degree!,My son is a 3rd year Engineering student and has been on campus 2 times the entire semester. Even his 2 labs::: which should be hands on::: are being held virtually. Meanwhile::: his little brother has been in class 5 days a week in a SC elementary school since early September with 0 issues.,What about the graduations?,Great!,I guess you guys better refund some of the ridiculous tuition you charge to these kids as well as housing and meals,Expensive choice for online education.,I know online classes are overwhelming on students and teachers! I really::: really hope for in-person classes in the spring! This online cannot continue!,So there will be a housing and meal plan refund forthcoming I would assume...,Thank you for making difficult decisions that are best for the students::: faculty::: and staff. All In!,I just talked to my son and he is seriously struggling with the online classes and ready to drop-out. I am very worried about him. He was so happy to move back to campus thinking he was going to get some in person classes and now it is all online and he is overwhelmed. He cruised through classes last year with no problems! Very disappointed!,So is COVID on the rise at Clemson?,All but one of my student’s professors opted to provide instruction online-only this semester anyway after we paid for a legit university experience.,I get it....maybe offer testing to all students before returning to campus whenever that is.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A new era of business education is beginning at Clemson University with a transformational $60 million gift —the largest in University history —from Wilbur O. “Billy” and Ann Powers.  With its signature programs and a new::: best-in-class facility::: the newly named Wilbur O. and Ann Powers College of Business is positioned to equip students with the skills::: knowledge and values to thrive and make an impact in the dynamic global economy.  http://go.tig.rs/znaxay,2020-10-16 15:45:10,I think it’s innovative and reflective of a forward looking program that can respect the past while facing forward in a dynamic environment!,The generosity of this family is appreciated! I look forward to our soph tiger benefitting from these facilities as he pursues his finance degree.,Tuition will continue to skyrocket::: student suicide and substance abuse will continue to increase::: football will still be prioritized above all else and Clemson will continue to be catered to the most privileged and the most affluent demographic. This university has changed. While it might look pretty from the outside; the experience as a non-traditional student is honestly embarrassing.  Clemson has never fully supported student veterans::: yet you use us for promotional bits and have a few folks “leading” those veterans that completely lack a spine. Totally afraid to stand up and do the right thing::: or just unwilling to say the difficult things to their superiors and attempt progress. The only thing our university is known for is football. We need to change that before it is too late. Those rings::: trophies and banners might look pretty; but they won’t make 99.9% of the student population (who aren’t going to the NFL) more productive members of society. 🧠 > 💵,Welcome to the WAP College of Business,This is sad...so many of great organizations that could really use this but giving to a college that is already full of money😢,Keep Clemson open by voting for new leadership. https:// www.wsj.com/ articles/ more-than-1-000- current-and-for mer-cdc-officer s-condemn-u-s-c ovid-19-respons e-11602884265?m od=hp_lead_pos5,Wow!!,When is somebody going to invest in the College of Engineering? It is one of the biggest draws to the school and they have some of the crappiest facilities.,Such an amazing::: generous gift! Thank you to the Powers family!,Well that certainly changed the look and feel of campus. I am grateful for the gift::: and it looks like an amazing building but I wish it could have built somewhere else on campus.,Ashley Sims,I loved Sirrine Hall. Proud to have been there as a finance major. I certainly appreciate the investment in the future of business. I certainly benefitted from my education there. Go Tigers!!!,Billy Powers is the most generous::: caring and nicest man I have ever known. Our family has been blessed to know him and call him a dear friend and mentor for 40+ years. His devotion to Clemson University and the education of young people has always been evident and I am thrilled that the College of Business has been renamed in honor of him and Ann!!,What a gift! Go Tigers!,The launch video for this today had me in tears. The generosity of this family and the tribute to their grandson was very moving,We are incredibly grateful to the Powers family and the impact their gift will have on the next generation of global business leaders at Clemson!,I'm certainly in favor of progress::: but I'm confused as to why the architecture of the newer campus structures doesn't seem to bear any relationship to the rest of the campus. It just isn't attractive.,To bad you wrecked Bowman's fields beloved upstate south Carolina feel::: and the entire vibe of old campus. Love the addition to Clemson's education capacity. Hate the lack of consideration and respect for the campuses landscape.,Simply amazing!,As a second generation Clemson grad::: and after spending many years in business including the Walt Disney Company::: I love the commitment to world class business education. But I don’t not love the location nor the massive disproportionat e intrusion into the main core iconic place of our campus.,It is hideous. Could have been built somewhere else. Didn’t have to destroy that beautiful wooded hill across from Bowman Field.,Boy I miss Sirrine Hall! Lol!,"Hi Clemson University:::  You missed a space between ""the"" and ""dynamic."" Hopefully you can get this corrected.

Happy #TigerRagTuesday! Tag your Clemson travel buddy below.👇  📸: Riley Major,2020-10-13 22:21:34,On June 13 I marched with Trevor Lawrence and Darrien Rencher at Clemson in the Black Lives Matter movement. On that day in brief conversation Trevor told me in the hearing of many others He stood with Deshaun Watson and Drew Brees in the the then recent twitter Dustup with Trump over kneeling. As David Wilkins is former Clemson chair and tight with Lindsey Graham the Judiciary hearings have tremendous implications for the character of Clemson and its board of Trustees and football program. To get at the guts of that for all of us here is a comment I just left at the alma maters of Amy Coney Barrett::: St Mary's Dominican in New Orleans and Rhodes College in Memphis!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I went to check the dashboard for the school and it has not been updated in two days!!!! I wrote to the vice president of student affairs and no one responded. At this juncture::: I think Clemson is hiding the fact that the virus is out of control! My son tested negative last week and while he needs to be tested again::: he is presumed positive and prepared to move into the covid hotel/ apartments (assuming they have room for them). There are 510 student occupants already (out of a total population of 23k). How can it be that important to have kids go to the football games? Clemson repeatedly promoted to me that they were going to take all measures to keep these young people safe (so they can take advantage of the financial room and board) and at this point I have absolutely no confidence. Does anyone know anyone high up that can get a straight up answer?? I am very upset.,Looks like some fans that bought tickets are not showing up.Sone fans I know bought them but trying to sell them. STRANGE!!,Allow more fans!!!! What a sad sight to see the stadium so empty. I wish we could all move past this paranoia. Go Tigers! 🐯💜🧡,It’s all about the money,"Gospel MT 21:33-43  Jesus said to the chief priests and the elders of the people: ""Hear another parable. There was a landowner who planted a vineyard::: put a hedge around it::: dug a wine press in it::: and built a tower. Then he leased it to tenants and went on a journey. When vintage time drew near::: he sent his servants to the tenants to obtain his produce. But the tenants seized the servants and one they beat::: another they killed::: and a third they stoned. Again he sent other servants::: more numerous than the first ones::: but they treated them in the same way. Finally::: he sent his son to them::: thinking::: 'They will respect my son.' But when the tenants saw the son::: they said to one another::: 'This is the heir. Come::: let us kill him and acquire his inheritance.’ They seized him::: threw him out of the vineyard::: and killed him. What will the owner of the vineyard do to those tenants when he comes?"" They answered him::: ""He will put those wretched men to a wretched death and lease his vineyard to other tenants who will give him the produce at the proper times."" Jesus said to them::: ""Did you never read in the Scriptures: The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; by the Lord has this been done::: and it is wonderful in our eyes? Therefore::: I say to you::: the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people that will produce its fruit.""",Reading 1 IS 5:1-7  Let me now sing of my friend::: my friend's song concerning his vineyard. My friend had a vineyard on a fertile hillside; he spaded it::: cleared it of stones::: and planted the choicest vines; within it he built a watchtower::: and hewed out a wine press. Then he looked for the crop of grapes::: but what it yielded was wild grapes. Now::: inhabitants of Jerusalem and people of Judah::: judge between me and my vineyard: What more was there to do for my vineyard that I had not done? Why::: when I looked for the crop of grapes::: did it bring forth wild grapes? Now::: I will let you know what I mean to do with my vineyard: take away its hedge::: give it to grazing::: break through its wall::: let it be trampled! Yes::: I will make it a ruin: it shall not be pruned or hoed::: but overgrown with thorns and briers; I will command the clouds not to send rain upon it. The vineyard of the LORD of hosts is the house of Israel::: and the people of Judah are his cherished plant; he looked for judgment::: but see::: bloodshed! for justice::: but hark::: the outcry!,From what I heard::: students have to have a test for Covid before they can get a ticket. If they don’t go get tested they can’t get a ticket. To adults that sounds easy and worth it. To a 19-20 year old it is “just a hassle”.,So proud of the players for their short of each other and so proud of the administration for keeping the fans in the stands safe.,I totally agree... one of the reasons my daughter picked Clemson. Instead she sat in her room last night and didn’t even want to watch the game. 😢,Shameful that students aren't getting tickets. There are seniors who got zero tickets. The tickets should be going to students::: its their time and moment.,I see all of these comments and think::: “Wow::: Wake got to have 100 parents at the NCSU game.” Our kids are still in virtual school since March 13th. Sometimes you need to step back and look from someone else’s perspective. It makes you grateful for what you have.,Possibly because of where they put the students in the stadium?,aren’t?,They are selling tickets on stub hub,They were not playing like they have been.,I think that's good! No need for more people.,Why arnt the students showing up,👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

☑️ Mask up. ☑️ Social distance. ☑️ Admire #Clemson sunsets.  Happy #SolidOrangeFriday::: Tigers! 🧡  📸: Emma Rivers,2020-10-02 23:00:13,Tillman holds a special place for a lot of Tigers.,🧡Clemson 🧡,Beautiful sky.,For the past two weeks::: out of a student population of 23:::000::: the campus is averaging 55 positive tests per day. There are 480 positive students currently in isolated housing. (Spartanburg County population 275:::000 is averaging about the same per day so Clemson's rate seems very high). Clemson has not announced to the parents what is the magic number when too many are positive and they will shut down. The president's weekly message seems like it is all fine and dandy and the dashboard contradicts. Further the plan is to have the kids return after Thanksgiving for finals::: and there is no announced plan to have everyone retested before they return.,Beautiful,Beautiful,Go Tigers!

Why is he even in this country?,https:// campusreform.org / ?ID=15404#.Xy95N hIRxMY.facebook We have communists at usc too.,Clemson School of Computing Assistant Professor Bart Knijnenburg took to Facebook in July and wrote::: “Trump is xenophobic and racist. Trump’s administration is xenophobic and racist. The Republican Party is xenophobic and racist.” He continued on to say that::: “anyone who voted Republican in 2016 is xenophobic and racist:::” and concluded by stating::: “anyone who still calls themselves a Republican despite all this is xenophobic and racist.”,Bart Knijnenburg is a professor at your school??

A student who is a transfer does not submit scholastic aptitude test scores for consideration of acceptance. I was one over 20yrs ago. Went military first took a couple college courses during active duty and Clemson never inquired about test scores. Oh and to take courses at Baylor University as an active duty serviceman I was not asked to submit test scores either. This was 1986. Graduated from two universities Engineering and Business degrees without either so don’t sweat it. I went to prep boarding schools and we had classes that specifically taught us how to take the SAT and ACT to maximize our chances of success. Typical for most prep schools. Does every student have that same exposure?,There is something about working hard::: being competitive::: then getting the prize. You just erased years of hard work for students that did not give up until they had competitive scores. Wow::: Clemson::: wow.,How does this affect prospective applicants with a lower GPA?,This is stupid::: not all schools grading policies and level of education are equal::: standardized testing are a measure that’s the same across the board and is a quality measure of student knowledge. This is just more pandering to the left.,I hope you all keep this policy permanently. Standardized tests aren't good measures of much of anything.,she not be used anyway,Maybe look into this as a long term policy. Numerous studies have established the ways in which SAT/ACT are not reliable::: equitable::: etc.,Emily Merck,Rebecca Keller Kylie Cao,Christina Green McClure,I guess studying and test will be optional,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clemson remains committed to an on-campus return to learning and living this Fall::: with the health and safety of our students::: employees and surrounding communities as our top priority as we combat the global health threat of COVID-19.  For that reason::: Clemson University will begin the Fall semester::: as scheduled::: online only Aug. 19 and will delay in-person instruction until Sept. 21. No other changes to the academic calendar will be made at this time.  Learn more at the University’s COVID-19 update page: go.tig.rs/883cwh  CLEMSON.EDU COVID-19 Updates and Resources | Clemson University::: South Carolina,2020-07-22 19:25:31,Is Austin Hobson returning to Clemson University?,Harvard and Princeton are only bringing Freshman and Sophomores in the fall and juniors and Seniors in the spring. So smart! This move from being online to the campus will be difficult for many freshman as they are just starting their college experience. It was certainly a rough transition already for their senior year with many trying to finish AP exams and community projects. It would be great to consider just started Freshman in August at least.,Does anyone know the policy if a student takes a year::: or semester::: off and does some sort of GAP year? Do they need to reapply for admission?  We have an OSS as well::: so trying to put together a plan.,What are you doing about the Austin Hobsen situation? You know::: the student of yours who posed with some very racist language spray-painted garage?,His name is Austin Hobson and his mom is a public school teacher Agnes Hobson. He attends Clemson University. I wonder if they are aware they have a wanna be Klans member representing them? CLEMSON TIGERS Clemson University Parents,To Whom it may concern at the Clemson University:::  Thank you for your concern for our kids (your students). I know the decision to push back move in couldn’t be easy for you. I do not know the conversations leading up to this decision but I ask you these few questions.  1. Is there another way? 2. Could you find a way to get the students on campus (even with on-line classes). 3. Have you considered the risk of maintaining the fall schedule?  You have said time and again the schedule won’t change. Maybe that is where you should start. Eliminate all special weekends (parents/ family/alumni)::: cancel fall break::: don’t go back after Thanksgiving break. Limit the traveling on and off campus would limit the exposure. I’m most uncomfortable sending my freshman daughter with so many breaks and opportunities for outsiders to be on campus.  Do have each student get tested (rapid testing) upon arrival::: allow the healthy on campus::: make mask wearing manditory(fine first offense::: removal from campus second offense) you’ll have to have strict consequences also require testing while on campus. Have them sign a liability waiver if it’s a legal action you fear.  This is a virus::: I’m not a doctor but all the doctors I’ve spoken to have the same conclusion and that is it’s going nowhere.  I beg you please consider other options::: let those who are healthy and want to get on campus be there. Those who are high risk or not comfortable can remote learn. Keep classes online if you need but please let those who want on campus.  Thank you in advance for your consideration.,If students are not there we should all be billed in-state tuition. The cost for our students education from there couch at home is ridiculous,Open it all up! Teach the students how to be safe and protect themselves. Have PPE requirements for all university buildings. Everyone has already been living with it. It isn’t new. Only 1% of the US population has been infected! This is going to be with us for an extremely long time. We must learn to live with the dangers and practice ways to survive living in this environment.,Thank you for caring for the faculty::: staff::: students and community.,God Bless our great University and it’s leaders there and students as we move through this time .Plus also our government leaders that support us.,At least let us out of our housing contracts if classes go online for the entire semester! Don’t hold us to them if you can’t decide online vs in class. There’s zero need for a lot of students to pay for dorms/meal plans etc when they can take online classes at home.,"Seriously?! You would do well to listen to Purdue University's President: ""At least 80% of our population is made up of young people::: say::: 35 and under. All data to date tell us that the COVID-19 virus::: while it transmits rapidly in this age group::: poses close to zero lethal threat to them... We will consider new policies and practices that keep the remaining 20% (over age 35) separate::: or minimize contact between the groups. We will look to protect the more vulnerable members of our community by allowing (or requiring::: if necessary) them to work remotely."" We cannot continue to compromise our economic or academic pursuits based on questionable numbers and fear! I pray you will reconsider opening and letting the healthy and least vulnerable proceed with their on-campus experience while committing to protect the vulnerable and giving people the option to stay away if they prefer.",I’m sorry to say that some of the comments on this thread have nothing to do with intelligence. Thank you Clemson for doing the right thing. As a healthcare worker and proud graduate of the Clemson Nursing program::: you naysayers need to stick to your day jobs or else come spend a 12 hour shift on a Covid unit.,Thank you Clemson for considering the safety of students and teachers.,Why is everyone only concerned about $. So sad,Way to set the standard for our state! 🧡💜 UofSC needs to get onboard!,Sorry My opinion..the slow drivel of decisions is a greedy money grab to KEEP all on campus...Tuitio n Full price....Meal plans etc..etc.. Look at daily counts of Covid in small Pickens County and students..paren ts ... teachers aren't even back yet. Just imagine after families from ALL over come to move their students in..... what exactly will change between Aug 14 and September 19??????? Lets be real,So sick of this fear and handwringing over a disease with a 99.96% recovery::: so sick of leadership that won’t re-open and get on with it::: so sick of everything being politicized and students being held back from a quality education::: so sick of the thinking that somehow 6’ and a “mask” is the only way to survive now::: so sick of online classes at full tuition being the only path to a worthwhile degree::: so sick of everyone thinking they are going to get so sick....  I came to Clemson University because of the campus::: the face to face instruction::: the academic atmosphere and the personal relationships this institution has built.... it hardly seems worth my tuition to sit in front of a zoom call all day earning the same degree offered by an online community college without access to Clemson’s world renown labs and technology that has attracted us in the first place. Help me to understand what the hell I am paying for this semester!,Thank you so much its a wise decision because it's difficult to control corona in campuses and schools and public gathering. Thank you very very much,Thank you. Thank you Clemson!!!! If people in SC would wear masks instead of complaining maybe just maybe classes could have resumed. But you can’t fix stupid. So keep complaining and don’t wear masks. I pay out for out of state tuition and my child’s life is worth more to me than tuition. If you don’t know anyone who died from Covid than you don’t understand. There are 85 babies under the age of 1 in Texas positive with Covid. Please stop saying stupid things about how young people recover quicker. So many of you are so ill informed and your comments are a waste of time. If you don’t care about the welfare of your child....shame on you.,please just let students go home Thanksgiving and return after Jan 1 - no fall break - most other schools are doing this-,That’s a home football weekend depending on what the ACC does. Hotels already booked.,Going virtual is fine::: but to change move in dates three weeks prior::: assumes that everyone can just adjust their lives to move in September 13. If the kids are online::: at least let them move in and get their first year experience. Why test every student if you already decided it’s too dangerous?,Clemson University::: thank you for keeping the staff::: students::: and community safe! We will support a slight inconvenience if it gives our son a better chance to continue in-person classes when they resume. 💜🐯🧡,Not happy for our son who will be a freshman at Clemson. Out of state tuition costs for on-line classes. Anyone else dealing with this dilema?,Thank you Clemson for putting the health and safety of your students::: faculty and employees first! We know this was a difficult decision to make::: and we are eagerly looking forward for a happy and healthy return to campus for everyone!,Unfortunately::: I totally believed President Clements when he said the students would be on campus in August.,There are students who still have not been able to get their property out of their dorm.,The death of a superpower nation comes far sooner when our bright minds are not properly educated. This is exactly the risk we are taking with this delay.,I pray that y'all complaining do not get this virus. I work there and thank God Clemson is being responsible with our safety. Thank you Clemson!,I don’t live in S.C. So obviously I don’t pay their state taxes. I think the point the OOS parents feel that 50k plus is a lot of money for an online tuition. The natural reaction for anyone paying for anything is to get their full expectation met. I’m sure a lot of in state parents feel the same. No one WANTS to pay for online. We want it to be the way it’s meant to be. However::: the school is in a very difficult situation right now. So as parents we have to make our own difficult decisions as to what’s best for our student and what we can handle financially. Try to be nice out there folks There is enough ugly in our world right now.,I’m not upset about tuition::: in the end my student will get her credits for the classes. I am upset about having to pay off-campus housing for 12 months when we have no idea if/when face to face instruction will actually resume! The housing contract was signed in Nov 2019::: prior to the pandemic and we are stuck. 🤬,That’s unfortunate. Are we getting a tuition discount? Other parents have said they are getting tuition discounts from the colleges their kids are attending.,Mask up folks...get the numbers down!,This is so frustrating! We are paying for off campus Apartment as the University did not have enough space now this. I thought the University was requiring testing etc...this is not the education we are paying for. This is not going anywhere we at some point have to learn to live with it by taking precautions but this continual fear is ruining what should be the best time for these students. While cases are up people especially young people are recovering quickly...most with no symptoms.,"Y'all...the people in this thread writing some variation of ""we have to go back to living our lives"" are the reason universities are having to go online. Too many people went back to ""living their lives"" in mid-June. It failed miserably::: and now South Carolina has one of the worst outbreaks in the world. If a bunch of you had lived a bit less of your lives::: we might be able to return to something more approaching normal::: but you didn't::: and this is what we get. It's not Clemson's fault that South Carolina has become an epicenter.",What a relief! My child has asthma and I was afraid he would have to risk his life or loose his scholarships. Thank you for caring about the safety and well being of your students and your staff.,A somewhat frustrating and sad but good decision. As a student I appreciate it. I didn't want to come back to campus yet::: so thanks.,Thank you Clemson. 🧡🤍💜 for making what was probably a difficult decision (obvious backlash) the health of our children::: mothers::: fathers::: sisters::: brothers etc is most important.,Stupid. Get on with life. Get ready for student refunds.,Thank you Clemson for helping to protect us students during the pandemic.,These poor kids . We must start living our lives again .,At a minimum out of state students should be charged no more than in-state if you are going online. This needs to be addressed. Over $20k a semester for online? That’s not right.,Ridiculous. Hope there is a break in the tuition for this online stuff vs in-person. You should be sending them back as scheduled.,how will this affect the bridge students that live on clemsons campus,Who do I contact to donate my time to testing those returning for Covid? I am a travel ICU RN and have a lot of Covid testing experience...an d I am a Clemson mom. Please let me know how I can help! (also MUSC ICU RN for a lot of years),And graduation???? Hoping you are starting to think about splitting the ceremonies and having it in Death Valley outside. The class of 2020 deserves this even if it means students only.,What does this mean? Will this change move in dates?,Are students still moving in as scheduled?,This is bull. Discounts on tuition/ instruction and housing better be forthcoming.,Thank you for being responsible!,Shame on USC and Clemson. The University of South Carolina hands out pocket Constitution and Clemson does a one hour video to satisfy the SC state law to teach a yearlong course on the US Constitution. The Citadel requires a class that is three credit hours in length—a full semester class.,I’m not looking to offend anyone::: but my daughter is a Computer Engineering Major. Ages ago I majored in Political Science. YES::: Poly Sci courses can work via Zoom; I don’t believe that will be as convenient with Junior and Senior level Engineering classes!,If classes start online on August 19::: how do out of town students go about buying textbooks for their courses? Are textbooks online also?,This SUCKS!! I’m not paying these fees to have my kids sit in a BEDROOM and teach themselves!!! ARRRGGGGHHHH!!! ! What about rent payments NOT Clemson related??? We are screwed again!!! Give us tuition credit and housing payments!!! My kids don’t get stimulus payments cause they’re students.

This virus is not going away anytime soon::: and we MUST get on with life. This is such a disservice to the students. Not happy! 😡,"This is what on the student billing website: ""I understand and agree that Clemson University may in its sole discretion change the delivery of its courses at any time to partial or total online delivery without penalty due to circumstances beyond the University's control::: including but not limited to natural disasters (e.g.::: tornado::: earthquake::: flood::: hurricane::: etc.)::: war::: terrorist act::: strike::: public health outbreak (e.g.::: pandemic or wide-spread &/ or infectious disease outbreak)::: fire::: release of nuclear material or dangerous substance into the environment or other catastrophic event or major disruption of University operations or for any other reason. If the delivery of courses are changed to partial or total online delivery::: I understand and agree there will be no credit of any tuition (including academic fees and program fees). I understand and agree there will be no credit of other fees related to services that Clemson University continues to provide whether in person or in a virtual::: online::: electronic or other system. Credits::: if any::: for fees for services (other than tuition::: academic or program fees) that do not continue due to partial or total online course delivery or related closure of facilities would be subject to the approval of the Board of Trustees. I understand and agree that later charges for fees could be added to my account if (1.) credits are made and (2.) partial or total online course delivery reverts to in person delivery prior to the end of the semester and (3.) discontinued services supported by fees begin again prior to the end of the semester. I understand and agree that any credit would be first applied to the then-outstanding balance and therefore after application of a credit::: I may not receive a payment and am still obligated to pay the remaining balance on my account."" So not only I don't get a final semester at clemson::: I have to pay full tuition. And I can't even wait a semester because I have a single class you have to take for my major and only offered in the Fall.

Key decisions have been made for Fall semester and special October commencement dates have been set.

I well make sure that everyone know this so no more people apply to attend I wouldn't attend a school like this and I wouldn't want none of my children to attend a school like this either.

You’re just giving them a leg up and position of privilege to abuse others.,Austin Hobson...a student in your university is a Racist.,I would appreciate knowing what plan is in effect and what dorrm has been set aside to house those testing positive (without symptoms). I think it would be a terrible oversight to send infected young adults out into the community to spread it to their families versus setting aside housing for their quarantine period. It will allow them to be social amongst themselves. I know that other countries::: such as Israel::: put the positive folks into a hotel for example. It avoided the isolation emotional impact and stigma of testing positive and it worked to keep the numbers down. Isolating in a regular dorm only puts all others at risk because it can linger in the air for hours.,What’s this?  https:// www.facebook.com / 100008125274473/ posts/ 2654612461486237 /?d=n,Agnes Hobson is raising a racist::: what’s happening to her???,It’s okay to be a member of the KKK and attend here.,BAN AUSTIN HOBSON from your school and provide PROOF he is gone or you stand with his ideals of hating blacks and loving racism!!,I saw the racists who said nigher don't matter.smh shame on this university,Is Austin Hobson still enrolled?,Wow..

CLEMSON TIGERS Clemson University Parents.,His name is Austin Hobson and his mom is a public school teacher Agnes Hobson. He attends Clemson University. I wonder if they are aware they have a wanna be Klans member representing them? CLEMSON TIGERS Clemson University Parents.,Please let us know commencement exact dates/times. We live in VA and our daughter is a Spring 2020 graduate and our son’s wedding is Oct 10!!😩 Trying to determine if we can pull both events off🙏🏼,Laws basically are made to protect us from each other. You get that? Laws are made to protect me from you and you from me. But I don’t need those laws if I love you. What is missing in the human heart is this kind of love. There’s no love for God::: there’s no love for others that satisfies God. So in light of this reality::: we are to love. We are to love God so that we obey His word; and His word says::: “We are to love others as ourselves. We are to do no injustice::: take no vengeance::: do no harm to anyone ever.”  So as a Christian::: I’m looking at the world today and I’m watching all kinds of things going on with regard to injustices and suffering. There’s no question about it::: there’s lots of injustice in the world. It’s everywhere. Nobody has a corner on it and no group of people have a corner on it. So what are my options in the current situation? Let me be specific and give you some that have been suggested.  First of all::: one option would be to join Black Lives Matter::: join their cause::: because::: after all::: Black lives do matter; of course::: they do – created in the image of God. And those who have suffered deserve our support::: and they do; and they have suffered injustice::: and they have. So should we just join Black Lives Matter to affirm these things? “Can we join out of sympathy? Can we join out of compassion?” That’s not really the question. The question is::: “Can we join::: and in joining express love to God?” because whatever we do for our neighbor is subsumed under loving God with all our heart::: soul::: and mind. “Can I join Black Lives Matter? Can I be a part::: if not a member; can I be a part of their function?” They are disruptive. They are rebellious. They are radical. They are anti-authority. They are Marxists. They are atheistic.  What are their guiding principles? Let me read them to you. In their own document we read this: “Black Lives Matter is transgender-aff irming. We make space for transgender siblings. We do the work required to dismantle cisgender” – which mean biological sex – “and uplift transgender Black folk::: especially transgender Black women who continue to be disproportionat ely impacted by trans antagonistic violence.” They are transgender-aff irming. According to Deuteronomy 22:5::: transgender behavior is an abomination to God.  Also::: this is their declaration: “We are womanists rather than feminists.” Quote: “We build a space that affirms Black women and is free from sexism::: misogyny::: and environments where men are centered.” End quote. Transgender-aff irming and wanting to pull down the leadership of men. According to the Word of God::: man is the head of the woman::: as God is the head of Christ. The man has the responsibility of leadership. That’s an anti-God idea. Another paragraph – and there are many more: “We are queer-affirming . We gather to free ourselves from the tight grip of the belief that all are heterosexual.” They gather to put an end to the notion that everybody needs to be heterosexual.  In he same book of Leviticus::: where the Lord says::: “I am the Lord; be holy:::” chapter 18::: verse 22 say::: “You shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female; it is an abomination. In the next verse it says it’s the same as having intercourse with an animal. Chapter 20 of Leviticus::: verse 13::: exactly the same thing. Romans chapter 1.  Here’s a quote from Black Lives Matter: “We are intentionally amplifying that the particular experience of violence that Black queer transgender::: gender nonconforming women and intersex people face::: there can be no liberation for the Black people if we do not fight for these people.” This is an organization designed by Satan to use the suffering of some people as the means to destroy their lives::: to destroy morality::: conscience::: the family::: and even the church::: and replace it with behavior that is immoral::: perverse::: abominable::: soul-destroying ::: family-destroyi ng::: marriage-killin g::: and culturally disastrous. Bottom line: those documents are anti-God::: anti-Scripture::: anti-Christ. This is an organization that is the enemy of God. Do you really believe that going down that path is going to do anything to lift up a culture? It has nothing to do with the color of anybody’s skin. Go down that path and it’s the path of absolute total destruction. Wipe out the law of God in the heart::: give people immorality as a standard::: destroy the family::: take the message of the gospel out of the church::: and the only possible restraint left is the police to try to stop the flood.,His name is Austin Hobson and his mom is a public school teacher Agnes Hobson.

Is that what your community trumpets or does it simply turn a blind eye and deaf ear??

"This morning::: our Clemson Board of Trustees approved two important actions on the name of the Honors College and Tillman Hall.  President Clements stated::: ""Our work in this area is far from finished::: but we are committed to building on the progress we have made in the areas of diversity and inclusivity as we strive to serve our entire state and the nation.""  NEWSSTAND.CLEMSON.EDU Clemson Trustees approve Honors College name change; request authority to restore original name of Tillman Hall",2020-06-12 15:04:58,Austin Hobdon picture on fb. You should be ashamed of students like this.,Austin Hobson has posted a very racist picture on Facebook. I think he is a student at Clemson,Austin Hobson is a racist that goes there.,Well as long as we are renaming things because of the past offenses of our various leaders let’s get on with it. Washington and Jefferson were slaveowners. Let’s get rid of those monuments and names. Oh gosh 18 of our presidents owned slaves::: including general US Grant. The problem with this whole business is where does it stop? And the answer is it never ends because there are always new wrongs to be outraged about. There is not a country or ethnic group in the world::: I believe::: that has not in some point committed a wrong::: great wrong against humanity.,This is pandering to professional athletes . You can’t erase history. I hope the Tillman and Calhoun heirs sue to have current day value of university returned to them. Ridiculous! All you folks who applaud this better get your checkbooks out. Here go contributions.,Proud of Clemson’s Board and Administration for listening to and appreciating the positions of black and minority students and alumni. Go Tigers!,I’m sure digging up history and changing the names of buildings is really going to make a difference in the world... focus on injustice and police brutality issues not rewriting history hundreds of years ago and building names.,Wow amazing that someone actually has power enough to change history. Amazing. Wow and it only took a few days to change everything,Knee-jerk reaction. Changing names does not change history in order for people to grow and not repeat mistakes they need to have the history to learn. I think it’s a bad move,"That is completely idiotic....the school has history and just because someone doesn't like it you are going to change it??? How about all the people you are offending by changing it??! I'm outraged that Clemson is losing their history. If there is something on TV that I don't care to watch I change the station to watch something I do want to watch. If they don't like the name of a school or a building go somewhere else. I have been a die-hard Clemson fan all my life but I will be rethinking that. It just doesn't make sense to kiss one group of people's ass just to piss off another that has always been in your corner. Maybe ""Death Valley"" should be changed too....maybe to ""Weenieville"". I will not be attending anymore games and that is a fact!",Proud of you::: Clemson. And thank you for letting us be able to see the racism in the comments so we know who is really supportive here. 😉,Changing a few names does not erase history::: it reconciles it.  I don’t here anyone complaining about changing Carolina to North and South Carolina in 1710. Well::: they did and it is still a historical fact.,My father graduated after World War ll::: I am an alum::: my husband::: children::: sister::: and nieces and nephews. I an proud of this decision. Thank you Board of Trustees!,Such a shame. We cannot erase our history.  Stop trying to re-write our history. Learn from it instead.  Realize that all great men/women who made wonderful contributions to our college and our community::: were not perfect and didn't always do the right things in all facets of their lives. Do any of us?  These historical buildings/ markers/statues do not signify EXISTING cultural views::: they signify our past::: OUR HISTORY. The good::: bad and ugly of our history.  If we forget our history we are bound to repeat it.  To cite Orwell ‘he who controls the past::: controls the future’ is too often read as a manual for action rather than a warning against authoritarianis m.  Shame on you Clemson University! You have done a disservice to our college::: our towns and to history itself.,This is absurd. Changing the names on buildings doesn't change the past. We have obviously moved on and grown from the past::: but is ridiculous to try and erase it. And if you are uncomfortable going to Clemson bc of that::: by all means::: go somewhere else. But you may want to steer clear of the south.,If it was such a problem now how come the boys that started the petition accepted the full ride to play for Clemson,Not saying it’s the right thing or the wrong thing::: but I am saying that the university gave into peer pressure without debating all the issues,Booooooo!!!!! Are you going to change the name of the university as well?? History happened. That’s what makes it history. We learn from it. You have opened A huge door...,1981. That was when the honors college was named after him. That is all.,My grandfather WWII veteran attended Clemson when the building was called Old Main. I’m glad they have gone back to the traditional name. Hopefully the politicians in Columbia can get moving on this.,Hope Calhoun’s descendants revoke the land grant that the school occupies. Gonna tear down the mansion too?Rename the school?Youre destroying your own history! COWARDS!,Bowing to pressure is nothing to be proud of..,I'm a very proud alumna today. Calhoun's and Tillman's history can be taught from books instead of being glorified by having things named after them.,So will Calhoun Memorial Highway be changed to something else ? Should we just throw out the history books and the problem be solved ? If people would stop dwelling in the past that cannot be changed and work on making the future better for our kids this world will be a better place . Stop all this nonsense.,Thank you Clemson! I always cringed a little while my kids attended Clemson and I knew the names you were honoring. You’ve done the right thing.,"I could not care less about Tillman being changed; he was an important figure in the establishment of the University. His stance on race was common during his time and his outspokenness on the subject isn't positive...but his treatment of anybody who didn't align with his political motives wasn't all that nice::: either. HOWEVER::: I draw the line at the removal of Calhoun from anything. JCC served our state and country in many::: many honorable roles. The lion share of the US's founding fathers were part of the mindset and society of the time. If we're going to cave to this::: we should ""start over"" as a country and rename EVERTHING that has any tie to anyone who isn't of today's values; i.e.::: buildings::: towns::: counties::: states::: country and yes::: even our continent (Amerigo Vespucci did own slaves). Furthermore::: the land which was eventually GIVEN to the state is what the core of the university sits upon. We cannot change history nor can we change the mindset of times past. Clemson University has not excluded anyone in recent times; women and people of color were all excluded::: but not anymore. Clemson University embraces the educational development of ALL people regardless of any ""differences"" they may possess. Stop with all this knee-jerk reactions. Stop trying to make-up for past transgressions. ..no matter what gets ""changed:::"" the past will always be just that; the past!",Clemson has always been a remarkable place for enlightenment ! Thank you for this thoughtful and courageous step forward.,As a Clemson alum::: I'm fine with this. It removes two big distractions and makes minority students feel more welcome.  A wise decision.,Well done::: Clemson. Thank you for listening to the people.,I hope you will continue to consider taking these necessary steps in order to show Clemson as an institution that's welcoming to all::: and to take many of the comments on this page at their nonexistent face value.,Proud to see Clemson looking forward beyond 2020 rather than longing for 1860.,Just here to see the racists talk about history... we know theirs is the one that matters 😁,I went to Clemson. I earned my degree from taking classes in TILLMAN HALL. Great memories. It WILL ALWAYS be TILLMAN HALL. Change it all you want but it will it then be ( insert name) the building formerly known as Tillman Hall.,So the names change. All of you getting so bent out of shape::: remember that the building and Honors College are still there::: and Clemson continues to provide world class education to it's students::: of all races and creeds. That's what matters.,History can’t be changed::: but perspectives on it can as we listen::: learn::: reflect::: and grow toward the future.,As the parent of a son who will be a senior this Fall::: I am proud that the Board of Trustees have listened to the voices of their students and the community at large and have taken steps to make these changes.,I am so pleased. GO TIGERS! When I was a student at Clemson in the late 60’s::: early 70’s::: the country gentleman mascot::: the playing of Dixie::: and the display of the confederate flagsat games was stopped with weeping and wailing. We survived it and flourished.,What a shame. I guess we can expect anything to do with slave owners George Washington and Thomas Jefferson to be eliminated next. Its only a few things like the Washington Monument::: Jefferson Memorial::: Mt Rushmore::: one and two dollar bills::: the name of our nation's capitol city and a state on the West Coast. Are we going to change our history books to remove the mention of anything that may be offensive? Where is it going to end?,Well done::: Clemson University!,Never been prouder to be a Clemson alum. Work remains to be done::: but this is the all-important first step. GO TIGERS!,When are you going to change the name Clemson?afteral l Thomas Clemson was the son in law of John C.Calhoun:::owned over 250 slaves and fought for the Confederate Army! You can try to re-write history::: but you can't change it!,Proud to see you do the right thing even when unlearning our past is emotional and hard. Thanks for being a leader!,Aside from all of the horrific things Benjamin Tillman did::: he was a graduate of the University of South Carolina.  That alone should have been grounds for restoring Old Main’s name.,Thank you to our Board of Trustees. This matters.,Embarrassing that history cannot be learned from. My last name is Lee. Y’all gonna change my diplomas too??? Horrid n embarrassing!!! !,What a great and bold statement! Great decision for students::: faculty::: staff and alumni.,Proud alum everyday but especially today,Proud member of the Clemson family::: which values and respects all of it's members. ❤️,Proud to be a 🐅 again. Remember this history being made.,Thank you trustees!,"The problem with this is it won't end here.  Thomas Green Clemson served as a miner in the confederate army and it's documented he did this unwillingly as they held his land hostage. His son was also conscripted and spent nearly the entirety of the war in a Union prison. If you read the will of Thomas Green Clemson::: and I have::: it is purposely ambiguous and has no mention of race or sex. Dr. Jerry Reel discusses this at great length in his History 100 ""History of Clemson"" class.  Clemson was essentially created as an agricultural ""experiment station"" under the Morrill Land grant act to help rebuild the war torn south. TGC outlived his wife and all 4 of his children and granted his land to the State of South Carolina to create a Seminary of higher learning.  The problem is there has been a lot of focus on these buildings and names for years::: it won't end here.  https:// www.amazon.com/ High-Seminary-Ag ricultural-Caro lina-1889-1964/ dp/0984259899",This is not where this ends. The only logical next step is to rename the university. Thomas Green Clemson was a confederate soldier who wrote “My experience tells me that the Institution of slavery is at all times good for the Negro (no laborers in the world are so well off.) “,Proud of the Trustees decision. Our great University should evoke feelings of inclusion in all and celebrate our diversity.,So when will you vote to change the name of the university?,Another wise step in the right direction regarding equality for all humans. I have no doubt the university will continue to adapt and make the right decisions.  Great decision. -Class of 2008 💜🧡,Why stop with Calhoun and Tillman::: Thomas Green Clemson was a slave owner and fought for the Confederate Army. Rename the University if you're going to judge past figures on today's standards.,Why is it deemed necessary to change history??? Totally opposed to the proposed removing of the name Tillman Hall.,History is history...you can be progressive without removing it. Why try to change what has been for the sake of what will be? New buildings can have new names. What changes history by changing a building name? Clemson is an amazing college. History built it.,Looking at all the comments by people who have been uncomfortable with and offended by the names on buildings at Clemson::: why did you choose to attend or allow your children attend. Surely if you were accepted at Clemson::: other schools would have also!,"Excellent and bold decision! Leadership requires tough calls especially in the face of voices that like things ""just the way they are"". Great message and Go Tigers!","When I was a student at Clemson in the 80s I sat with a friend from high school. When I returned to my hall in Johnstone I was chastised for sitting in Harcomb at the ""black table."" This step is a small but important step in the right direction.",When you remove the names or monuments of the past people will lose the reminder of history. Good and bad history. People who want to change these things rewrite history so that the next generations have no ideal of the real past. Then history repeats. Seeing a monument or a named building should encourage people to learn more about them::: good and bad. Luke 6  41 “Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother’s eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? 42 How can you say to your brother::: ‘Brother::: let me take the speck out of your eye:::’ when you yourself fail to see the plank in your own eye? You hypocrite::: first take the plank out of your eye::: and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye.,So disappointed in Clemson!! Quit giving in to these people!! They want to dictate everything and I'm f'n sick of it!!!,You have got to be kidding me::: this does NOTHING to help anyone. I guess the Calhoun mansion will be torn down next. Toadying to bullies.,I think financial support for Clemson will suffer with this foolish move. What is next? Do we change the name to Crimson University? Something that matches the embarrassment I feel. It will always be known as Tillman Hall to me::: no matter how much they try to alter history.,Unpopular Opinion: I still remember a group in the middle east that went around blowing up statues they found offensive. What was their name.....Oh::: The Taliban.,I am so proud to be a Clemson tiger/ alum! Thank you board of trustees for listening to us! I am excited for Clemson’s future and for hopefully creating a legacy in the future! 🧡,This is not about white vs. black. This is not about Rep. vs. Dem. It IS about dark vs. light. Ultimately::: it IS about good vs. evil. Clemson::: sadly::: is caving to the dark side.,Some history belongs in a museum::: not on a building. Props to the Board of Trustees.,Thank you to the Board of Trustees for taking these actions!,Everyone is folding like a deck of cards. Give an inch and they will take it all. I miss my COPS show. Bad boys::: bad boys...,Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it. If we see reminders in our every day life we are less likely to repeat our history. This is not about heritage. This is learning from our past. Changing names is not learning from the past. Since Thomas Green Clemson served in the Confederate army::: should the name of the school also be changed? Thomas Green Clemson believed in education. History is a part of education. By changing names it’s like the university is trying to erase history. Yes::: some will say the information will not be forgotten::: information can be placed in a museum. When was the last time you went into a museum,Thanks::: Clemson. As the parent of an incoming Clemson Honors College student::: this is a welcomed and appreciated change.,Request denied! The Heritage Act was suppose to end it all. So guess what? NO! Stop bowing to crybabies and snowflakes and be proud of what the people did and acknowledge that it was a different era and that things have progressed. Bowing to everything means you stand for Nothing.,You realize that Thomas Green Clemson was married to Calhoun's daughter and he was a First Lieutenant in the Confederate Army. I know a great revisionist history book you should use in your American History class...... Political correctness run amok,I am absolutely certain that ANY graduate of this prestigious Honors College will AGREE with this decision.,So now the name Clemson must be removed from Clemson University. Further::: the town must be renamed from Clemson to something else. If the town doesn’t rename then the university will have to relocate somewhere else in protest. Where will this new cancel culture end?🤦‍♂️ ********* Thomas Green Clemson::: the University’s founder and namesake::: was as complex as the times in which he lived. In his 80 years::: he achieved fame as a diplomat::: an agriculturalist and a mining engineer. Clemson was a renaissance man whose hobbies included music::: art and the classics of the ancient world. Clemson was also a Confederate officer and a plantation and slave owner.,Tillman was the worst kind of bigot::: even for his time. I have been amazed for years that the building ever bore his name in the first place. Look him up folks.,This is disgusting just because it offends someone! You can’t change history!,wonderful to see action accompanying an awakening of sensitivity. yay clemson!,Pitchfork Tillman was evil.,As an Honors College graduate::: I’m proud of Clemson for taking action on this issue.,Go ahead and change the name of Clemson university as well. Thomas Green Clemson was a confederate officer::: plantation and slave owner. If you’re gonna start changing names and history to avoid hurt feelings go all out. Don’t just stop with the easy ones. You’ve shown your belly and rolled over. If Clemson is “All In” change your universities name,Clemson University needs to be changed too... I mean like Thomas Green Clemson was a slave owner too right... and a confederate soldier.,What a slap in the face::: trying to change history. And that is what was. SHAMEFUL. You may change the name::: but guess what. You can not change where it is situated! How easy to forget::: He served as the country’s seventh vice president::: from 1825-1932::: first under John Quincy Adams and then continuing under Andrew Jackson. He had also represented South Carolina in the U.S. House of Representatives . Too bad their is not something in the deed to pull the land from underneath you::: pandering to troublemakers. Clemson's new statue for 2020 https:// www.facebook.com / photo.php?fbid=3 225176550874709 &set=a.14823851 1901877&type=3& theater,Cancel Culture totally out of control.,That will not be happening. Calhoun and Tillman are different. They had things named in their “honor” many years after they were dead. Clemson Agricultural College was created by and named for Thomas Clemson.,They should give back all money to those that donated to have a building named after them.,Bravo::: Tigers. About time. Remembering the Confederacy is essential for understanding history and how not to repeat it. But honoring the Confederacy makes about as much sense as Germany honoring the Third Reich. There is a reason there doesn't exist a Himmler University::: Goebbels College of Communications::: Eichmann School of Engineering::: or Mengele College of Medicine.,How about the name Clemson itself.... Thomas Green Clemson (July 1::: 1807 – April 6::: 1888) was an American politician and statesman::: serving as an ambassador and the United States Superintendent of Agriculture. He served in the Confederate States Army. He founded Clemson University in South Carolina and he own slaves,Where does this silliness end? Here are a few examples: [I]n Boston::: demonstrators vandalized a monument to the 54th Massachusetts regiment::: the second all-black volunteer regiment of the Union Army:::” Justice writes. “… Add to the growing list of civil rights freedom fighters defaced by social justice protestors a Minnesota memorial to three black men who were lynched in 1920 following false rape accusations from a white woman.,It’s about time!! Proud to be a tiger today — Clemson should represent inclusivity instead of outdated historical figures who believed education was reserved for specific races and classes.,The board should also convene and vote on a proclamation that states::: while Clemson cannot change the name of Tillman Hall by state law that Clemson university denounces the person Benjamin Tillman::: his ideologies and actions and that Tillman Hall nor Clemson university no longer holds any relation to Benjamin Tillman therefore officially severing ties between the university and Benjamin Tillman. While the building will remain “Tillman Hall” until the state acts::: its name moving forward will only be linked to the legacy of Clemson’s campus and not the person of Benjamin Tillman. Also remove all items honoring the man.,Didn't John C Calhoun give the LAND upon which Clemson was built? Would Clemson even exist without him? I'm genuinely asking because while I understand changing the name of Tillman::: you can't erase Calhoun from your history. I'm genuinely worried about what will happen to the John C Calhoun house. Because this will never end. If people are offended by Calhoun's name::: they will be offended by the house. Can you move your entire campus?,Clemson was Calhoun’s son in law::: why stop with Tillman and Calhoun 🙄,Guess you better move the college - can’t have them walking on the ground where slaves walked.,"""An appeaser is one who feeds a crocodile::: hoping it will eat him last."" - Churchill. Very disappointing decision indeed.",Tillman Hall will always be Tillman to me. And I am definitely against any racism.,Its a bunch of hogwash! Poor lil powder puffs out there. Tillman was a major reason we even have a Clemson University!,Thank you Clemson for doing the right thing 🧡🧡! It’s a time for change Graduate Class of 2016,To be totally consistent and non-hypocritica l::: when the Board of Directors remove the Clemson name from the University’s name? He was after all Calhoun’s son-in-law and slave owner as well.,All well and good. When will we hear about an actual graduation for the class of 2020::: Honors College and all? Hello?,"When we heard the bells of Tilman Hall chime::: or saw it's majestic structure::: we just knew its name. I never knew about its namesake and neither did I or anybody else on campus in the early '80's care. But these days::: some people have just got to be looking for something of which to be offended. So::: ""Old Main"" it shall be again. But by doing so::: no real progress will be made in weeding bigoted officers out of police forces or in improving African American upward mobility out of blighted neighborhoods.",We support you! Great decision! Go Tigers!,"Disappointing that it took a spotlight of racial tensions & violence in the US to push this through. Or was it the football team?  It is overdue Clemson. Let's have a real conversation about who Ben Tillman & John C Calhoun were.  Better yet::: edit your post to ""The Clemson Board of Trustees approves removing racists John C Calhoun & Ben Tillman's names from university buildings & Honors College""  Calhoun defended slavery & Ben ""Pitchfork"" Tillman was a terrorist",I think you should change name to university of whatever,This isn’t the Clemson I went to. That Clemson wouldn’t have bowed down to the ignorance of mob rule and made such a knee jerk reaction.  I’m extremely disappointed in our University today.,Thomas Clemson was a slave owner as well. Can’t remove 2 slave owners name and not the 3rd. That’s biased!!!,Good decisions!

Clemson was a slave owner!,For all opposed stop your donations and all in agreement double down on your donations in a sign of thanks and appreciation.,Proud of our university for making difficult decisions. Erasing their names off of our buildings and organizations reflects our understanding that their beliefs and actions had a direct::: negative effect on our fellow Black Americans. They can be appreciated for what they gave us while also recognizing that their names are hurtful to others around us.  Always proud to be a Clemson Tiger 💜🧡,They rolled over and gave in,Proud of the BOT for approving this change.,You don’t remove history::: you use it as a reminder of where not to be. This is a lazy move for change. Find something else,Wonder how long it will take to have someone protest the NEW NAME ?,TO PERSONS THAT DONATE MONEY FOR SCHOLARSHIPS AND OTHER REASONS: STOP. I USED TO REALLY LIKE CLEMSON. BUT I SEE....,What's wrong with the old names? Not politically correct I guess. I'm sad to say I'm an alumni::: but Clemson will no longer get any money from me!!,Proud of my university! 💜🧡💜🧡💜🧡,Diversity! but don't you dare bring up diversity of an opinion. How fascist things have become.,Are they also considering changing the university's name as well?,It's time (well::: it's past time::: but never too late).,Going to be interesting to see how much old money leaves out,This is about Stupid. They are wanting everything to change. So let’s change it!! Martin Luther King should be next,This makes me so proud to be a Clemson Alumnae!,Why not drop all names and just number the buildings! Probably some numismatics would that offensive. Pathetic,Good...another reason to root against that awful orange color team!!,Thomas Green Clemson::: the University’s founder and namesake::: was as complex as the times in which he lived. In his 80 years::: he achieved fame as a diplomat::: an agriculturalist and a mining engineer. Clemson was a renaissance man whose hobbies included music::: art and the classics of the ancient world. Clemson was also a Confederate officer and a plantation and slave owner. WHY STOP THERE. CHANGE THE NAME OF THE SCHOOL. ITS RACISTS.,You can change the names of buildings but you can’t change racism in people. Parents raise their children as racist and it continues on and on. People have to change::: not buildings.,OK... let's now erase the names Deshaun Watson and DeAndre Hopkins from all official records of Clemson University.

Thank you::: Clemson!,Bending by definition::: creates weakness::: not strength.,I’ve seen Calhoun being called a founding father to justify his name remaining on things. The US was founded in 1776. Calhoun was born in 1782.,As a graduate::: I fully support this decision!,Cancel culture sucks.,Proud Alumnus! You did the right thing:::,And I don't know why you all are so happy. You think it stops here? It's just a matter of time before our mascot can no longer be a tiger. You know::: it's offensive.,So proud of Clemson University! ‘88 Go Tigers. 💜🧡,My parents attended clemson and lived in married housing. My dad had classes in Tillman hall. My parents told my sisters and Me that we were born with orange blood. What you fail to understand is you aren’t erasing Our states history::: you are erasing our history. Memories of people who weren’t racist who went to school there who have memories of Clemson. I’ve attended my last athletic event and spent my last dollar there.,What are you gonna do about Austin Hobson?? Is racism what you teach? His post will go viral,So now are they going to rename Clemson::: too? Thomas Green Clemson was a slaveowner too.,Proud of this swift and decisive work! CU Class of ‘85,Generation tidepod for the win!,As Clemson alumni this is extremely upsetting to me!,"Unless they rename the entire university::: this is pandering. T. G. Clemson and his son both enlisted and served in the Confederate army. Mr. Clemson owned slaves. I am unclear as to the distinction between him and Tillman::: except having seen statements that Clemson was ""a good slave owner"". Huh???  A prime example of circumstances taken out of the context of time. It will remain Tillman Hall to me.",This makes me very proud to be a tiger!,I thought they got rid of Tillman because it had issues????,I wonder how many people getting upset over this are actual Clemson alumni.,Another Orwell prediction coming true.,All I ask is for everyone to remember that no person is perfect. The o Lt person who has ever walked this earth without sin was the Lord Jesus Christ. I do not know what was in the hearts of Ben Tillman::: Thomas Calhoun or Mr. Clemson. I know that they had slaves - I don’t know what they actually thought about that or if they felt forced by the times. I don’t know how they treated the persons who they enslaved. That is a part of history that we miss because none of them are here to discuss the issues. What I do know is that at some phony in time it became important enough for Mr. Clemson to dedicate the property to become an institution of higher learning and that is a very significant milestone in history. I also know that originally Clemson A&M did not allow blacks to attend but it also did not allow women. But as times changed and the world advanced both blacks and women were admitted to the school. That transition was because of the changing times. None of that diminishes the fact that without that dedication of the lands to begin with::: there would be no Clemson University. We cannot erase what was. History is just that-history. We need to study history and learn from it. We need to accept the good and the bad of history and....hopefull y::: learn from it and move forward- taking the hood and leaving the bad behind.,Way to pander to the crybabies.,Way to go::: Clemson! About time! 🧡💜 🐾,Class act as always. Thank you Clemson for a being a leader.,You did the right thing! Thank you!!,When does all this end!!,Can we change name from Clemson to MLK University.,You people are so stupid. Are you now going to rename Clemson University to a different name or maybe tear it down. After all it was started by a slave owner.  Thomas Green Clemson (1807-1888) The University’s founder and namesake::: was a Philadelphia-bo rn::: European-educat ed engineer who married John C. Calhoun’s daughter::: Anna::: and settled at her family estate in South Carolina. Clemson was as complex as the times in which he lived: He was a diplomat::: mining engineer and agriculturalist whose hobbies included music::: art and the classics. He was also a Confederate officer and a plantation and slave owner. Clemson was a staunch advocate of agricultural education and was involved in the development of the Morrill Act::: which established the land-grant college system. His diverse education led to his visionary bequest and philanthropy that established Clemson University in his last will and testament.,Sarah::: so true. How many realize the school is on property that was a PLANTATION,I'm not a Clemson fan but my family settled in Greenville County in the sixteen hundreds and I hate to see our heritage::: good or bad::: throw away by liberal snowflake outsiders. The Board of directors need to go.,I just wanna know who gets to pay for the signage changes and taking down of statues::: etc. Could we just rent some sandblasters and give them to the people who have been so hurt by these racist names? It could be cathartic? Please do some kind of giving campaign or something because it seems like many many people are supportive of this. Please don't raise our tuition. We woke::: but I'm broke.,Time to boycott the tigers . Such an embarrassment .,I guess you will have to change the Clemson name as well.,Thank you and congratulations . Guy was just a terrible human being.,Thomas Green Clemson who the school was named after was also a slave owner,And I guess all of you would be the people that got on your knees and apologize for being white. It's just a stupid name. Look at what black people are doing to cities::: did Calhoun ever do that to a city?,Please show us some picture and what is happening now on campus.,Count on Clemson to do the right thing,Move Clemson University. It was built on John C Calhoun land.,MOVE CLEMSON UNIVERSITY. ITS SITTING ON CALHOUNS PROPERTY.,25 players positive for the virus... Dabo skirted the rules,At least we still have God!!,"Most of the people who are upset that this happened aren't even students::: alumni or faculty. They are just ""fans"" of Clemson. If this makes you not be a fan of Clemson any longer::: good riddance and thanks for identifying yourself for us.",Austin Hobson is a racist,Amelia,That is stupid....Calho un was a slave owner along with every other leader in this country’s history....he wasn’t just a slave owner he was this country’s Vice President and a South Carolina’s Senator!! That is what he is remembered for....and to rip that all away is shameful....if he goes then all other the other nations leaders who where slave owners like Washington::: Jefferson::: and Madison... etc. should be removed........ this nation is getting stupid!!,Surrendering to the mob is a slippery slope,The Board is obviously a bunch of reactionary cowards. They are supposed to have the intellegence to understand that these men lived in a different age and are symbolic in measuring the advancement since then. The Board placated a mob and stained the concept of history. Shall we proceed to the library and burn some books while we are at it? Washington::: Jefferson are they next??  Education? What the hell is that?,Sure is an awful lot of white privilege in these comments. God forbid you try to understand the harm 400+ years of slavery caused people and why a constant reminder::: such as the honors college name or the name of a building on campus::: would be a constant reminder of the atrocious crimes white people committed in the past. No one is saying forgot the past::: just that it belongs in a museum instead of shoving it in people's faces.,To everyone up in arms. 1. Neither were their original names for the buildings 2. Tillman did not own slaves. Instead he tried to pass lynching in Congress and denounced them in every way possible and boasted about wanting to kill them and did 3. Tillman wasn’t even a graduate of clemson 4. Calhoun hasn’t been the name for 40 years. Not a historical thing and we are making them neutral and not back to original name 5. Calhoun repeatedly said slavery is necessary and we cannot go on without it 6. Mr. Clemson was known as a good slave owner and was one of the few colleges at the time who did not ban African Americans or women. Don’t know anyone at Clemson who wants to change his name anyways 7. With the general assembly request Clemson said we will not be changing anymore historical names 8 and most important. How does it affect you if you never went to Clemson or graduated a decade plus ago?,Austin Hobson is posting disgusting racial pictures of himself on Facebook does this represent the University 🤔 #blacklivesmatte r 🖤✊🏽,I hereby withdraw all financial support for my ('74) Clemson University::: and my Father's ('38) The Clemson Agricultural College of South Caroline (Clemson A&M College).

It was solely done in my mind for the football program and it’s recent controversies. This was a reactionary move simply due to current events.  Clemson chose to be a follower instead of a leader. If they were leading and felt this necessary::: they would have addressed years ago when it wasn’t easy.  Thomas Green Clemson was evidently proud of his father in law and named his son John Calhoun Clemson. It’s a shame the BOT’s didn’t share that same respect for a former Vice President of this country.  These men weren’t honored due to the era of their birth and their slave ownership. They are honored due to their contribution to the founding of Clemson University.  Without the land of Calhoun and his son in law::: there would be no Clemson University.

President Clements shared a message with our Clemson Family today.  Read the full post here: https://bit.ly/2U0Drhr,2020-06-01 19:30:07,I don't think people should attack his mom for his wrong doings. He could've learned hatred anywhere? IJS,Austin Hobson is racist and needs to be expelled immediately!!!,Anyone know Austin Hobson-the Racist?,“Football Matters; Undisturbed Evil?  Slavery is not evil; far otherwise ::: I hold it to be good::: and will continue to prove so::: if not disturbed by the fell spirit of abolition” —John Calhoun::: whose Clemson honor’s program is named after.  Just the thought that African-America ns have fought for years to get John Calhoun Clemson University building renamed::: albeit::: unsuccessfully is a colossal indictment on our society. 2 times National Champion Football Coach Sweeney seats in a position of influence and prominence and has vastly benefited from African American athletes::: who have spoken against this over the years::: most notably Deshaun Watson::: but yet has been reluctant on tackling this issue head on.  Jesus once said::: “for where your treasure is::: there your heart will be also.”  If Football Matters so greatly::: shouldn’t you leading the charge on a passed down legacy of human injustice mattered even more. Is there no just cause?,wait::: but can you say that you’ll work to ensure that for black people? just say the words— you’ll work to ensure *black people* feel welcome and valued. it’s not that hard you cowards..,Are students going to be safe on campus ? Are there going to be protests::: riots?,So can we talk about renaming Tillman Hall or are we going to continue to ignore that?,it upsets me that there hasn't been any further update on Austin Hobson.,What an even sadder day. I revisited your page hoping to get an update stating Austin Hobson’s removal only to see the list is growing in terms of students who shouldn’t be allowed to attend your university. I’m praying students of color (especially athletes) and those who support and stand with persons of color withdraw from your time university! You only care when your pockets suffer.,His name is Austin Hobson and his mom is a public school teacher Agnes Hobson. He attends Clemson University. I wonder if they are aware they have a wanna be Klans member representing them? CLEMSON TIGERS Clemson University Parents,What y’all need to do is confront the situation with Austin Hobson and while you’re at it investigate some of his friends. I’m certain they travel in packs,DID YOU EXPEL AUSTIN HOBSON??? Your doing alot of talking but not saying much at all.  I just saw it on the news here in Pennsylvania,I’d like to know when you have expelled your student Austin Hobson for promoting racist messages on Instagram. I sent an email to the provost. I am following for a public statement on this matter.,there are a number of accepted students who would love to know whether they can ethically join the “Fam” this Fall. might want to come up with a plan to acknowledge black people exist.,Didn’t realize you allowed Bigots to get degrees at Clemson. That sort of hate speech is intolerable.,Austin Hobson seems to feel different. His post is filled with derogatory words towards people of color... and he is representing CLEMSON proudly. In the words of Trump... Very sad.,I have a multiracial child who will be attending this fall and I hope and pray this university will take action to make sure Austin Hobson and anyone who shares his views are not attending any longer.,I see by looking at the comments you have yet to address the racist post made by Austin hobson. Way to support his racist behavior,How could any minority student feel comfortable walking the same campus as Austin Hobson? As a current PhD student::: I wouldn’t💔💔,Great job Clemson. Austin Hobson must be a shining example of what you expect in students.,Yeah::: yeah. A bunch of pretty words with no action. If Austin is still a student::: then you guys do not mean any of this.,We need to know::: “Have Austin Hobson and the FILTH he represents been removed from Clemson University?”,Clemson y’all been known to have other racists at your school let’s be honest y’all need to address this issue for real instead of posting on FB,i already sent the emails to everybody whose in charge at tht school. they said it will be forwarded and handled bc they dont tolerate it.,You have students at your school including this Austin Hobson class of 23 who thought it was appropriate to post a picture of him advertising the KKK. You have an entire community of blacks students at your school this picture does not help them feel safe attending your school when someone advertises a hate group that threatens black lives,Who is he and what did he do?,Unfortunately the Austin Hobson comments and the Student Government comments had me confused so I did my research. First::: as far as the student who clearly has not made good use of his education::: I guess title nine didn’t matter to him. I’m sad to think in this day and age that this young man is being raised with this kind of ingrained value. Second::: I read the student government letter::: because I am aware that the President of the student government is a young black pre law male student and the Vice President is a young white nursing female student::: I read the letter as I believe it was intended. Maybe the wording seemed to offend some but I believe it was heart felt and came from a place speaking to fellow students in a rhetoric that needs to be present. We are all so quick to judge we are not seeing the true intention sometimes.,this is a really weak statement,Austin Hobson doesn’t seem to be on board with this message::: according to his social media posts::: at least. Is he the kind of student you want representing your university? A blatant::: hate-filled racist?,AUSTIN HOBSON needs his scholarship thrown out the window! I have family that is thinking about coming to Clemson when they graduate. His RACIAL slurs against African Americans were very UNACCEPTABLE!!! ! Clemson University,Do something about Austin Hobson!,Is Austin Hobson the type of student that helps make everyone feel “welcome and valued”?,Hopefully you hold your students accountable,You need to part ties with Austin Hobson,Deal with Austin Hobson. His behavior is disgusting.,Do some about Austin Hobson he is a racist😠😠😠😠😠😠,AUSTIN HOBSON IS A RACIST WHO ATTENDS YOUR SCHOOL,We demand the immediate action of explosion of one of your students::: Austin Hobson!!!!,Funny y’all made sure to turn the photo options off show people wouldn’t drop those screen shots of y’all former student Austin. That’s funny,I hope you all address the post in regards to Austin Hobson,This isn't Clemson::: and he should not be allowed to call himself a tiger. Take a stand in doing what is right. Its your time to decide do not let us down,Nobody won’t feel welcomed til Austin Hobson is kicked out . Y’all need to do a better job of picking your students! This is unacceptable,Austin Hobson is proudly being a racist on social media while also proudly being a Clemson Tiger....i wouldn’t think those two go together. Or do they? Guess I’ll let you good people of Clemson be the judge of that!,Austin Hobson should not be able to attend this school,Austin Hobson needs to be kicked out,You guys need to start with Austin since he’s a part of the KKK and attends you guys school ‼️‼️,"Then please do a better job of picking students to attend your college. You have a student by the name of Austin Hobson who made a post saying ""ni$$er don't matter KKK""",As the child of an academic::: I know that there are few places as diverse as a University campus. Professors::: undergraduate and graduate students::: worldwide research partnerships... there is a wealth of diversity on campuses.  The opportunity to explore freedom of thought::: be exposed to a global culture and learn from diverse instructors is inherent to the university mission.  Grades::: diplomas and football games are simply by products of the true University “product”.  Kudos to Clemson University for focusing on ways to bring us forward!  Go Tigers!,The first time I read this::: I was frustrated it didn't include any specific actions taken against racism and prejudice. The second time::: I was able to hear the imperfect attempt to join voices calling for change. Maybe::: Clements wasn't able to articulate specific actions yet. Maybe that's why they included the email address. Even imperfect::: I am glad they are trying. Dabo released a statement too and it wasn't perfect::: but I've realized we (white people) aren't always going to be perfect when we try to be allies. Sometimes::: we're going to mess up how we help. That doesn't mean we shouldn't try.,The student government letter is VERY inappropriate and wrong !,Maybe we should go on rivals.com and send the screenshots to all their football and basketball recruiting to let them know what they’re signing up for if the University won’t respond.,You have another one that needs to be expelled::: Connor Blackmon,Austin Hobson,then go ahead and get rid of Austin,Austin Hobson must be removed from your institution immediately,so are we getting a better statement or...,Austin Hobson is races,So have yall taken care #AUSTINHOBSON YET???,Hey Clemson::: let’s talk about Austin Hobson.,Better get that racist out of your school::: otherwise your words are simply that. How you could allow vileness::: once it has been shown::: to infect your institution::: is beyond me.,Hopefully you start with Austin as he claims to be a student at your university. I can imagine how he behaves on campus and with minority students he interacts with if he can so boldly smile and pose along side a disgusting and discriminatory act of vandalism.,y’all could start by talking to Austin Hobson ! Message me for the pics of him posing with n****** don’t matter and holding up a thumbs up to the KKK drawing 😊,As it has always been,"Please handle the situation with Austin Hobson. He spray painted the phrase::: "" ni$$er don't matter KKK"" and smiled while doing it. I hope you all do not accept that type of behavior.",Austin Hobson needs to be expelled. I have the screenshots.,Y’all have a racist going to your school::: Austin Hobson,Clemson calls their players the N word no thanks,At this time::: he knew he had fucked up,Austin Hobson,Austin Hobson,CU = 🦗🦗🦗🦗🦗 The longest they've gone without posting anything in quite a while.,Better kick that racist boy out if you wanna keep a good reputation,Expel Austin Hobson for his disgusting and disturbing actions in a time when the world needs to be coming together he’s only further helping spread us apart. The other students don’t want to go to school with racists and I bet you guys don’t want to be known as a school who lets racists do whatever they want. We will never forget the steps you take after this.,Are you specifically referring the student that is spray painting kkk iconography and racial slurs on property?,If Austin Hobson is not expelled::: we will expose this university for not taking racism serious. I’m sure you know how powerful social media is. I alone have 50k followers on FB and my sister with 2 million on Instagram. We want results!,"Your university should do a better job of implementing this example. A racist post::: supposedly from one of your students::: has been blatantly displayed in support of the the ""KKK."" I hope you intend to look into this matter.","Did yall seriously make this statement and then ""totally exonerate"" Nicholas Bunker after he posted ""hang them all"" on his instagram?? Clemson has a shameful history of apologizing for racism among its students (I was a freshman when those bananas were hung on the banner commemorating the slaves who died to build the university; The school issued a half-assed denial of racist intent and buried it) and suppressing conversation of the work that still needs to be done on campus (I was a sophomore or junior during the Sikes sit ins::: too- which Clemson likes to pretend didn't happen). I loved my time at Clemson::: and I want to continue to be proud of my alma mater::: but if the university is going to pretend they care about the oppression of black people while quietly excusing::: exonerating::: and protecting openly racist students::: I will not be donating money to any future fundraisers::: I will not be buying tickets to games::: and I will not be purchasing any more Clemson apparel or products. You would think a university built by slaves and started by slave owners on a former plantation would care more about actively making up for its origin story.",His name is Austin Hobson and his mom is a public school teacher Agnes Hobson. He attends Clemson University. I wonder if they are aware they have a wanna be Klans member representing them? CLEMSON TIGERS Clemson University Parents,If Austin Hobson is a reflection of Clemson university and you agree with his morals and beliefs then you are not a safe place for any child or adult. You are not a institute for higher learning if you allow this racist child to attend your school.,Austin Hobson made a racist post against African Americans on Facebook. Is this the type culture that Clemson accepts? If not::: we need you to do something about it!,Austin Hobson proves otherwise!! As a student of your University it proves exactly what is the problem. How “welcome” would your new admissions from the graduated class of 2020 feel about an openly racist student::: with public vulgar use racial slurs and defamation of property? As a parent of a High School student::: I wouldn’t consider your school a safe option for my or anyone’s child to attend nor see them being of any value. College is one of the most diverse platforms and Austin Hobson (your student) doesn’t prove this statement! President Clements the parents of prospective future classmen request that you complete an investigation to the racial act committed your student. Clemson University,Austin Hobson will be the reason your school will lose students::: money and ultimately be protested against. Hopefully you guys prepare for the *Niggers* that matter to speak up and pay your school and hopefully Austin a visit,His name is Austin Hobson (see image via link) and his mom is a public school teacher Agnes Hobson. He attends Clemson University. I wonder if they are aware they have a wanna be Klans member representing them?

When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple there whom he loved::: he said to his mother::: “Woman::: behold::: your son.” Then he said to the disciple::: “Behold::: your mother.” And from that hour the disciple took her into his home. After this::: aware that everything was now finished::: in order that the Scripture might be fulfilled::: Jesus said::: “I thirst.” There was a vessel filled with common wine. So they put a sponge soaked in wine on a sprig of hyssop and put it up to his mouth. When Jesus had taken the wine::: he said::: “It is finished.” And bowing his head::: he handed over the spirit.  Now since it was preparation day::: in order that the bodies might not remain on the cross on the sabbath::: for the sabbath day of that week was a solemn one::: the Jews asked Pilate that their legs be broken and they be taken down. So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first and then of the other one who was crucified with Jesus.

🐅 In this time of uncertainty::: we want to make sure our new Tigers are set up for academic success and a smooth transition to college life here at Clemson.

I've often wondered why Clemson doesn't have a virtual tour online like so many other schools do though. I've always thought that Clemson does so well with social media::: publications::: etc::: but I'm just shocked that no one can tour it virtually - especially in the situation we are in. The ones I have been impressed with are through YouVisit.,Holly Boggs Go Tigers!,Lane Hardin,Beth Reece Holton,Maddi Gorrell::: Drayton Wiggins::: Camryn Wagnon,"I was a Freshman Orientation Counselor ""back in the day""..we had such a good time with the new students and their families during the open tours and socials..take advantage of everything that is offered..even if it has to be virtual! #CU92 #TIGERBAND #ALTOSALWAYS #GOTIGERS",Penny Shomber Graham,Caitlyn Owen Lynn B Owen Jr.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And in the weeks and months that follow::: their deeds will power our journey forward::: toward brighter days when we can all be together again. Read their stories here ⤵️  NEWSSTAND.CLEMSON.EDU How the Clemson Family went above and beyond to respond to COVID-19,2020-05-11 22:32:10,My favorite part of your response was when we were still going to class and every day we would get an email saying how everything was fine and nobody had coronavirus. My second favorite part was when you sent us home for spring break without knowledge of whether the rest of the semester would be online. If I had to describe Clemson’s response to virus with one word it would be Opaque.,It would be nice it Clemson students could get their clothes and belongings. Two months with only week and half of clothing...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

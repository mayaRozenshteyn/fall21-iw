in the form of anal suppositories would be assimilated more quickly into the bloodstream without disrupting the GI tract.

I'd be surprised if Trudeau and Freeland agreed to it.,For antivaxers who are already skepticl they will say that it's going to be easier to poison,"I dedicate this text below to all free thinkers of this world:
A very important addendum i'd like to make. It'd be dishonest of me if i demonized the left and sanctified the GOP. No::: the GOP is also part of the problem of the decadence of America which i believe has started with the events leading to the Great Depression of 1929. There's an even more pernicious and destructive force acting in the shadows of power controlling both the left and the right of the political spectrum and it goes by the name of Freemasonry. Almost all former US presidents were Freemasons. The highly corrupt Bush family are Skull and Bones Freemasons. Puppet Biden is a Catholic Freemason. And so are Fauci::: Nancy Pelosi and many others from the high ranks in both the Democrat Party and the GOP. This semi-secret society controls both capitalism and communism over the last two and a half centuries. Nobody reach the top in politics without passing through their ""blessings"". They're a pagan anti-Christian Luciferian society with close connections with globalist anti-democratic
institutions like the UN and think tanks like the World Economic Forum::: the Bilderberg Group::: the Club of Rome::: the Trilateral Commission::: the Council on Foreign Relations and powerful NGOs/
foundations like the Rockefeller::: the Rotschild::: the Ford::: George Soros's Open Society::: Bill Gates etc. Soros::: btw::: sponsors the self-declared ""trained Marxists"" from BLM::: among other woke movements across the world (including assassination of babies in their mom's womb). So::: Freemasons have been working with communists/
socialists/
neo-Marxists::: globalists::: multinational corporations and even many fake conservatives like UK's Boris Johnson towards a so-called global governance. If you study the German philosopher Karl Marx you'll learn about his dialectics theory adapted from another German philosopher by the name of Hegel. In Marx's dialectics::: in the course of History::: there are always two opposing forces kind of wrestling each other for dominance. One of these forces he calls thesis::: its opposing one is called antithesis. So::: after they rub up against each other they create the synthesis. So::: in Marx's dialectics::: capitalism would be the thesis::: communism the antithesis and socialism the synthesis::: i.e::: the result of capitalism and communism clashing with one another. So::: the tiny elites that control the world believe that a global governance based on socialism will be the synthesis between capitalism and communism::: just as preached in K Marx's dialectics. So all these forces that i afore cited are working in the shadows::: diligently::: to push for this new socialist global order. The UN's 2030 Agenda is their benchmark. They plan to end with private property (UN's motto is ""You will own nothing but you'll be happy""::: clearly a socialist/
communist idea)::: national borders::: nationalism/
patriotism through multiculturalis
m::: end with Christianity and create a global religion::: end with national currencies and implement a global digital state-controlle
d currency::: end with local cultures and traditional values and replace with global values::: and::: ultimately::: end with nations's sovereignty and the little of democracy that we have and replace it with the technocratic socialist global governance. To top it off::: they plan to create a universal basic income for almost everyone. People will depend on the state to survive so they'll have to conform and obey otherwise your allowance is cut by the state. You may also lose points on the social credit system over the ""crime"" of ""hate speech""::: for ex::: and not be able to get your kids enrolled in good schools::: travel around::: get a job::: access certain types of goods and services etc. (If you think this is conspiracy theory check out the Chinese social credit system alive and well.) Or::: depending on your transgression::: you may be sent to ""re-education camps"" just like the Chinese regime do to Muslims from the Uighurs ethnic group::: Christians and anyone who oppposes the regime. (This is starting to happen in Australia with non-covid vaxxers and Canada has started to build facilities that they don't openly admit will be for the unvaccinated.) But you may be asking yourself::: ""How would they manage to put almost everyone on the governments payroll to create this kind of state dependency?"" Maybe by throwing the whole world into a state of poverty?::: ""But how?""::: you may retort. Maybe by creating artificial crises::: plandemics::: pushing green inefficient energies down our throats::: Great Reset and so on? Sounds too far-fetched for you? Not to me::: dude. At all. So::: lastly::: but not least::: Freemasonry is a pagan Luciferian anti-Christian society and perhaps the main force::: along with the Vatican::: behind a new socialist global governance. But commies/
socialists/
neo-Marxists::: globalists and the corrupted on the right work along with Freemasons::: both consciously and unconsciously::: directly and indirectly::: for a totalitarian global tyranny. And the woke people are the useful idiots and cannon fodder on the front lines. The ones killing and dying for their own slavery. If you weigh in on all of this::: you'll be able to add things up.",Yes::: ask any dealer.,Srabon Ractim,For a((ntivaxers who are already skepticl they will say that it's going to be easier to poison,Please be aware that the newly appointed fellow Ajmal Ahmady to Harvard University::: has stolen millions of dollars from the Afghan people and has also perverted the course of justice in the Yama Siawash assassination case. He needs to be sacked and held accountable for his actions.,kaching..,"https://

Nor did Harvard make any attempt to reach out to Vietnam veterans or otherwise recruit them.

And it took until 9/11 for Harvard to even reconsider bringing ROTC back on campus.

"Education scholars have debunked the myth that young people today are lazier and more immature than previous generations.

NEWS.HARVARD.EDU
Why kids are delaying adulthood",11/10/21 18:38,I think I’ve come a long way in understanding that education and practicality for their future. Our kids are every ready. We all stepped up when pushed & so will they. The only thing they lack is the RESPECT they way we were expected to give it::: it’s now earned & that the way it should be.,Behavioral science should take take note that getting old is stressful. Kids prolong this mentality including their dads. Mom control everything::: and need less law enforcement in the haus.,It has to do with the environment and culture and other things . For example it was found out that jewish youths are more productive because they learn trades at tender age. Young people are taken advantage of by some older people who want to reap where they sow not .,Of course they are lazier and more immature::: they have little to no consequences for their action and are spoiled. See what being your kids friend instead of their parent does.,In my opinion::: the percentage that are indeed motivated are highly motivated - perhaps even more than any other generation::: but the unmotivated seem to be even less motivated than their unmotivated predecessors.,indeed and it's because of technology::: lack of education among parents because now children have more freedom than the past::: the governments are also one of the reasons,I'd like to tell you the truth about Harvard one day. For a university that stands for truth::: it sure is very secretive. Personally::: I would prefer seeing a student population more representative of the US as a whole::: but I can see why its owners would want to admit as many non-whites as possible. He he he,Delaying adulthood::: to me::: sounds more like an excuse to avoid financial responsibility.,"As a millennial:
My past: Wars (20 years at least)::: Division::: Hatred::: Religious Fanaticism..
My present: Global Health Crisis::: Recession..
My future: Climate crisis::: Another cold war?

None of these are in any way any motivating factors and certainly not my choices. Our elders are the reason for this dilemma and they have completely forgotten that everything has an end including them.",Many venues of education have instuctors that act as educated fools.

The common Afghans consider the appointment of Ajmal Ahmady::: the former central bank governor::: former minister of trade and industry::: former senior adviser to the president of Afghanistan Ashraf Ghani ::: as a RESEARCH FELLOW at Harvard University; a disgrace and disrespect towards the Afghan nation. Mr. Ahmady is directly responsible for the current economic crisis in Afghanistan. He could prevent the collapse of Afghanistan banking system and the economy as a whole. While in the central bank::: he intentionally auctioned around USD 2 billion within one year and while the Taliban were advancing and capturing the provinces::: he deliberately transferred cash to the provincial branches of the central bank. There are a thousand examples of misconduct and harm that Ahmady and his boss Ashraf Ghani did in Afghanistan during the past seven years. Yet::: upon his return to the US::: he is appointed as a Research Fellow at World’s most prestigious University without considering his performance and his shameful achievements in Afghanistan.

The value of our stuff::: or the number of hours of that job position::: with the items we'll trade must be fairly consistent. like exchanging money But we don't need money Use the earnings amount of that hour or the items we have in exchange for merchandise. using only one card And can give our products or working hours at all through the card. but don't need money in order to thwart the influence of a group of ill-wishers on Earth who used to be slaves to the Raptilian aliens. to no longer be able to overwhelm humans with money. It would be great if the people of the world didn't have to spend money. A group that does not wish well to the world who produces money can no longer earn huge incomes. Americans and the world must step into a bright new era. Like aliens who have already raised their minds. which hopes well for the world An alien civilization that elevates the mind does not cost money.,Happy Halloween everybody 😆,Happy Halloween 🎃....,Today is all about selling more candy and giving the poor kids more cavities.,Happiness is only real when shared.,they probably came up from one of the creepier tunnels under the campus !,Happy Halloween 🎃,Happy Tom and Jerry.happy spider Man 😂😂😂,Lili Lili,Happy halloween 😈,Happy Halloween 🎃,Halloween in Bangladesh 🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲.Nothing to say.🥲🥲.,Md.

"Harvard University added 5 new photos.
October 29 at 9:04 AM ·
More options",10/29/21 14:04,I am proud of Hervard University::: Being the number one ranking university in world.,"A repost. I post this and similar stuff all over facebook. It's meant to be of general importance. I criticize America::: but also love and depend on my (on parchment) protections for basic human and civil rights::: and am proud of many American achievements::: while considering myself a citizen of the world.
Abductive reasoning says that the numerous (thousands to millions to billions to trillions) arguments against the existence of any ""god"" or ""gods"" add up to the conclusion of nonexistence. Legal rights and freedoms only apply to real things! This means that no one has religious rights or religious freedoms::: by legal doctrine. Ironically::: the doctrine relates to the ""fruit of the poisonous tree"" one. We have education and laws dealing with sanity because sane::: rational::: constructive::: critical thinking is vital. No room for ""faithful""/
delusional mistaken thinking when real problems are growing out of control. Myriad studies link religiosity to various forms of social malaise. Try to get some 1st Amendment quoting judge to argue that rights/
freedoms can be based::: without regard to real things::: on nonexistent parties::: such as a ""god"" or ""gods"".
Prayer is mathematically impossible. Communication of any sort::: from all of history::: is known to be only possible at finite/
limited distances. All of calculus-related mathematics (and how the modern world has been engineered)::: requires that finite numbers (such as for distances) and linear infinity (directly implied by any Abrahamic ""omnipresent god"" that ""exists"" without a limiting wall/cage of some sort) cannot be equated::: only related by transcendental numbers (or linear infinity can be used to find finite limits).
""Man created in God's image"": by the same thinking::: man has a shape::: an image::: and is finite. The claimed ""god"" or ""gods"" from the major (Abrahamic) religions all require that it be omnipresent::: without a limiting wall or cage::: thus infinite in size/scope. This even more obviously shows an attempt to equate::: not relate::: finite things to claimed infinite things. Mathematically impossible.
""Ultra""::: from WWII::: used broken codes::: the element of surprise::: and statistics (calculus based) to help win::: with Allied troops thence dying both with necessity and needlessly. Truth could have ruined the Germans' faith in the Christian Nazis::: ending the war much quicker. Insurance companies' bread and butter are calculus-based actuarial tables. Greedy insurance companies and legacy industries have blood on their hands! For example: people should heat their homes and cook with magnetic induction instead of another 80-some years of dangerous natural gas. Danger justifies premiums. And high premiums mean high profit margins.
The Russians spent millions of lives fighting the Germans and the Axis powers. Now the Eastern Orthodox Christian Russians sit back and watch Shia Muslim vs. Sunni Muslim wars::: terrorism::: and many other forms of religious harm. Also: In the waning days of WWII::: why couldn't we have fired off warning shots instead of bombing Hiroshima and Nagasaki::: beforehand? Were we that worried about Japan having nuclear weapons already?
Creationism is barred by the solution to the Basel problem and the Riemann Zeta Function provable Law of Conservation of Mass - all closely related to Big Bounce theory and to our basic instinct of ""object permanence"". Richard Dawkins and ""The God Delusion"" book. Bill Maher and the ""Religulous"" documentary. There are books dedicated to exposing the absolutist claims of the Abrahamic religions: claimed omnipotence::: omniscience::: omnibenevolence
::: and omnipresence. The internet is rife with valid arguments against any ""god"" or ""gods"" including many one-line or one-paragraph plaintive arguments. The Founding Fathers::: especially Thomas Jefferson::: rightly::: roundly ridiculed the many inanities of religions::: forging the U.S.A. to get away from the religious wars and their crippling expenses::: in Europe. America fearfully reacted to the Nuclear Age with a Red Scare and Christian revivalist crap that has eroded our infrastructure:::
jailed many innocent people::: spread fear and hate to every corner of society::: turned the media into wanton liars::: drugged the inner cities::: contributed to planned obsolescence and unhappiness::: created dangerous economic bubbles::: turned our budgets into a Ponzi scheme for the military-indust
rial complex::: wasted many resources::: directly and indirectly fostered diseases::: wars::: and starvation throughout the developing world::: and persecuted our best and brightest in sadistic and spooky ways. America has illegally silenced about a quarter of itself - the righteously outspoken ones. America has messed around with other countries far more than it's policed anything. America and the world are on a path to horrible ruin for as long as humanity is denied a fundamental understanding of reality. Enslaving lies will be ended::: or they'll end humanity as we know it.
There must be a carefully thought out::: peaceful plan to transition to the truth::: considerable costs of closely embracing reality be damned.
Religion came up with tons of b.s. to deny evolution/
natural selection/
survival of the fittest. If people don't speak up about how ""prayer"" (which is claimed to be a form of communication) is mathematically impossible and how any sense of ""creationism"" is barred by the provable Law of Conservation of Mass - and related ideas like how the universe - how our reality - is unlimited in size/scope as there is no such thing as a perfect closed system::: then religion will just keep on shouting down here and illegally silencing there. Religion will win if intelligent people say nothing or refuse to make the strongest arguments against the wrongs they see going on. Then humanity will be sentenced to a downward spiral of tyranny::: towards horrible::: needless ruin based on nothing actually REAL.
Again::: ""prayer"" is known to be mathematically impossible. (In principle::: this has been known since Newton/Leibniz and arguably since Euclid). The great lie of ""prayer"" - that communication can be achieved at the infinite distances of an uncaged::: omnipresent ""god"" or ""gods"" - will be exposed to the entire world. It's extremely likely that the corrupt powers - the Pope or the various kings and queens (and the like)::: have anticipated a pirate signal broadcast to unveil the truth. Instead::: mathematical enlightenment will likely come from a grass roots campaign or a disgruntled lesser power::: such as Brazil. (I had some hopes for China::: but it appears that they are far too corrupt).
Even an enlightened world will still have to balance how strong a stable::: central government can be::: just as early America (the U.S.A.) did::: and still does. The same codes::: much like the serial numbers on currency::: that helps provide sensible levels of freedom::: privacy::: and security can also be the tools of tyranny.

"Since the spring::: Americans have quit their jobs and not returned to the workforce at a historic rate::: an exodus dubbed “The Great Resignation.”

NEWS.HARVARD.EDU
Harvard economist sheds light on ‘Great Resignation’",10/21/21 14:25,Dear Harvard University::: we would be happy to offer these people proper jobs here in Norway.,Excess unemployment benefits for over a year didn't hurt.,But a friend of mine just went to work. His benefits stopped in Sept.,People are becoming more anxious-but those who enjoy their jobs or are passionate about them-usually stay put.

CAPITALISM SHOULD BE ON SOCIETY'S TERMS

Many in society have been taught to believe that the public has no right to tell corporations what to do with their money any more than a private citizen has the right to tell his neighbor what to do with the money he earns from a business or store. This is not a fair analogy.

True enough that a private citizen doesn’t have the right to tell his neighbor what to do with his money but the public does have the right to tell corporations what to do with their money. Why? Because corporations couldn’t exist without very special and unique government help. Corporations are special legal entities that have unique rights::: privileges::: and protections given by government that ordinary citizens and business owners do not have. And::: since the government in a democracy like ours comes from the people (the majority in society) and it's the people's government that gave corporations their unique rights and privileges::: the people have the right to determine how corporations act and how they spend their money. The majority in a democracy own the franchise of government!

Therefore::: the public has a right to demand something from corporations in exchange for giving corporations the right to exist. Would I not have the right::: even as a private citizen::: to demand something from a business built on my property? The same logic applies to the relationship between the public (society) and corporations. Corporations cannot hide behind the specious argument of rugged individualism!

Many in our society have been brainwashed to believe that an absolutely free marketplace with no government controls or regulations would automatically fix our nation’s problems. Have we forgotten already that the Great Depression of the early 1930s was the direct result of a free market economy with no government control or regulation? The 2008 market crash was because of lack of enough government regulation in capitalism::: and if government hadn't intervened to rescue the banks capitalism would have ended in our country and we would have all starved to death. That's right!

Rugged individualism teaches that the individual has the right to benefit from social and economic interactions with society::: but that society has no right to demand any benefit from the individual.

No one has absolute individual rights in society. Those who want absolute individual rights must live outside of society. Those who want to be part of society with the benefits of government and law must be willing to grant what the majority want::: even if it’s at their own expense.

Yes::: minorities have rights::: but the majority has more rights. Absolute individualism is absolutely unfair. The majority has the right to tax an individual and collect money to build a park even if that individual doesn’t want the park and will never use the park. The majority has a right to tax an individual and use the money to provide welfare or help to those who genuinely can’t help themselves in society.

Self-proclaimed
rugged individualists in society want all the benefits of what the majority has to provide - government::: law::: security::: and protection - but they do not want give up anything to the majority in exchange for these benefits. These so-called rugged individualists are the real leeches and parasites of society.

The fact is there are no real rugged individualists in society!

If capitalism and social consciousness cannot coexist::: then how is it that modern industrialized nations such as Canada::: Sweden::: Norway::: Denmark::: and others can have a high degree of social consciousness and still be capitalistic with a thriving free enterprise?

The rich are not paying their fair share of the taxes. Even billionaire Warren Buffet has said that his office secretary pays more in taxes in proportion to her income than he does.

The wealthy and corporations in our country have socked away trillions of dollars (yes::: trillions of dollars) overseas so that their money cannot be taxed. If our government could tax that money::: at a fair and reasonable rate::: we would have enough money in this country to pay for all public services without having to tax the middle class more. We could do a lot for our nation and people.

Strategic taxes on corporations alone would provide plenty of money to provide a safety net for Americans. These corporations won't go broke but can still thrive and grow. They do it in Sweden::: Denmark::: Norway::: Germany::: Canada. They can do it here in the U.S.A.!

The far right wants no controls and regulations on the economy::: and that's what got us in the economic mess in 2008. Without legitimate controls and regulations in the financial markets::: the greedy in our financial world were able to amass huge fortunes through dishonesty and would have totally destroyed all our lives if not for government intervention into the banking and economic system.

Corporations receive special legal status and tax benefits from the government::: which private business owners do not have::: and the government comes from the people (society). So::: corporations do have a duty to the general society and not just to their shareholders. Government should tax corporations to help society as modern and advanced European nations do (i.e. Sweden::: Norway::: Germany).

People can still become wealthy in a socialist society but not at the detrimental expense of others in society. Many of the basic rights::: especially regarding safety in the work place::: that we take for granted were not graciously given to society by the rich but won by the blood of bludgeoned workers and strikers in the early 20th century.

s2/f61314517a",power to the people,"Being the world’s well established and a prestigious university::: the Harvard University has a moral responsibility towards the nations. The common Afghans consider the appointment of Ajmal Ahmady::: the former central bank governor::: former minister of trade and industry::: former senior adviser to the president of Afghanistan Ashraf Ghani ::: as a RESEARCH FELLOW at Harvard University; a disgrace and disrespect towards the Afghan nation. Mr. Ahmady is directly responsible for the current economic crisis in Afghanistan. He could prevent the collapse of Afghanistan banking system and the economy as a whole. While in the central bank::: he intentionally auctioned around USD 2 billion within one year and while the Taliban were advancing and capturing the provinces::: he deliberately transferred cash to the provincial branches of the central bank. There are a thousand examples of misconduct and harm that Ahmady and his boss Ashraf Ghani did in Afghanistan during the past seven years. Yet::: upon his return to the US::: he is appointed as a Research Fellow at World’s most prestigious University without considering his performance and his shameful achievements in Afghanistan.

Everything start from our thinking::: so it's vital that mental health get much attention it deserves.,American citizens have withstood and survived some horrible events in our short history. We have always trusted that our government was working for our safety; that our educational system was ensuring responsible adults. I’m 80 years old…we can no longer assume that government ‘has our backs’.,"Mental health is the issue of every second person. But no one will talk about how to overcome this problem.
We can get rid of this awful problem in many ways
1. Spending time with our family
2. Play with a baby
3. Help random people::: may be on social media
4. Give your candy to poor child
And many other things::: we have mental health issue because we lost our control on ourselves.
Now::: our phone or we can say that social media control us.

My thinking::: what you say",We need to care our mental health,"Mental Health is an issue::: not admitted or accepted asap due to 'social stigma'.

People who are suffering from it tend to hide it due to different factors.
Fear::: doubt::: and shame that you have it.. make people hide it.",YES IT IS TRUE MENTAL HEALTH IS A WORLDWIDE PROBLEM HOWEVER CULTURE REALLY MATTERS TOO. IN MANY AFRICAN COUNTRIES::: EXCEPT MAYBE SOUTH AFRICA ( WHICH IS UNFORTUNATELY::: CULTURALLY WESTERNIZED DUE TO COLONIZATION) ::::::::: THE REST OF AFRICANS BENEFITING FROM THEIR CULTURAL PRACTICES OF LIVING TOGETHER. I WOULD SAY LIVING WITH OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS::: EXTENDED FAMILIY MEMBERS IS THE GREATEST THERAPY WHEN IT COMES TO MENTAL HEALTH. THAT IS WHY MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEM IS NOT A HUGE PROBLEM IN AFRICA WHEN COMPARED TO AMERICA AND OTHER DEVELOPED COUNTRIES.,In this digital age::: mental health is a curious challenge. Hey::: from Unibo. :D,It just illustrates how fragile our brain is.,Mental health is impacted by everything.,My physical health is horrible and I’m isolated but I feel great. I’m like a slightly less smarter Stephen Hawking,Mental health is substantial in people's lives.,Millions of people worldwide have mental health conditions and an estimated ... ten leading causes of disability in both developed and developing countries🧠🫁🫀The question put up here is a rhetorical question.

The theorems of the first being of the universe was the developing of an etherical being. This being was before antimatter who was created by the partion of a photon of light.

Seth or the first extraterrestria
l being is also named as the Diablo because it was the first being to speak about darkness

At our cosmos seth is also associated as the older being of a vital space for the understanding of longevity and the methaphor of the first being

Also is known as the father of pharaoh for the invocations of supreme darkness at Egypt

The fact is that according to the book of the antichrist the candles::: which symbolize sin::: are described with the number 4. The number 4 by cosmological or extraterrestria
l societies is embolized the antichrist or the Pythagoreans.

We wondered if the Devil was created by antimatter because Nazism reflected that he would be the protector of light.

Give a vaccine to my child unless several years of trial has passed.,My daughter is 10 yrs old waiting for the vaccine::: she believes in science. Vaccine can save people's live.,How does a 5 year old tell you they don’t feel themselves::: or can gauge a change in their internal health! At least as older people we can say hey after a took the vaccine I became more confused::: or my headaches are getting worse after the vaccine let me go to the doctor again! Little kids will play not feeling well! We don’t know what the long term affects are to be injecting our future leaders! We already won’t have SSI in the future at least give us health adults for the future. Like they doing to much at this point,My kids will have to decide for themselves to take the vaccine::: taking that they would have to be 18 to make that decision::: you will be waiting for a long time.,Never::: will I Never vaccine my children ...I had the vaccine but a big no for little ones....,"Safe what?...and for what?ah sorry for something that is totally curable if taken on the 1st symptoms and with the right drugs.
Ah sorry:::for something that does nothing on the 95% of the population.
Go and get that::: you journalists.",By the time it's approved 2/3ds of kids will already have a prior infection,Sir I have new ideas::: who I can share with Harvard University.. please guide me about the tips,Just curious if all the deniers actually went to Harvard.

Did any of them ever attend? 😏,We should be more focused on containing the spread. Vaccinating the kids doesn't stop adults from giving it to each other.,Chantix was safe for 15 years,We have to protect ourselves from Covid -just like we protect ourselves from the rain when it’s raining and we wear gloves to protect our hands from hazardous chemicals.,Please define the word “safe”.,"Then why did the doctor in the ER yesterday and our family doctor tell us ""absolutely no"".",Is chantix safe for school children,The truth will prevail,-_- why do you just want children's to get better only?,yeah::: it needs 16 billion dose in production :),Delighted to hear…so many parents have been waiting for this. 🌹,As Winter. approaches I think this virus will be more difficult to control. Simply because of the change in the atmosphere and the changing habits of humans and animals.,No,Everybody sure does have a lot of good things to say about a shot that doesn't work,safe::: but does it work?,Shown vs. proved,As long the FDA has fully approved the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine thus::: the coming days will show more people safely vaccinated. Moreover::: the FDA and CDC continue to carefully monitor each of the authorized COVID-19 vaccines for safety concerns. Blessings.,Thanks our campus,Maria Lee Navarette,With such graduates as Cruz and DeSantos spewing the lies about mask mandates and Covid vaccines::: your university is becoming the laughing stock of our country.

d/","is this why you're taking all classes online as ""breakthrough cases"" surge despite your 95% vaccination rate? wow::: it's almost is if...the vaccine is total bυllshit.",Rubbish.,Step by step are puting ideas to be acepted,And how are the side effects would be as compared to the second dose? I am a covid survivor fully vaxxed but Im not sure the side effects could be handled by children. When I had my second shot::: I had all the side effects. Will never forget those 6hrs chills::: pains.,Before ''Warp speed'' it took 2-5 years to develop a vaccine because of the studies needed to prove safety... I chose to be a guinea-pig and took 2 shots of Moderna:::no bad side effects for me wich is great! I would wait a while before testing these on kids! They are not at risk of severe illness and if most adults have the shots:::what is the problem? Am I making any sense?🤔,Me::: my SO::: my ex::: and four of our six kids are vaccinated. We are fine. We also still wear a mask and social distance because we know we can still contract the virus and spread it. We got the vaccine not only to protect us from dying::: but so that we would not inundate the hospitals. we care about others.,If you people here do not trust science or doctors::: why are you following this page? Go be ignorant in your own bubble.,Erika Mae Mancia,Nice to see Harvard University playing its part in the propaganda machine.,Nope! Not on my kids!,"https://

The coronavirus itself. There is absolutely no justification for injecting kids with this stuff. The benefits versus the risk are completely negligible.,Some folks won’t get the vaccine but they buy over the counter meds..,Néstor Rotsen,Big NO!,🌻,🤢🤢🤢,Poor Senyorita,disgusting.,"Patrick Holming

وائل المالكي",Do it ! 🐑💉,It’s not safe for anyone,Thank you for sharing,Do you know or research how many people had a heart attack and experienced a lot of dangerous side effects after get vaccinated?,Shown to be effective? They just started giving it to kids and they are only in phase 3 of clinical trials. It’s no where near proven or even studied. You should hold yourself to a higher standard Harvard.,Sheyla,Lol,Right because Pfizer don’t have a vested interest in selling more vaccines. Can we have someone independent with no vested bias in their company verify their claims?,And the next day he’s going to suicide himself,Lear Bertuso,Vincent Cheung ffs,How the heck do you know this? It hasn’t been tested long enough. Was this statement made before all the myocarditis issues in young males after the 💉? Leave the healthy 99.9% chance of recovery people alone!,Denis Barengolts,Ryan Holland,#notmychild,That’s foolish. Kids have a higher likelihood of being killed by lightning than Covid. The Covid vaccine actually has more risk to kids than getting Covid. This is a non scientific money and power grab. It’s shameful. Just like your ongoing support of a political narrative backed by ZERO science or data.,Sheila Hernandez,Y’all are commenting absurdities on Harvard’s post. Looking even stupider than usual. 🤣🤣🤣,You have to be an extremely unhinged individual to try this experiment on your children. These poor children should be taken from these abusive “parents”. #NotMyChild,Because if school age children got Covid::: they would only have a 99.9999% chance of survival. Much better to get the vaccine and get a heart attack instead.,This vax is not adequately tested::: and children have a potentially full life ahead of them. NEVER! I am not a Republican::: but am very jaded concerning some of these globalistic groups. If I had a child ...NEVER!,Can’t. Wait!,Meanwhile Pfizer recall products to help with quitting smoking because of multiple cancer causing ingredients::: after years of being deemed safe...,Beautifulest,Can Seth Meyers present it?,Shelly De Jong Wendt,#notmychild,People still trust the FDA? Shocking!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They’ve got it all together:::’” said Hill. “Warmth::: love::: and care::: and all those warm feelings that we sometimes think teens don’t need — they need them more than ever.”,"Either way it swings I'm sure Harvard will ace through the challenges 🙂🙂😁

Breathing freely is so important::: especially if you’re in development as a child.,Get involved by becoming more supportive.,BAD SHOT is a Badshot I got my Pride and Confidence in my decisions in life.,Please for the sanity of teachers if the school calls you to pick up your child (coughing sneezing etc) do not fight with them and be a parent and pick them up.

"A series of surveys conducted by the the COVID States Project between April 2020 and July 2021 found that not only do people believe false claims about COVID-19 vaccinations::: they are also more likely to jeopardize their health because of the misinformation.

E7HUabio","The FDA has a multitude of recalls past and present that were at one time approved. Not only approved for use but some were injected or implanted and recalled after so many people suffered injury. I trusted my Dr when I was implanted with a medical device. It was later recalled for causing cancer of the immune system. Was I misinformed? No::: I was told it was safe. My Dr's assured me it was safe. It wasn't safe but the Dr's go by what the FDA says like when they said opiates were safe until people started dropping like flies and who went to jail? The Dr's who prescribed them. What about the steroid injection I had put in my shoulder that a month later the FDA recalled for contamination? Recalls are public information and my point is that FDA approves stuff then they recall those same approvals. Which one will it be? If the testing was so rigorous then how was a medical device approved on 2006::: adverse reports pilling in 2011::: Dr's notified in 2016 and the public didn't know until an official recall notice in 2020. So in one year they can tell somethings safe? What type of sorcery is that? Are you trying to say in one year the FDA can prove safety? If thats the case then they are liable to alot of people for allowing unsafe (recalled) medical devices and medications to remain on the market so long before recalling. In fact those unsafe products would never have made it to market if safety was truly revealed in just one year. Im not trying to influence anyone but don't assume people are so malleable to depend on social media to make medical choices. Sometimes I wonder if Harvard is selling tickets to the show. If you think people are misinformed then inform them and equip them with the whole truth and nothing but the truth. The FDA makes mistakes and alot of them. If thats not the truth then there is corruption inside the FDA and someones selling approval stamps on alot of stuff! Which one is the truth or are they both truths? The problem isn't misinformation.
The problem is a lack of trust. Opiates are safe enough to make billions but people died so there you go::: who would trust the FDA after that fiasco.","Smart people are always amazed at the complete logical illiteracy of such statements under the sauce of scientific medicine. People still do not know what the reality of being is. But they try to pass themselves off as knowing ones by manipulating others. Medicine has never been an exact science. Let's ask the most important question::: discarding all medico-politica

Where does their a priori free will live in people in this beautiful::: wonderful world?",Jae Chi friend😂,Finally found it. Do you remember dear Prof. Ley?

"The CDC confirmed what Harvard-affiliated physicians had previously thought: the Delta variant not only spreads more rapidly than other versions of the virus::: it can sicken vaccinated individuals.

NEWS.HARVARD.EDU
Harvard experts stress testing::: vaccination amid Delta surge",8/4/21 14:00,"What happened to just flattening the curve? The shut downs were originally implemented to keep healthcare facilities from being overwhelmed::: and we have accomplished this. And now it's being politically exploited to the Nth degree.
Sickens me (pardon the pun)!",This is the most wicked virus and it is constantly evolving... stay safe out there folks! 💚,"I wonder if the next vaccine can be administered through orally..because
it seems like our throats are main area of the virus intervention",People doesn’t read the article and spread the news without knowing exactly what was saying.,Here is a question would people consider a vaccination in 💊 pill form if it were available would that help change your mind to get vaccinated,A lot of us ALREADY knew that when the vaccine came out TOO EARLY. 😎,By the way::: there has always been so much space around me that I can live with my mind without being infected by other people's thoughts....,I'm fully onboard with dart gunning the vaccine into people like we're tagging lions on the Serengeti.,WHY did they abandon the testing protocols?,"The hospitalization
rate among fully vaccinated people with COVID-19 ranged from effectively zero (0.00%) in California::: Delaware::: D.C.::: Indiana::: New Jersey::: New Mexico::: Vermont::: and Virginia to 0.06% in Arkansas.",Im not knowing what to think. Is it true? Or only an opportunity for add us fear?,So does the vaccination sucks?),I pointed this out to people when the vaccines were emerging amidst variants being detected. I'm not at all surprised.,Harvard University It really doesn’t help when you included “it can sicken vaccinated people” in the caption but leave out even more important points on people don’t get as sick. Nowadays many people don’t read articles. This format really doesn’t help with combating antivax misinformation,I know y’all feel dumb taking that vaccine now…. This is just the beginning. Wait till y’all find out what else that vaccine gone do.,"So basically it's useless to vaccinate because we'll still be susceptible to the Delta variant.

Then what's the major objective of getting vaccine?","Soooo what's the difference now? Vaccinated vs unvaccinated. Same boat. News pushing DELTA DELTA DELTA. So how will schools open if it's not working?

-A concerned teacher..",mild sicken / not hospitalize - we can deal with that as experienced adults at home.,"At this point::: with your information and details on the new variant::: why get the vaccine::: if i’m going to get the new variant anyways??
Just doesn’t make sense.
No thanks.",So the vaccine worth nothing why did we get vaccinated and why would we get vaccinated again,Public trust is low people. Especially of the 3 letter organizations.,It is very disheartening to read so many ignorant comments about vaccinations on this post. The people are reacting to a headline instead of reading the entire story before responding.,Irresponsible headline. Symptoms are far milder::: if they emerge at all::: in the vaccinated.,"Vaccine protects froms falling sivk to some extent.Importan
tly it prevents severe form of the disease or death. And it applies to all the vaccines made so far",So vaccinated people should do what again,No one trusts these “experts” anymore.,"Vaxxed or unvaxxed::: just wear the mask. #'s are rising for all::: so why not just protect self and others🤷‍♀️ if you ride a bike you wear a helmet to protect against head injury::: ""just in case""::: if you're in a car or plane you wear a seat belt:::"" just in case""::: you pay for insurance (life::: health::: home::: renters) ""just in case"". So wear the mask...""just in case."" I wear 2 masks...I have vulnerable people in my home and I would rather be safe than sorry.",Oceania was on lockdown::: Oceania has always been on lockdown.,"What about elipson ????

The next virus ??? 😂😂😂😂","Greetings::: Ladies and Gentlemen;we are grieved by the kidnap of our political activist Fred Kajubi Lumbuye::: based inbTurkey.We can't imagine that you wish to partner the shading of innocent blood by African politicians who demand deporting on opposition activists who flee their motherlands for safety.I'll be grateful if you consider my query.

Virus replication depends on Proteases::: which require an acid medium::: Alkalinity inhibits it::: inhibiting all viruses... you should find a way to go Alkaline::: song dance whatever stimulates your liver,"She looks as if she has perfected the concerned look.
They love us so much.
We just need to bend the curve. 🇺🇸",I think a new vaccine is being made now to be used in the next days .,We need a new bill relief,must be erradicated as salk and Sbin were successful,I dont think so. How they learn about this?,I hope there's no Sigma variant lurking anywhere. Delta is too troublesome already.,This is a joke… only idiots buy into this crap,I do not want anything to do with anything Bill Gates has any handgun,Yes::: but less sick. My SIL::: whom is high risk from chemotherapy::: got sick from it but without the vaxx would have been far worse.,Weird England had this and shared this info for that last several months.,Is there any way to differentiate in testing between the delta variant and other strains? 👀,Well when I get a flu shot and still get the flu…..why are we not shocked then.,Mandatory Vaccination is the stepping stone to mandatory Verichip (rfid) implants on all human.,Hey Harvard University! How is that Molecules and Qi Fraternity coming along? 😉👌,Very funny...

didnt know what elsevto say","WHY ARE YOU NOT TALKING ABOUT ESSENTIAL OILS? -\-\Essential oils (EOs) are comprised of a complex mixture of volatile phytochemicals from diverse classes including monoterpenes::: sesquiterpenes:::
and phenylpropanoid
s. Numerous researchers have studied the antibacterial::: antifungal::: antioxidant::: and antiviral properties of EOs. These EOs are found to be active against a wide variety of viruses::: such as influenza virus (IFV)::: human herpesviruses (HSV)::: human immunodeficienc
y virus (HIV)::: yellow fever virus::: and avian influenza (Ma and Yao 2020). HSV (-1 and -2) are known to cause many life-threatenin
g diseases in humans and are one of the major reasons for mortality in immunocompromis
ed patients. HSV-1 is majorly responsible for HSV-induced lesions in the oral cavity and epidermis::: while HSV-2 causes genital herpes::: a sexually transmitted disease. An in vitro study conducted by Schnitzler and colleagues showed that lemon balm oil inhibited plague formation of HSV-1 and HSV-2 viruses in a dose-dependent fashion. Moreover::: at higher concentrations it abolished the viral infectivity almost completely (Schnitzler et al. 2008). Pre-treatment with EOs obtained from illicium verum::: Melaleuca alternifolia::: Leptospermum scoparium::: and Matricaria recutita was found to inhibit the infective ability of acyclovir-sensi
tive and -resistant HSV stains::: indicating the immense antiviral potential of EOs (Schnitzler et al. 2010). Anti-IFV properties of liquid and vapour forms of EOs obtained from various plant species were studied using in vitro techniques. Vapours of EOs obtained from Citrus bergamia::: Eucalyptus globulus::: and their isolated compounds::: i.e. citronellol and eugenol showed rapid anti-IFV actions. While in liquid form::: EOs obtained from Cinnamomum zeylanicum::: Citrus bergamia::: Cymbopogon flexuosus::: and Thymus vulgaris showed better anti-IFV properties i.e. 100% inhibitory activity at 3.1 µL/mL as compared with others. Vapour form of EOs was also found to be safe against monolayers of epithelial cells. The study concluded that EOs in vapour form could benefit people suffering from influenza (Vimalanathan and Hudson 2014). Carvacrol and its isomer thymol obtained from oregano have been shown to inhibit viral host cell fusion via depletion of viral cholesterol from the HIV-1 envelope membranes::: thus blocking the entry of the virus into the host system (Mediouni et al. 2020).
Owing to the lipophilic nature of EOs::: these have the potential to intercalate into the lipid double layer of the viral envelope. Subsequently::: the fluidity of the membranes is changed and::: at a higher concentration::: the membranes are even ruptured (Wink 2020). Major mechanisms through which EOs induce antiviral actions are::: direct actions on free viruses::: inhibition of steps involved in virus attachment::: penetration::: intracellular replication::: and release from host cells and inhibition of vital viral enzymes (Ma and Yao 2020; Schnitzler et al. 2010). Keeping in view the diverse antiviral actions of EOs::: various claims were made by the EOs manufacturers/
suppliers as an effective therapy against COVID-19. In this regard::: research activities were conducted to check the anti-SARC-CoV-2
efficacies of EOs. The current review compiles available scientific information about the possible beneficial effects of EOs in COVID-19.

I’d like to see the numbers that show the likelihood of a person who already had Covid getting it again. I understand the vaccine push for the unvaccinated who haven’t gotten the virus. However::: there needs to be more acknowledgment of natural immunity from having the virus. If you’ve had the virus and safely recovered you shouldn’t be treated like a threat to society for not being convinced of your need to receive the vaccine.","DELTA=VACCINATE

Call any testing facility they will tell you THERE IS NO WAY TO TEST FOR IT","Getting vaccinated is still better than not getting vaccinated!

It’s very irresponsible to think that just because the delta variant can still make vaccinated individuals sick it’s okay not to. If you are vaccinated you will not get as sick as someone that is. Plus there will be a 3rd booster shot that will help protect even more.

"There are lessons we can learn from the example set by Biles::: Osaka::: and other athletes who are putting their mental health and safety first.

NEWS.HARVARD.EDU
A Harvard psychologist’s perspective on Biles at the Olympics",7/30/21 20:45,"She wouldn’t have got even quarter of the total attention::: had she won all the golds in all the events!

It’s okay to seek help and not continue with the sports at any point. But why in the first place you had had to go in and participate and then pull out just like that? She might as well have stayed back home and undergone treatment.

It kind of gives off a vibe that it’s all premeditated and part of something larger!
However::: patients of all sorts do need supports and must be evaluated with sympathetic gestures!",A professional athlete should be trained to manage its stress levels and keep it together at the critical moments. Same goes for any professional. I would say she is an example to avoid. Strive to hone your skills without neglecting your mental ones.,Did anyone ask for this perspective?! 🤨 honestly::: just curious?!,Age is a big factor 27/28 vrs 17/18 years. Youth in sports is very hard to beat. A realization becomes evident::: and can affect one mentally::: as one realizes that they no longer measure up! 😰,Why dose it take a athlete or it being shown on TV how bad mental health can be ? And how it afects people im in an out of work because how im treated afects my mental health and other things going on like cms putting me in 6k of fules arrears for times I was not working fighting this for 7 years but yet thers no help and they don't care about the afects it has done to me still figting but not much more I can take so many going through ther own battles every day and not appreciated for that struggle just getting up to go to the same job ware you feel presured and replaceable 🤷‍♂️,Hmmm. Just wondering how many sessions he's had with her.,"""GAZETTE: What happens to the body when stress and anxiety overwhelm us?

HOLLANDER: Your cortisol levels go up and your entire body is now hypervigilant to the point where you’re actually making mistakes because you’re hyper-focused on things.""

Which is also well established in education as ""optimal arousal level"" (Yerkes and Dodson law).

aw-1.png",The women who are competing. They are being ignored while all the focus is directed to Simone. Let the competing women have their moments of glory and fame.,Anastasia,I have big respect for Bile ::: a great athlete and I agree that we should put our mental health first::: yes it’s vital but I totally disagree with anyone who will pull out in the middle of a competitive competition. You should have put your mental health first ; take care of yourself to allow others to come in your place . Take emotions out of this ; You need to apologise to your country!,Luis Angulo,We've been at our limits for a long time::: Unlike when we find we've already crossed an invisible line::: it's time to stop. Start thinking about ourselves.,It's all well & good::: but most people in the current climate are having some kind of mental issues::: everyone just can't down tools::: although most of them should::: but there's bills to pay::: which always overrides doing something about it.,She should have never taken that spot or opportunity from someone else who would have pushed through the mental hardship.,Sympathize::: yea. It's happened to everyone. Celebrate quitting ? No.,"I can understand this and I don't fault Biles for pulling out of the Olympics. Good judgement and shows an incredible amount of maturity and discipline. Kudos.
... Golfers get a case of the ""yips"" and it can take a while to get ride of them. The only difference is::: a golfer can't get seriously injured by the yips.",So if we work at anything too hard and get so good at sports it takes a toll::: we are just that way. Too much of a good thing is hard to handel ::: yes we worry. About getting enough sleep :::about. Getting a twisted ankel::: whatever ::: when we are nervous our nerves get a workout too. So it's tough to be in competition::: is it worth knowing who is the best worldwide. Is it?,Yes making Exercises makes our bodies clean,"I proud of her
She is do the right thing🙏
I stand with her💪",Poor Simone… she’s such an icon,Certainly::: your health is your priority.,Still not a hero though,Mental health important part for every game,Nice,I praise this young woman. I know this decision had to weigh hard on her to make. Most people who have never competed on a platform don’t understand the stress that comes with it especially this young woman who had to do on a world stage under the microscope since being a sexual assault victim to now the Olympics. She’s still a hero in my books. I wish her the best and I know her future will still be very bright.,🙏😍,It highlights an issue that should be included in athlete training but it should not dull the special spirit that creates these amazing athletes.,Realising the competition is just as qualified if not more this is a valid excuse..more will follow::: the attention seeking behaviour is evident in all statements. Mental health issues do not JUST happen..,I'm really impressed with your kind decision you took::: putting your mental health and safety can never be overestimated. Your pervasiveness will generate a lot of reactions but believe me you did the right thing.,"one piece of salient contextual info that needs to be seen & recognized: https://

Time likes to do personal projects and researches during spare time::: even had a dream to be a somewhat remembered character of some sort of hero.

Time worked so hard and finally developed a whole system for the organization and those guys ""successfully"" rolled out the whole thing to the world.
Many many centuries after::: Time was still alive but about to be put into jail for what had been done that seriously damaged the life and thinking capabilities of the creatures in this universe. The damage caused by that roll-out includes but not limited to depression::: worries::: shorter life periods::: lack of efficiency & productivity::: diseases::: poverty and etc.
Time did not alone roll out the system designed but truly ""invented"" that famous system by using complex math models::: the name of the system(technolo

"Just how dangerous is the Delta COVID variant? William Hanage::: associate professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health::: has characterized the emergence as dire.

NEWS.HARVARD.EDU
Harvard Chan School professor discusses Delta variant",7/17/21 14:20,"It's literally a tragedy when ""experts"" allow ""science"" and politics to coalesce.","Get vaccinated.
To prevent this variant.",science should blamed maybe change in life style or nutrition era,"'The Delta variant is a change variant.
Delta signifies change.
A small triangle depicts the word change.'",The expensive private schools a no no as well. Not for the unfortunate. 🏫🎒🏫 education.,Respect to Harvard University 🙏,Looks more like vaccination campaign motivation.,Honor Harvard University..,Yes,Yawn 🥱,"Even though vaccines offer different ranges of protection:::expe
rts say getting fully vaccinated is crucial.",How far are they willing to go with this dynamic variation of the virus?focus on elimination::: stop chasing after the virus.,I wouldn't go to this college if u are telling everyone they have to take the jab. Let students decide what tvey want,Watching good news today thank you,Yes::: this new variant is becoming a threat::: we should focus on vaccination and measures of prevention during a period of time untel his cycle of contamination Wil be Brock up,I am afraid about children of the world. They are already depressed in their homes.,"Joe beidn quote ""Vaxxed or masked"" 👎👎👎

Some times its not necessary to showcase that we are elder brother. Unfortunately he did that",The tva is coming for it,wish the virus can leave us soon,one no longer knows what to think 🤷🏻‍♀️🙄,Yeah::: delta really took sharing the love to the next level 🙄,ตาสอร์ อะนะ,Stop those tests and there will be no covid anymore😊,Kolunio Maximus,😱,Petr Ludwig,OMG,🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣,Respect to Harvard University 👍,Wear ur mask and taje ur vaccine,Such stupid comments.,The death rate doesn't increase with the variant.,Pooja Manne,Thanks for sharing . 😘,Hello,Prune it please,Jackeline Hernández,"How would SARS COV 2 with narratives=COVI

Sadly along with thousands of innocents who will become further victims of Republican ignorance.,still there is no vaccine made that will completely destroy covid from human body i guess this pandamic will completely over after 50 years not lying but true like spanish flue and others virus,"(B.A. Bible/Biology)*

VIRUSES MAY BE ""offshoots"" of life::: and::: literally::: trillions of years wouldn't be enough time for the sequence of molecules found in the “simple” DNA::: RNA::: and proteins of a virus to come into existence by chance. In fact::: DNA cannot come into existence without RNA and proteins. All three are mutually dependent. One cannot come into existence without the other two. The fact that some viruses have only DNA while others only have RNA is evidence that they are offshoots of living organisms::: which have both. A virus depends on a living organism to replicate::: further evidence that viruses are offshoots of living organisms::: not their precursors.

But than you'll need a booster::: or a double booster::: but you still might get sick and it will potentially not make you safe from other variants::: and if you get the shot you'll still need to wear your mask. Oh by the way::: there are numerous potential serious risks from the vaccine but the reward is worth it. 🤷‍♂️🤦‍♂️

Mental health professionals push slow return post-COVID",7/12/21 19:30,"Evolution is a natural phenomenon; we evolved towards remote work (and it was about time) and digitalisation.

A slow entry back is essential.,May this idea be true not politicians to defile it,have psychologists been able to offer their services during COVID-19?,When is all these going to be over??,Clya Mitztoo,Ok,Oj,😒,Airmes Patcharasak,"Most of us want to be happy. We want to be content::: live in ease::: enjoy the company of our friends and family::: and not be bogged down with the stresses and strains of daily living. This is why if you were to ask the average person why they want to get a good job::: they would probably reply::: ‘to earn enough to live comfortably’. If you questioned them further and asked why they want to live comfortably::: they would say – just like the rest of us – ‘because I want to be happy’. Happiness is an end::: not a means. It is the final destination::: not the journey. We all want to be happy::: and we seek ways to ensure that we achieve a happy state.

What makes people happy varies from one person to the next: some work away for years to add degrees and career credentials to their names; some work night and day to achieve that perfect figure; some want the comforting love of a spouse or bustle of a family; some go wild with friends every weekend after a tough week at work; some devour lifestyle magazines to get a home looking up to standard; the list is endless. Whether it’s through money::: status::: other people or just a good time – everybody is involved in trying to ‘get happy’::: live happy::: and eventually just BE happy. Which begs the question::: what is true happiness? If it exists::: where does it lie and how do we get there?

To answer these questions consider the following. Imagine that while reading this you have been sedated against your will. Suddenly you wake up and find yourself on a plane. You are in first class. You have your own cabin. The food is heavenly. The seat is a flatbed::: designed for a luxurious comfortable experience. The entertainment is limitless. The service is out of this world. You start to enjoy all of the facilities. Think for a moment::: and ask yourself this question: am I happy?

How can you be… you need some questions answered first. How did you even get on the plane? Where is it headed to? If these questions remain unanswered::: how can you ever be happy? Even if you started to enjoy all of the luxuries at your disposal::: you would never achieve true happiness. Would that frothy Belgian chocolate mousse on your dessert tray be enough to drown out the questions? It would be a delusion::: a fake type of happiness::: only achievable by deliberately ignoring and suspending these critical questions.

Apply this to your life. Now ask yourself::: am I happy?

Our coming into existence is no different to being sedated and thrown on a plane. We never chose our birth. Yet some of us do not ask the questions or search for the answers that will help us achieve our ultimate goal: happiness.",👍👌,Great initiative,Thank you am watching,Great,That day is on the way...,How are you doing ferdi,Can you gI pick,Can you gI pick,Dayana Padilla Yepez,Hello,"https://

NEWS.HARVARD.EDU
edX acquired by education technology company 2U",6/29/21 13:15,Thanks Harvard!! We have to haterproof to keep haters from sabotaging grades.,Wonderful news! I can't thank you enough for putting some really high quality courses on this platform completely for free for millions of learners around the globe who can't afford an Ivy League education. Here's hoping that this move increases the variety of courses - especially those related to Management education.,I've a concept for a social net. Could be big. Wish I was at Harvard where could hook up with a coder to build the platform. Like Facebook::: like only take a couple weeks to build then post up online. Be cool to run it through the Harvard Canvas first to trial run it. Think that approach really helped Facebook to skyrocket right off from out of the gates.,"This is atrocious. 2U pricing for content is completely inaccessible to the vast majority of EdX users::: meaning a platform designed to increase educational access and affordability will literally now work to exacerbate existing inequalities (by allowing well paid knowledge workers or cost agnostic students to further increase the distance between themselves and others). The fact that the proceeds of the sale will support nebulous other social ends is of little consolation.

My prediction is many content partners will pull out or cease collaboration akin to what has happened with Coursera. We will go back to a patchwork of online certificates and degrees (with substantially higher costs due to a lack of economies of scale and premium pricing for premium schools… see Cornell Online and Columbia Video Network for both points).

Meanwhile::: 2U’s fledgling rival Get Smarter already shows how a private aggregator in higher ed digital content works in action. Aggressively priced content from the few schools that can command high prices…",2U is a shady for profit organisation going against what edX was all about. At least there is still Coursera.,"There's no way 2U wouldn't double the $49 or $99 minimum price courses. For low-income earners::: it makes it worse.

Thankfully::: there's FutureLearn whose courses are still affordable::: relatively.",best university,Afghanistan is Zero when it comes to online lessons. 🙂,Congrats! thats a good news for all.,Luzia Gilda,Rosario Ata,Estrellita Punzalan-Bautista,thanks Harvard 😇,Clya Mitztoo,❤,😍,🙏🙏,👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻❤️🇨🇴,100000000%,😍👍👍,"OFFER 📣 🔥

"Researchers found that milk chocolate may be a fat-burner for postmenopausal women.

Eat the chocolate::: lose the weight?",6/24/21 16:10,I have been trying for years,Works for me !,Depends on how much sugar it contains. 20%-40% cacao would do the adverse effect. Wouldn't dark chocolate carry that function instead of milk chocolate?,Yes::: chocolate is great !,"What if objects move in multiple speeds on an orbit? That means one object can change its speed while staying on the original orbit aka without any orbit change. I must say this is a more advanced orbit and more difficult to maneuver. Some concepts to share:
-Orbit Strechness：to measure the speed change within “one” orbit. For example: a car is moving on a straight line::: it may slow down the speed to avoid obstacles::: speeds change while the car is still staying on the same orbit. The same happens to space travel. A designed orbit in space may also slow down somewhere in between::: we can call that orbit strechness.
-Orbit Change/Orbit Shift: to observe one object moving from one orbit to another::: we can say leap::: we can also say orbit change/orbit shift.
Why the concept of orbit is so much important? According to our massive observations in space::: we can say that the universe is built upon orbits::: not forces. The forces we have measured are merely part of the enablers or intermediate factors.",Feigenbaum's constants have been and are when looking at the moon ...

er-class-62",Harvard University is my dream University.,"Crypto-currency
and ""crime"". Louis Gohmert said the ""FBI"" is causing crimes.

Someone hands someone cash to do something::: the person receiving it is likely to understand (historically) that the cash is not traceable back to the person::: not if the person denies it and is not suspected of anything.

Someone with a phone and an app for ""crypto-wallet-
to-crypto-walle
t"" transactions. Can the person receiving be led to believe they will have evidence of who gave them the money and said something was authentic and maybe the transaction did not really occur the way they were led to believe. Maybe syndicates and some already compromised person. Maybe the ""evidence"" will show or suggest::: if it were arranged::: that a transaction occurred between the recipient and some compromised person::: not the person who the recipient thought had authentic credentials. US government probably is allowing too many currency-exchan
ges that work in possibly unmanaged ways. Louis Gohmert: US government is causing crimes::: making them easier::: and there are people who commit crimes whose neurological state truly is that they have no empathy or limited empathy for other people -\-\ it's not a majority of people::: but maybe some people are like that and people sometimes find places where they have advantages that should not be easily allowed to exist if there's no good reason for them to exist. Some people who have little natural resistance to putting others in harm's way are truly very good at manipulating people and getting them involved in scams and when there's a reward that's in any way more easily attainable than it should be for that::: it empowers such people more than we should probably want overall.

It's basically true::: crypto cannot be erased from existence by any government action::: but governments can act to make things clearer for people. Does the government have any effective control over FCC::: over internet::: over ISPs? Saying things like::: we can never totally eliminate it is not a good reason to not address a problem if there is any problem.",Woderfull,Always amazing!,Any student from here,Definitely!,Chandra Adhikari,Woderfull,Hoàng Thị Kim Anh,"https://

How do your students look at those who are part of Harvard Extension School? Are they viewed as equals::: as hard working Harvard graduates? Or are they looked down on? Many people say that HES is a Harvard school::: and I know it is::: but the fact that there's so much emphasis on it being an online school::: and the fact that all of the degrees offered have horribly generic names::: really have me wondering if HES really is as good as any of the other Harvard schools::: and if being a HES graduate really has the same prestige as say Harvard business School or Harvard Medical School or Harvard School of Divinity.,It's the best of the best Super Teachers,WONDERFUL EDUCATION IS LIFE,Good job::: kids!,"Congratulations

Tracing Amartya Sen’s journey from colonial India to Nobel Prize and beyond",6/6/21 13:05,"""Many economists focus on explaining and predicting what is happening in the world. But Sen::: considered the key figure at the convergence of economics and philosophy::: turned his attention instead to what the reality should be and why we fall short."" This falls within the framework of the traditional philosophical problem between ""sollen"" and ""sein"" since Antiquity and updated by the philosophers of the eighteenth century::: notably Rousseau. From a legal standpoint::: the work of Hans Kelsen falls within the same perspective. Amartya Sen has a genetic approach to problems based on historical analysis. Its approach is then fundamentally complementary to the prospective one.",Great academic and scholar::: Amartya 'Kumar' Sen. He has indeed contributed a lot in the stream of Humanities and Social Sciences.,For me my comment we should know what is happening around the world more especially when we plough the lurce with other countries with differaintal manner,We cannot obtain a clear understanding of what is happening in the world without a deep diagnosis about man and an analysis of what human aspirations are::: because man is the first link in our noisy world,Harvard materials always on the map::: we proud of you all,So much admiration for his work!,Go deeper::: even under the air,"Giving scholarships based on IELTS or toefl scores isn't really a helpful ideas to we striving students wishing to apply.

"From the first ceremony ""at the edge of a wilderness"" to Churchill on campus::: these are some notable past Harvard commencements.

NEWS.HARVARD.EDU
Retiring University archivist shares insight on notable Commencements",5/25/21 20:50,"Let’s look at the concept of infinity again( some thoughts).
Let’s say::: one point on earth moving in a circle::: using the sun as the frame of reference::: the number of orbit changes will be infinite when it moves one circle::: the orbit at this finish line is straight forward at the finish point or the beginning point on the circle. If we just take the beginning point on the circle as the second comparable point::: it also moves by the earth orbit::: if we watch over these two points and control the speeds of these two points to let them be at the same point with the same speed ( sun as reference) when the circle point finished one circle::: then we have something going on here.
The orbit changes of the circle point are the infinitive orbit changes along the circle And the orbit changes along the earth orbit::: while::: the “still” point has only the infinitive orbit changes along the earth orbit which is included in the circle point orbit changes. Thus we have two infinities here. One is the circle shape orbit changes the other is the earth orbit changes. Another thing needs to be noticed is that since we control and watch over the speeds of these two points so that when the circle point finishes one circle::: it will have the same speed as of the still point::: or simply the circle point stops when one circle is finished according to earth perspective. Then the two points will be “dropped” at the exact same orbit when the circle point finishes one circle orbit changes.
My point is that these two infinitives can surely not be ignored to be one infinitive. So next time when we calculate anything related to infinitive::: remember the story of these two points. I am not quite sure about what contents are exactly included in this assumption::: but for sure it exists and for real and not that eligible for being counted as nothing.

"On spring and summer weekends::: Memorial Drive is closed to traffic and open for walking::: biking::: running::: and relaxing.

See more photos: https://hrvd.me/MemDrive50f",5/22/21 15:20,Beautiful view...There is a kind of luck::: which is expressed only in getting to the right place at the right time::: and an inspiration::: which is nothing more than doing what you have to do and how to do it right..,Caroline Louise Cole Paul Yager these photos take me back to our time together at lovely Camden Place and Memorial Drive. Hope you are well!,How good luck...,We will get very soon to NORMAL like before <3,Good luck,Interesting,"The universe is built upon orbits.

Orbits to this universe is like fixtures to buildings. Orbits are also somewhat like trees in that they are largely built and designed by the universe itself.
The point I am trying to express is that the universe is not built upon force::: the things we used to relate to force should be directly related to orbits. Gravity is about orbits::: horsepower is about orbits::: even emotion is about orbits.
The universe is born with orbits::: which can be very complex orbits existing together.

A few necessary terminologies and concepts:
UOC: unchanged orbit constant. UOC is not definitely ineligible for change::: just not to be changed at the moment or any timeline in sight; eg: gravity::: gravitational acceleration
TOC: total orbit constant(s): the overall orbit distribution and condition of the orbits in this vast universe
There is no such concept as mass (m)::: it is UOC::: the substance amount of one object is meaningless and also unmeasurable.
electricity light: the existence of all forms of the electricity::: light::: lightning::: radio and etc. Electricity light does not have to have brightness::: it is just one type of existence::: which is very very widely existing in this universe::: it is common existence it is also very advanced existence::: as well as that it is extremely useful and deep/complex/
even somewhat mysterious in its functions. The mystery of electricity light is comparable to that of a living organic. It is the fact and truth just like the birth of this universe::: the constitution of a human body::: the living and growing of a tree. The basic function of electricity light is carrying messages or information.
orbit key: the stuff that is used to change orbit(s)::: for example: the horsepower to accelerate a car::: the friction to stop a car.

Now let’s turn to the classic laws about force.
Newton I: inertia. It is simply about one object that is on an or various orbit(s) without any instant change.
Newton II: m=G/g::: so it is something=a/g * G(gravity)::: the something here is an existence form of the orbit(s) change::: we can call it the orbit keys::: which is more like a bridge thing not any destination or full stop of any assumptions or theories. Thus the point here is about that the orbit keys here equals to the gravity of the object times the ratio of acceleration and one earth orbit constant (let’s say UOC here::: unchanged orbit constant). And as we all know gravity is measured by spring(s) or things like that.
Newton III: the contact of two surfaces and orbits changes in different directions::: which is not necessarily reversed.
universal gravitation: no need to have this concept or does not exist.
inertial force: multiple orbits change situations aka no such force::: it is merely the change of the related orbits of the objects due to the orbit keys.

The Extremely or Very important assumption:
The universe is not designed for destruction::: it is designed for life and living::: so all of our believes must go to the positive healthy direction/
side::: that is to say: we must believe that the universe is fundamentally healthy::: gorgeous::: unbreakable::: well-run. Proof: we know so little about our universe::: we haven’t even get out of our galaxy::: we are alive till this day::: we prosper and are having fun here::: feeling safe and happy.
This assumption started from the birth of this universe with all of its supporting (fixture) orbits and will not end.",Thanks for sharing::: beautiful place and a lot of happy people.,one day I will walk in this campus,Have you found the two exits located between the campus and the society?,A dream to be your student harvard uni! ♥,Nice !,Can’t wait to join you,I will join you as soon as possible in this campus,प्रेमेन्द् राए,Hurrem Mustafa,Good 👍,Salve Villamar,Nice 👍,NICE,Wow,❤️❤️❤️,😃👍🇵🇪🌈👍,❤️🚴‍♀️🚴🤸🏽🧘‍♂️,Tunis Business School :),Where are you??

Also::: if people are giving areas money fir cases::: there is no shortage of poor and starving::: sick people which can be driven into these horrific campaigns and subjected to deadly 'treatments:::' yes. This is partly what happened here in the U.S. in places like NY::: Congress allocated a ton of money for hospitals to get reimbursed for alleged Covid cases and folks were driving uninsured::: poor patients to the hospitals::: I read that was some of what was going on. See how that works? No shortage of potential cases in poor populations.

OUR LIVING WORLD: NOT INVENTED BY NATURE

JUST BECAUSE something exists in nature does not mean it was invented by nature. If all the chemicals (i.e. amino acids::: nucleic acids::: etc.) necessary to make a cell were left to themselves::: “Mother Nature” would have no ability to organize them into a cell. It requires an already existing cell to bring about another cell. The cell exists and reproduces in nature but nature didn’t invent or design it! Nature didn’t originate the cell or any form of life. An intelligent power outside of nature had to be responsible.

Miller::: in his famous experiment in 1953::: showed that amino acids (the building blocks of life) could form by chance. But::: it’s not enough just to have amino acids. The various amino acids that make-up life must link together in a precise sequence::: just like the letters in a sentence::: to form functioning protein molecules. It has never been shown that various amino acids can bind together into a sequence by chance to form protein molecules.

Natural laws may explain how an airplane or cell works::: but it’s not rational to believe that undirected natural laws can bring about an airplane or a cell.

ONCE YOU HAVE a complete and living cell then the genetic program (or code) and biological machinery exist to direct the formation of more cells::: but how could the cell have originated naturally when no directing code and mechanisms existed in nature?

Mathematicians have said any event in the universe with odds of 10 to 50th power or greater is impossible! The probability of just an average size protein molecule arising by chance is 10 to the 65th power. Even the simplest cell is made up of many millions of various protein molecules along with and DNA/RNA..

The late great British scientist Sir Frederick Hoyle calculated that the odds of even the simplest cell coming into existence by chance is 10 to the 40:::000th power! How large is this? Consider that the total number of atoms in our universe is 10 to the 82nd power.

The cell didn't evolve. A partially evolved cell would quickly disintegrate::: not wait millions of years to become complete and living.

WHAT ABOUT EVOLUTION? Only evolution within “kinds” is genetically possible (i.e. varieties of dogs::: cats::: horses::: cows::: etc.)::: but not evolution across “kinds” (i.e. from sea sponge to human). How could species have survived if their vital tissues::: organs::: reproductive systems were still evolving? Survival of the fittest would actually have prevented such evolution! Only limited evolution::: variations of already existing genes and traits::: is possible. Nature is mindless and has no ability to design and program entirely new genes for entirely new traits.

WHAT ABOUT NEW SPECIES: Although new species have come into existence::: they don't carry any new genes. They've become new species only because they can't be crossed back with the original parent stock for various biological reasons. A biological ""kind"" allows for new species but not new genes. Nature has no ability to invent new genes for new traits. Only limited variations and adaptations are possible in nature::: and all strictly within a biological ""kind"" (i.e. varieties of dogs::: cats::: etc.).

All species of plants and animals in the fossil record are found complete::: fully formed::: and fully functional. This is powerful evidence that all species came into existence as complete and fully formed from the beginning. This is only possible by creation.

What about natural selection? Natural selection doesn't produce biological traits or variations. It can only ""select"" from biological variations that are possible and which have survival value. That’s why it’s called natural “selection.” The real issue is what biological variations are possible::: not natural selection. Only variations and mutations of already existing genes or traits are possible.

Dr. Randy J. Guliuzza’s extensive research points to a better explanation than natural selection for variation and adaptation in nature. Dr. Guliuzza explains that species have pre-engineered mechanisms that enable organisms to continuously track and respond to environmental changes with system elements that correspond to human-designed tracking systems. This model is called CET (continuous environmental tracking). His research strongly indicates that living things have been pre-engineered to produce the right adaptations and changes required to live in changing environments. It’s much like a car that’s been pre-engineered so that the head lights turn on automatically when day changes to night.

Modern evolutionists believe and hope that over::: supposedly::: millions of years::: random mutations in the genetic code caused by environmental radiation will generate entirely new genes for natural selection to use. This is total blind and irrational faith on the part of evolutionists. It’s much like believing that randomly changing the sequence of letters in a romance novel::: over millions of years::: will turn it into a book on astronomy! That’s the kind of blind faith macro-evolution
ists have.

Mutations are accidents in the genetic::: are mostly harmful::: and have no capability of producing greater complexity in the code. Even if a good accident occurred::: for every good one there would be hundreds of harmful ones with the net result::: over time::: being harmful::: even lethal::: to the species. Even if a single mutation is not immediately harmful::: the accumulation of mutations over time will be harmful. At best::: mutations only produce further variations within a natural species. Most biological variations are not due to mutations but from new combinations of already existing genes.

What about genetic and biological similarities between species? Genetic information::: like other forms of information::: cannot happen by chance::: so it is more logical to believe that genetic and biological similarities between all forms of life are due to a common Designer who designed similar functions for similar purposes. It doesn't mean all forms of life are biologically related! Only genetic similarities within a natural species proves relationship because it's only within a natural species that members can interbreed and reproduce.

The actual similarity between ape and human DNA is between 70-87% not 99.8% as commonly believed. The original research stating 99.8% similarity was based on ignoring contradicting evidence. Only a certain segment of DNA between apes and humans was compared::: not the entire DNA genome.

All the fossils that have been used to support human evolution have been found to be either hoaxes::: non-human::: or human::: but not non-human and human (i.e. Neanderthal Man was discovered later to be fully human).

There has never been unanimous agreement among evolutionary scientists on ANY fossil evidence that has been used to support human evolution over the Many years::: Including LUCY.

Also::: so-called ""Junk DNA"" isn't junk. Although these ""non-coding"" segments of DNA don't code for proteins::: they have recently been found to be vital in regulating gene expression (i.e. when::: where::: and how genes are expressed::: so they're not ""junk"").

"The goal of the Houghton Library renovation project was to make the building more accessible and welcoming::: while also enhancing research and teaching spaces.

Photos: Stephanie Mitchell/Harvard Staff Photographer",4/17/21 15:00,The only thing I hate about upgrading historical buildings is you remove parts of the history of the building to do the upgrades. A lot of the buildings on Harvard’s campus are so beautiful and hold so much history.,I sure hope the library is open this coming year ...as a new student::: this would be a great experience!!,Harvard has one of the most beautiful libraries in the world.,One the problems of Harvard:::is that they don't like mixing British and American English,Great Idea 😎,i wanna study in Harvard University .Is there scholarship available 😊😊,"In the newly renovated Houghton Library::: the building’s original details now pair with modern enhancements. Sleek::: lighted display cases line the walls of the freshly painted foyer::: letting visitors easily engage with collection items. Large overhead lamps glow above gleaming wooden tables in the reading room::: which boasts a new group study room to encourage collaborative work. An inviting plaza in front connects to wheelchair-acce
ssible paths at the building’s entrance::: and a new elevator::: restrooms::: and other features vastly improve the building’s physical accessibility.

The only missing piece is the library’s patrons and visitors — but when it is safe to reopen the building::: they’ll find it more welcoming and accessible than ever before.

February marked the completion of Houghton Library’s 16-month project to renovate the world-renowned primary-source research center and teaching laboratory. The renovation was led by Ann Beha Architects in partnership with the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ Office of Physical Resources and Planning.

The lobby is pictured.
The lobby of the renovated library.
While it’s hard not to be able to immediately share the renovated library with visitors::: completing construction during the pandemic is still a milestone::: said Tom Hyry::: the Florence Fearrington Librarian of Houghton Library.

How spanking may affect brain development in children",4/13/21 23:15,Children also deserve respect. It's all about how to balance things for better impact.,For decades::: spanking has been studied and is generally accepted by the scientific community to cause more harm than good. I based the decision not to spank my own children on research available 10 years ago. It’s interesting to now see some scientific measurements as to how much harm spanking might cause.,"If the only way you can deter your child from undesired behavior is through violence than you are a lazy parent in my opinion - mistakes/
misbehaving are teachable moments that require [from the parents] patience::: high emotional intelligence and consistency - if you can’t do this then you can’t teach your kids anything because you yourself are incapable of solving problems and succumb to lower-level behavior",Oh my I’ve been spank by my parents. I never hurt no one. I and my sister graduated university::: have great well paying jobs and have a great relationship with our parents.,Raise your hand those people whom parents never spanked as a child for educational purposes. I see the forest from raised hands:),It's the attention and the balance of how parents give their kids freedom and limitations. It's multifactorial.,"How do you use it?
A. Punish children when they make mistakes
- A1. Punishment by violence
- A2. Punish by shouting
- A3. Punishment by confinement in room
- A4. Punish by confiscation of a toy
- A5. Punish by canceling good promises.
- A6. Punishment by reproach for a long time
- A7. Other sanctions
B. Do nothing when your child makes a mistake
C. Other options",Have been spanked I can't count how many times when I was young..

The peoples who circumcise their babies knew about the reactions of the brain of a child to pain::: so this is not a discovery at all.,"Any crack head group of scientists can come up with a study to ""prove"" just about anything. Disciplining your child is an act if love not violence.

Maybe it's blowing up there now::: but it's been a continous battle::: even within Asian countries for a long time. We just tend to look away and it becomes a norm somehow. Asians are subtle when it comes to discrimination against other asians::: but still::: it is downright degrading other people::: whether by power or violence.

Monkey stands on 2 legs so that the hands can easily catch fish. Monkeys walk on 2 feet to reduce the area of skin exposed to water.
2 monkey hands are more skillful and sensitive because of the job of catching fish.
The monkey's brain is wiser because catching fish requires intelligence rather than muscle strength.
These groups of monkeys have gone extinct. There is only one species left::: called the Humans.

Ohhhh of course::: then you wouldn’t have a convenient scapegoat to blame when Asian Americans are attacked by African Americans and there was no white personal involved whatsoever! My mistake!!,Publicizing it actually doesn't help,Asia is a continent and China is a part of it.

I guess people that like is why Racism is alive & well in America.,Asians are not virus. Those from China who think their communist gov is great are the virus,Ok::: what an article::: but what about the hate against white people? When will address that::: or does it not fit your agenda?,"not all asians are Chinese

There is no hate against Indians :) these protestors should use the correct term ^CHINEESE^ ....since even Indians::: Phillipino and Bhutaneese also hate them :D,Asian are no viruses but the manufacturer viruses,"ROFLMAO

Coming from the University with the most discriminatory admissions toward Asians.

I think a study showed being Asian when applying to Harvard is like having 240 points deducted relative to a white candidate (450 plus vs African American)

"A new study finds that the early climate on Mars fluctuated between warm::: wet spells and long inhospitable periods of cold.

NEWS.HARVARD.EDU
New model offers clearer picture of life on Mars",3/22/21 13:35,I love space news:::this is amazing,Nasa and family::: keep up the great information 👊,"The concept of life:::::::::
We can't help but to question the question of life's existance; flying in on an asteroid from somewhere in the Universe being one of my ponderings from ages past. If life was formed on this planet then it would have had to have been formed by intelligence that had to originate it's self from one point. It doesn't sound like life on Mars would have ever went to an extreme to where it would have added up to much if it had of existed from an asteroid or from some form of creation either. Life on Earth is too hot in the Summer and too cold in the Winter but is capable of life. Mars on the other hand doesn't sound to have been though we simply do not have that information::: otherwise being interesting.","(B.A. Bible/Biology)*

POSSIBLY MILLIONS OF TONS OF VOLCANIC EARTH SOIL REACHED MARS (Newsweek)

A Newsweek article of September 21::: 1998::: p.12 mentions the high possibility of Earth life on Mars because of millions of tons of Earth soil ejected into space from ancient volcanic explosions. ""We think there's about 7 million tons of earth soil sitting on Mars""::: says USC scientist Kenneth Nealson. ""You have to consider the possibility that if we find life on Mars::: it could have come from the Earth"" [Weingarten::: T.::: Newsweek::: September 21::: 1998::: p.12]. This may also explain why life forms may exist on Venus::: again because they originated from Earth.

In the Earth's past there was powerful volcanic activity which could have easily spewed dirt and rocks containing microbes and life into outer space which not only could have eventually reached Mars but also ended up traveling in orbit through space that we now know as meteors::: comets::: and asteroids. This would mean life forms found in meteorites originated from Earth in the first place.

Secular scientists have a different explanation from creationist scientists on the volcanic eruptions of the Earth's past. Creation scientists believe::: as Genesis teaches::: that as the fountains of the deep were opened to release water for the world-wide flood the force of the eruptions could have indeed spewed great amounts of earth soil into space.

Life could not have evolved. A partially evolved cell would quickly disintegrate under the effects of random forces of the environment::: especially without the protection of a complete and fully functioning cell membrane. A partially evolved cell cannot wait millions of years for chance to make it complete and living! In fact::: it couldn't have even reached the partially evolved state.

Having the right conditions and raw material for life do not mean that life can originate or arise by chance. Stanley Miller::: in his famous experiment in 1953::: showed that individual amino acids (the building blocks of life) could come into existence by chance. But::: it's not enough just to have amino acids. The various amino acids that make-up life must link together in a precise sequence::: just like the letters in a sentence::: to form functioning protein molecules. If they're not in the right sequence the protein molecules won't work. It has never been shown that various amino acids can bind together into a sequence by chance to form protein molecules. Even the simplest cell is made up of many millions of various protein molecules.

The probability of just an average size protein molecule arising by chance is 10 to the 65th power. Mathematicians have said any event in the universe with odds of 10 to 50th power or greater is impossible! The late great British scientist Sir Frederick Hoyle calculated that the odds of even the simplest cell coming into existence by chance is 10 to the 40:::000th power! How large is this? Consider that the total number of atoms in our universe is 10 to the 82nd power.

Also::: what many don't realize is that Miller had a laboratory apparatus that shielded and protected the individual amino acids the moment they were formed::: otherwise the amino acids would have quickly disintegrated and been destroyed in the mix of random energy and forces involved in Miller's experiment.

Miller's experiment produced equally both left-handed and right-handed amino acids::: but all living things strictly require only left-handed amino acids. If a right-handed amino acid gets into the chain the protein won't work.

There is no innate chemical tendency for the various amino acids to bond with one another in a sequence. Any one amino acid can just as easily bond with any other. The only reason at all for why the various amino acids bond with one another in a precise sequence in the cells of our bodies is because they're directed to do so by an already existing sequence of molecules found in our genetic code.

Of course::: once you have a complete and living cell then the genetic code and biological machinery exist to direct the formation of more cells::: but how could life or the cell have naturally originated when no directing code and mechanisms existed in nature?

from India",I'm a tunisien girl and I'm a first year english student. I dearm to be a Law student in Harvard so what I should to do,"4 million years ago. Tropical delta plains Many groups of monkeys eat fish.
These monkeys reduce their feathers to avoid being entangled in the water to catch fish. Monkeys reduce hairs like elephants::: water buffalo species::: rhino species to reduce water infiltration into the body.
Monkey stands on 2 legs so that the hands can easily catch fish. Monkeys walk on 2 feet to reduce the area of skin exposed to water.
2 monkey hands are more skillful and sensitive because of the job of catching fish.
The monkey's brain is wiser because catching fish requires intelligence rather than muscle strength.
These groups of monkeys have gone extinct. There is only one species left::: called the Humans.
Today::: graduating Harvard Medical School students gathered online to find out and celebrate where they will spend the next phase of their medical training. Congratulations",I would love to attend school there but I feel like I am too old to even apply,"The Moroccan government has lost its Mind deploying Armed forces to attack teachers in ways you can't even do to your worst enemy .I don't understand how can a teacher who is peacefully asking for his very basic rights impose such a danger to national security that they have to call on the cavalry .

Sign language for quantum science being developed at Harvard",3/11/21 20:55,Now you can learn to talk nerdy with your hands. (socially acceptable communication) Very thought provoking because science has a language issue not only with that::: but the public and as well as within the same field and with paradigm different concepts. (socially unacceptable communication) Field of math has concepts of logical equivalence::: such as zorn's lemma implies axiom of choice::: and axiom of choice implies zorn's lemma::: which applied to physics would say there are many equivalent forms of physics that look strangely different than the current models. (this often invokes angry responses from physicists who think the equations found are an inherit property of the universe::: and not just a mathematical tool that explains it in one of the infinite ways) A few physicists have proven equivalent forms now::: so the field isn't completely devoid of such a concept::: its just a lot of physicists likely have no clue why that research is brilliant and should be awarded. Because it falls outside the typical paradigm::: outside the language norm::: those physicist will likely not be properly awarded for their brilliant work.

essing Professors like the brilliant Dr. Cornel West by not giving them tenure! Shame on you!",you can do your best at harvard. i did over 30 years a friend of mine of mine did 27 years. we both were screud in the end.,How did that work out for NY Governor Andrew Cuomo?,Composition of cognitive structures in human systems...,"I discovered that Dark Matter has density higher than Planck density

“Black Holes in Ferent Quantum Gravity have very small volume”
Adrian Ferent

“Dark Matter has density higher than Planck density”
Adrian Ferent

“Ferent Matter is Dark Matter in Ferent Quantum Gravity”
Adrian Ferent

“I am the first who discovered Dark Matter beyond the Planck Wall”
Adrian Ferent

“Dark Matter has density less than or equal to Ferent density and greater than Planck density”
Adrian Ferent

“I am the first who discovered what is beyond the Planck Wall”
Adrian Ferent

“Two important walls:
The Ferent wall: here at time t = 1.294 × 10^(-86) s were created Dark matter and Dark photons::: with the speed of the Dark photons v = 1.001 × 10^17 m/s.
The Planck wall: here at time t = 5.391 × 10^(-44) s were created Matter and Photons::: with the speed of the Photons c = 2.997 × 10^8 m/s”
Adrian Ferent

This means:

“In Ferent Quantum Gravity Dark Photons and Gravitons is Faster Than Light”
Adrian Ferent

“Einstein general relativity is a wrong Gravitation theory because does not explain what was at Planck Wall and beyond”
Adrian Ferent

Ferent density
Ferent density ρF = mF / lf^3 = 8.94 × 10^181 kg/m3

The volume of the universe:

Mass of the universe: M = 3 × 10^52 kg
The volume of the universe at Planck wall:

VP = M / ρP = 3 × 10^52 kg / 5.155 × 10^96 kg/m^3 = 5.819 × 10^(-45) m^3

The volume of the universe at Ferent wall:

VF = M / ρF = 3 × 10^52 kg / 8.94 × 10^181 kg/m^3 = 3.355 × 10^(-130) m^3

“In Ferent Quantum Gravity theory the mass of supermassive Black Hole from the center of our galaxy is not 8.2 × 10^36 kg::: it is 7.3 × 10^19 kg”
Adrian Ferent

“I am the first who calculated the mass and the energy of a Black Hole”
Adrian Ferent

“Physics is much more complicated than you learned::: with Dark Matter”
Adrian Ferent

This is another proof that Ferent Quantum Gravity theory is right and Einstein Gravitation theory::: String theory::: LQG… are wrong theories.

“Ferent matter has density less than or equal to Ferent density and greater than Planck density”
Adrian Ferent

“Ferent matter is Dark matter in Ferent Quantum Gravity”
Adrian Ferent

“The majority of Dark matter is the core of the supermassive Black holes”
Adrian Ferent

“I am the first who discovered Dark Matter beyond the Planck Wall”
Adrian Ferent

“The energy of the gravitons inside a Black hole::: is much higher than the energy of the gluons”
Adrian Ferent

“Matter was created from Dark Matter”
Adrian Ferent

“The elementary particles contain Dark Matter”
Adrian Ferent

That is why:

“The Standard Model is wrong”
Adrian Ferent

“Ferent equation for elementary particle::: made of 2 particles::: a Matter particle and a Dark Matter particle::: is the Unification between Matter and Dark Matter!”
Adrian Ferent

“Dark Matter interacts only gravitationally
with Matter”
Adrian Ferent

“The most difficult topic in Science is Gravitation::: because Newton::: Einstein… tried to explain it without success”
Adrian Ferent

“Information is lost in Black Holes”
Adrian Ferent

“Because the elementary particles contain Dark Matter with the mass much smaller than particles mass::: Dark Matter is not detected at CERN”
Adrian Ferent

“What you learned from your professors::: from your books::: from the greatest scientists… about Dark Matter is wrong”
Adrian Ferent

“Dark Matter is not ‘invisible’::: is not ‘transparent’ Matter.”
Adrian Ferent

“Light will not cross Dark Matter because Dark Matter density is higher than Planck density.”
Adrian Ferent

When you look at the sky and you do not see Dark Matter::: this means it is ‘invisible’::: is ‘transparent’!
Here are 2 examples::: Lisa Randall professor from Harvard University and Dan Bauer physicist from Fermilab::: of what the professors::: the scientists think about Dark Matter: they think that Dark Matter is ‘invisible’::: is ‘transparent’ Matter!

“The electron is a photon around Dark Matter”
Adrian Ferent

Stealing from Ferent Quantum Gravity about Dark Matter::: Black Holes…it is the way of the scientists. The huge majority of scientists are not capable to discover anything.

“Because Ferent Quantum Gravity is a new theory::: I did not use References”
Adrian Ferent

“Nobody understands Gravitation::: because nobody understands Dark Matter”
Adrian Ferent

“Dark Matter has another Structure::: based on Ferent length lF = 1.296 × 10^(-69) m much smaller than Planck length lP = 1.616199×10^(-3
5) m”
Adrian Ferent

Today all the Nobel Laureates::: the greatest scientists::: your professors… were not capable to explain Dark Matter::: they talk about Transparent matter because they can not see Dark Matter::: they talk about Baryonic matter::: Non-baryonic matter like axions::: they talk about cold::: warm or hot Dark Matte::: about Spersymmetric Particles as Dark Matter…but not beyond the Planck Wall.

“Quantum Mechanics can't explain Gravity because nobody understands Dark Matter”
Adrian Ferent

EHT picture of the Black Hole is wrong

“There is no Gravitational redshift around the Black Hole::: around the Event horizon of the Black Hole in Ferent Quantum Gravity::: like the red color in the EHT picture of the Black Hole”
Adrian Ferent

“Black Holes in Ferent Quantum Gravity have very small volume”
Adrian Ferent

French twins Igor and Grichka Bogdanov published in reputable scientific journals::: and were alleged by their authors to culminate in a proposed theory for describing what occurred at and before the Big Bang.

Igor and Grichka Bogdanov tried without success to explain what is beyond the Planck Wall.

“I am the first who discovered what is beyond the Planck Wall”
Adrian Ferent

Harvard has no students or professors that can produce the science and engineering to identify and track virus infections accurately. BLV may not even cause an Anti-body to produce::: sense its a bovine disease that likely just happens to have an active site in breast tissue it can inject DNA damaging material into::: thinking its going to be able to replicate::: instead leaving behind a potential cancer cell.

When sleep is stolen on a daily basis::: the risk is that sooner or later the health will pay too high a price and productivity will suffer.,"1) Study depended upon patient Self reporting. That is the definition of Bias. A better design could be developing Ai tech that is highly accurate at detecting when people enter deep sleep that is not intrusive. Like just sleep with cell phone nearby::: it will run an app to clock in and clock out automatically.
2) If someone has a medical problem::: or pain::: it could be much harder to sleep. You don't hear people say ""ohh my joints really hurts but I got great sleep last night"". If a preexisting condition existed at twice the rate for those that couldn't sleep::: it could be the preexisting conditions. (emotional distress::: pain pills::: etc..etc..)
3) Are there different kinds of dementia::: and is the diagnosis like depression? Depression is a symptom of a wide range of medical problems::: and it can cause from vitamin deficiency to being seasonal from lack of sunlight. Places like Harvard from poor methodology like in 1) made a symptom into a disease. Which is highly inappropriate and rather trashy. Dementia likely has an equally bad diagnostic decision tree. Had they used tech to get around patient self reporting::: and had raw data::: they could have had brain scans for a more detailed report on what kind of dementia.","Its a curious thing .
You could almost be forgiven for thinking that in order to retain memory and cognitive function as you get older ::: you would prefer peaceful and quiet surroundings::: in other words an almost boring environment::: so incredibly dull ::: that you could just take a nap :::like when ever and wherever .
This would suggest that in life you probably would not want to be particularly successful::: just averagely comfortable::: perhaps with a degree of moderate wealth.
It sort of sounds a bit like how Paul Volcker described his lower middle class upbringing: comfortable ::: but everyone had a few chores ::: like mowing the lawn and washing the dishes.
I would like to propose an experiment to test this theory ; students ought to be encouraged to snooze during classes and lectures ::: just to see if :
(a) they absorb knowledge subconsciously simply by hearing the lecture whilst sleeping ::: thus reducing the risk of ::: um ::: what was that disease called again ?
and :::
(b) sorry I dozed off ::: could you repeat the question please ?
(c) to see if I can remember my grans coleslaw recipe .",I’d suggest Matthew Walker’s “Why We Sleep” for anyone interested in the science and importance of sleep.,So PLese take care of them as your child.,"Are you going to do something about one of your professors intentionally lying::: and twisting history about Korean comfort women?

Since then you don't have to pick cotton or put on even one mask for indignant and self-centered strangers.
(2) In 1942 the cry was ""Japanese are dangerous let's remove them"" today the cry is ""citizens are asymptomatic let's mask them"" both deny each individual in the group due process of law because the problem::: if any::: has not been paired with each individual.
(3) It's defamation per-se to publicly state that an individual has covid (a loathsome disease) but that's what the gov't says with a mask mandate; in addition to coronavirus checks the gov't owes each individual damages for defamation.
(4) Your mask censors the facial expressions happiness::: sadness::: surprise and disgust so the mandate violates the First Amendment.

(5) The TV doctors such as Anthony Fauci and Leana Wen who have informed public policy choices across the country are not licensed to practice medicine in each of the states nor have they personally examined each individual in each state::: not even one patient history::: so there's no lawful predicate for ""universal masking.""
(6) Universal masking is an attempt to prevent ""community spread"" before it happens but protocols like the National Precrime Initiative described in the movie Minority Report (2002) have neither been fully debated nor enacted into law.

"Organic food is likely not safer::: better nutritionally::: or grown by a small::: local farm::: Robert Paarlberg argues in an excerpt from his new book.

NEWS.HARVARD.EDU
Author Robert Paarlberg argues against buying organic",2/6/21 14:10,This excerpt is full of false premise and strawman arguments::: pretending to get inside the heads of people who support organic::: sustainable::: agro ecology::: etc. Completely false in that these forms of agriculture have been and still are::: extensively researched. False in claiming the discussion of health is only about human health::: when it's more holistic concerns about biodiversity and soil health (and the devastating impacts of overuse of all kinds of fertilizers to our waterways.) False in claiming there's only one form of organic certification::: or that's the only way to obtain organic products. Lastly::: organic systems are studied in terms of food supply and security. Leaving everything up to a couple of biotech giants to patent and control is dangerous and infringes upon our freedom and sovereignty. Farmers grow conventional not because of cost::: but because of risk. They would switch in a heartbeat to get higher prices::: if only we would share the risk by supporting them in case of crop failures (which does still happen to conventional farmers.) If anything::: this book is going to push more of us to create an even bigger demand for sustainably produced food products.,Hmm. This article is largely about efficiency and cost in favor of Food::: Inc. There is no consideration of taste and well being. I’ve been fortunate enough to spend time these past several years in Tuscany. It’s true that anyone can feel like a great chef after cooking up almost anything from the local markets. It tastes so much better and comes seasonally in much greater variety. I chalk it up to an unswerving devotion by the populace that refuses to give it up.,"SMH if you are going to write an article about organic farming::: you should actually have experience in doing it. I’ve been organically farming for my family for years and I can tell you there is in fact a big difference in taste and mineral content when done correctly. Theres also a huge difference in the taste of meat and eggs of animals who are well cared for and grass fed. Our eggs are bright orange and taste delicious because our chickens get plants from our untreated property and kitchen scraps in addition to their feed. While he has a point with some of the commercial farming practices::: there are inconsistencies
in manure management and soil replenishment. There is a better way. A follow up article that covers farming practices that does produce delicious food::: less contamination and smarter farming practices would be more valuable info to share.",This must be written by someone who eats glyphosate latent foods and probably is stupid enough to own stock in such companies. Just goes to show that just because you went to Harvard or have a PHD doesn't make you smart. Rather::: it makes you conform to the System that created your thinking.,"To be or not to be organic::: that is the question. The balance leans towards flavor::: color::: texture::: aroma::: pesticide-free:::
traceability::: etc. Organic farming is more expensive::: but it has undeniable benefits.The nutritional value is identical.",This is not a strong argument and doesn't get the motives for buying or growing organic. I've been buying and sometimes growing organic food since the late 60's. -\-\Not strictly. Less harmful to self and planet. - better flavour.,Perhaps the push should be for adjustments to what is included in organic certification. It is surely better for our environment to stop the use of synthetic herbicides and insecticides. That::: to me::: is the reason purchasing organic makes sense - it is ‘safer’ for the environment. In centering the motivations on humans only::: I think Paarlberg misses the mark. Really feels like a hit piece paid for by big ag.,This article is vaguely exaggerated::: in favor of large scale conventional farmers and food inc.it’s so funny to see that organic farmers use more plastic compared to the conventional farmers::: on what basis? Many false claims has been made in order to green wash.Food need to be local::: Organic need to be the mainstream of future food.,I think that the bio food is the best food::: bio organic is natural::: no poison .,"“Consumers tend to favor organic food because they believe the advocates who claim it is safer and more nutritious to eat::: but there is little or no scientific evidence to support these claims.”

I disagree on the last clause of this statement. I kept reading the article looking for his specific examples of this contention::: but he did not connect the dots that he tried to align. Perhaps he intended to be more anecdotal::: but the price of that is an unconvincing article with a shocking subject line. I would be curious to see citations of studies proving that organic is not safer chemically speaking; I have read scientific studies on how crops soak up chemicals and retain them in systemic pesticide-spray
ed fields.",He is writing from an American perspective. How does American grown Organic compare with British grown Organic? What guidelines exist and how do they differ? Yes::: if it is more Labour intensive I expect to pay more. Similarly::: if there was little difference in production I would be upset at being conned.,In the past when ever I got forced into going to a farmers market by someone whom I might be dating::: I always felt that I was in a alternant reality because I would spend most of my time people watching rather than squeezing eggplants or sniffing onions. The customers and consumers always seem like people on a mission to another planet where truth and reality are tilted slightly in the direction of another Universe. On top of that I don't like to be jostled around by people with sacks who are in a mad dash for the perfect portobello mushroom! All 4 of my grandparents lived into their middle ninety's and if they had anything in common at all was the fact that they ate modest and balanced diets! Both my grandfathers never cooked a meal in their lives!,Organic is a defined expression and growing that way forbid certain substances. It does not explicitly say what to use. Local does not say its less polluted. growing organically next to a highway::: required few inch above a brownfield::: a dirty plant::: close proximity to conventionally grown fields (wind). I have not heard that the FDA randomly controls.,"Speaking only from personal experience::: I think maybe that growing your own peas and beans basil and parsley in a little polycarbonate green house::: with maybe a few comfrey plants to provide the raw liquid fertiliser ingredients::: is a reasonably decent value investment; you get some nice produce for the kitchen ::: for a small outlay . There are companion plant flowers which are supposed to repel pests and some bird life will chase caterpillars and so on ::: but the reality is most of our food requires tractors ::: artificial fertiliser and pesticides and herbicides.
But a bit of produce from both schools of thought will probably always be the method by which dinner arrives.","Hummm.... the law of supply and demand::: farm subsidies for “traditional” crops::: and the nonchalant take on the impact of pesticides in the environment and to humans? “Pillage and plunder the earth::: it’s fine!”

I don’t need to read the whole article to know the answers. You can pay now or you can pay later with illness and the need for healthcare. You are what you eat. As a farmer::: I’ll keep providing high-quality foods that are nutrient dense to my local community that are free of pesticides.",To be honest::: I feel a little strange about organic material's food. Doesn't mean that i want to degrade The organic food::: but honestly that something that i tasted of,Harvard wants us to eat chemical laced food and help companies grow at the cost of our health...as simple as that ..,OMFG what silly talk this thing's for like srsly you're kidding out because I don't find anything bad about the organic food since when I was a child 'till now as a lass.,Natural foods are ALWAYS healthy.,Good day Everyone::: I'm 19 years old I was interested to know if I could study online at Harvard University? I'm from South Africa,organic food::: without chemicals.,Good bye Harvard page. I'm flagging you,We need a different term for what you're talking about - all food is organic - it's not healthy at all to eat inorganic matter,The summer we grew almost all our vegetables (no pesticides or fertilizers) my husband's eczema completely cleared up. Now we buy direct from a local organic farm::: AT the farm. We see the vegetables before they are picked. No fraud whatsoever.,This is fake information. Because Harvard isn't a place to deal with true learning.,"Am I surprised? No. Besides::: ""organic"" doesn't mean what the propagandists say it does.",Political scientist not an actual biochemical::: nutritional::: health::: or even agricultural scientist. Tells you all you need to know about his credibility. 🙄,They even taste different.,The author makes many many claims but with no citations to back any of it up,I think it is sad that there is not yet a market or incentive to start our own farming locally or independently.,Marx alluded to the rural sector being subservient to the urban working class so it stands that some would not want the farmer to make more than the city folks especially the small::: local farmer. Corporate farms would be ok since the headquarters would be in the city and/or China.,Isn’t it true though that organic foods can not be genetically modified?,"Oh goodness::: yes::: call me cynical but I’m far more likely to trust a cow to produce/
manufacture manure/
fertilizer that is safe over a corporation. Case and point being companies like Monsanto. Give me cow poop over there “scientific” corporation produced stuff any day 😉 lol",With both processes human have enough to feed on...

CAPITALISM SHOULD BE ON SOCIETY'S TERMS

Many in society have been taught to believe that the public has no right to tell corporations what to do with their money any more than a private citizen has the right to tell his neighbor what to do with the money he earns from a business or store. This is not a fair analogy.

True enough that a private citizen doesn’t have the right to tell his neighbor what to do with his money but the public does have the right to tell corporations what to do with their money. Why? Because corporations couldn’t exist without very special and unique government help. Corporations are special legal entities that have unique rights::: privileges::: and protections given by government that ordinary citizens and business owners do not have. And::: since the government in a democracy like ours comes from the people (the majority in society) and it's the people's government that gave corporations their unique rights and privileges::: the people have the right to determine how corporations act and how they spend their money. The majority in a democracy own the franchise of government!

Therefore::: the public has a right to demand something from corporations in exchange for giving corporations the right to exist. Would I not have the right::: even as a private citizen::: to demand something from a business built on my property? The same logic applies to the relationship between the public (society) and corporations. Corporations cannot hide behind the specious argument of rugged individualism!

Many in our society have been brainwashed to believe that an absolutely free marketplace with no government controls or regulations would automatically fix our nation’s problems. Have we forgotten already that the Great Depression of the early 1930s was the direct result of a free market economy with no government control or regulation? The 2008 market crash was because of lack of enough government regulation in capitalism::: and if government hadn't intervened to rescue the banks capitalism would have ended in our country and we would have all starved to death. That's right!

Rugged individualism teaches that the individual has the right to benefit from social and economic interactions with society::: but that society has no right to demand any benefit from the individual.

No one has absolute individual rights in society. Those who want absolute individual rights must live outside of society. Those who want to be part of society with the benefits of government and law must be willing to grant what the majority want::: even if it’s at their own expense.

Yes::: minorities have rights::: but the majority has more rights. Absolute individualism is absolutely unfair. The majority has the right to tax an individual and collect money to build a park even if that individual doesn’t want the park and will never use the park. The majority has a right to tax an individual and use the money to provide welfare or help to those who genuinely can’t help themselves in society.

Self-proclaimed
rugged individualists in society want all the benefits of what the majority has to provide - government::: law::: security::: and protection - but they do not want give up anything to the majority in exchange for these benefits. These so-called rugged individualists are the real leeches and parasites of society.

The fact is there are no real rugged individualists in society!

If capitalism and social consciousness cannot coexist::: then how is it that modern industrialized nations such as Canada::: Sweden::: Norway::: Denmark::: and others can have a high degree of social consciousness and still be capitalistic with a thriving free enterprise?

The rich are not paying their fair share of the taxes. Even billionaire Warren Buffet has said that his office secretary pays more in taxes in proportion to her income than he does.

The wealthy and corporations in our country have socked away trillions of dollars (yes::: trillions of dollars) overseas so that their money cannot be taxed. If our government could tax that money::: at a fair and reasonable rate::: we would have enough money in this country to pay for all public services without having to tax the middle class more. We could do a lot for our nation and people.

Strategic taxes on corporations alone would provide plenty of money to provide a safety net for Americans. These corporations won't go broke but can still thrive and grow. They do it in Sweden::: Denmark::: Norway::: Germany::: Canada. They can do it here in the U.S.A.!

The far right wants no controls and regulations on the economy::: and that's what got us in the economic mess in 2008. Without legitimate controls and regulations in the financial markets::: the greedy in our financial world were able to amass huge fortunes through dishonesty and would have totally destroyed all our lives if not for government intervention into the banking and economic system.

Corporations receive special legal status and tax benefits from the government::: which private business owners do not have::: and the government comes from the people (society). So::: corporations do have a duty to the general society and not just to their shareholders. Government should tax corporations to help society as modern and advanced European nations do (i.e. Sweden::: Norway::: Germany).

People can still become wealthy in a socialist society but not at the detrimental expense of others in society. Many of the basic rights::: especially regarding safety in the work place::: that we take for granted were not graciously given to society by the rich but won by the blood of bludgeoned workers and strikers in the early 20th century.

THE CELL could not have evolved. A partially evolved cell would quickly disintegrate under the effects of random forces of the environment::: especially without the protection of a complete and fully functioning cell membrane. A partially evolved cell cannot wait millions of years for chance to make it complete and living! In fact::: it couldn't have even reached the partially evolved state.

CATCH-22 FOR EVOLUTIONARY ORIGIN OF LIFE

Just having the right materials::: elements::: and conditions do not mean that life can arise by chance.

Miller::: in his famous experiment in 1953 showed that individual amino acids (the building blocks of life) could come into existence by chance. But::: it's not enough just to have amino acids. The various amino acids that make-up life must link together in a precise sequence::: just like the letters in a sentence::: to form functioning protein molecules. If they're not in the right sequence the protein molecules won't work. It has never been shown that various amino acids can bind together into a sequence by chance to form protein molecules. Even the simplest cell is made up of many millions of various protein molecules.

What many don't realize is that although oxygen is necessary for life's processes::: the presence of oxygen would prevent life from coming into being. This is because oxygen is destructive unless there are mechanisms already in place to control::: direct::: and regulate it::: such as what we find in already existing forms of life.

RNA and DNA are made up of molecules (nucleic acids) that must also exist in the right sequence. Furthermore::: none of these sequential molecules::: proteins::: DNA::: RNA::: can function outside of a complete and living cell and all are mutually dependent on one another. One cannot come into existence without the other.

Mathematicians have said any event in the universe with odds of 10 to 50th power or greater is impossible! The probability of just a single average size protein molecule arising by chance is 10 to the 65th power. The late great British scientist Sir Frederick Hoyle calculated that the odds of even the simplest cell coming into existence by chance is 10 to the 40:::000th power! How large is this? Consider that the total number of atoms in our universe is 10 to the 82nd power.

The cell could not have evolved. A partially evolved cell would quickly disintegrate under the effects of random forces of the environment::: especially without the protection of a complete and fully functioning cell membrane. A partially evolved cell cannot wait millions of years for chance to make it complete and living! In fact::: it couldn't have even reached the partially evolved state.

Alien beings::: even if they do exist::: could not have evolved. How could they have survived millions of years while the very biological structures::: organs::: and systems necessary for their survival were supposedly still evolving? Life::: in any form (even a single-celled organism)::: must be complete::: fully integrated::: and fully-functioni
ng from the very start to be fit for survival.

Of course::: once there is a complete and living cell then the code and mechanisms exist to direct the formation of more cells. The problem for evolutionists is how did the cell originate when there were no directing code and mechanisms in nature. Natural laws may explain how a cell or airplane works but mere undirected natural laws could not have brought about the existence of either.

What about synthetic life? Scientists didn’t create life itself. What they've done is::: by using intelligent design and sophisticated technology::: scientists built DNA code from scratch and then they implanted that man-made DNA into an already existing living cell and alter that cell. That's what synthetic life is.

Through genetic engineering scientists have been able to produce new forms of life by altering already existing forms of life::: but they have never created life from non-living matter. Even if they do::: it won’t be by chance but by intelligent design. That doesn’t help the theory of evolution.

What about natural selection? Natural selection doesn't create or produce anything. It can only ""select"" from biological variations that are possible and which have survival value. If a variation occurs that helps a species survive::: that survival is called "" natural selection."" It's a passive process. There's no conscious selection by nature::: and natural selection only operates in nature once there is life and reproduction and not before::: so it would not be of assistance to the origin of life.

Science can't prove we're here by chance or design. Neither was observed. Both are positions of faith. The issue is which faith is best supported by science. Let the scientific arguments of both sides be presented.

If something is posted in the public domain::: be aware of the confirmation bias. I disagree that her speech was remarkable but rather dull::: does not mean that you should remove my post! As you know::: for something to be outstanding you have to give importance to those that say it’s unremarkable::: as only by those who agree it’s bland::: something can be seen as remarkable.

I.e. you cannot have beauty without knowing the ugly!

In my opinion::: this lady does not represent African::: but she represents contemporary American. Her speech was not impressive::: but loads of cliches and language used to make it sound unique.

How to talk to your kids about the Capitol riots",1/15/21 15:46,"""You see son::: when an unaccountable government hates their people very much::: and the people get together with the government::: the government has the police start riots to avoid accountability.
..""",I think it's important to reflect on the events of the past seven months. Violence (rioting) in any manner is an inappropriate response. One cannot have two sets of standards and expect to resolve any issue. Disagreement is normal and healthy to any relationship and must not be suppressed.,Your school has always been worthless and idiotic. You will have so many law suits against you. All democrats will be placed on the do not hire list after this crap they are trying and not even going to succeed to pull,It'd be nice if people would actually read the article before criticizing the entire Harvard institution for promoting X views... Kind of what the article is talking about - discussing feelings and perspectives and understanding from where they stem...,"It was pretty much a bland and vacant discussion on how to assist a child by the concerns events may have impacted them. Aside from the obvious misrepresentati
on of our “democracy”::: of which it too may have been an attempt to remain seemingly aloof or detached. Until the cover granted for BLM and their violence. Granted::: Boston is easily the most racist city I have ever lived in which may have clouded his judgment. And granted no rational thinker wishes to give racist tendencies any credence that may lead to some sort of justification. But his biases counter reality and I often question if such positions of hypocrisy are an element of virtue signaling or self loathing from latent personal predilections. I hope it simply wasn’t well thought out. An opportunity missed.","😂What is wrong with you?! Leave the kids out of adult problems!

Only incompetent parents put stress on their kids regarding world problems.

Show them unconditional love::: promote education::: discipline::: and accepting everyone is different.

You want unstable kids? Tell them problems most adults don’t understand that are full of bias and misinformation.

No surprise a “psychologist” wrote the article!🙄 Trying to build future business!😉","Dear Kids:::
Do yourselves a huge favor and stay away from Harvard. There are nursery schools that have better degrees!! When the the FBI tells speaker Pelosi that there is going to be some sort of problem at the Capital and she and Shummer act like their prayers are answered and they tell everyone to stand down. You have a government of people who think they are Gods. If anyone is guilty of any of the deaths it is them. They are the ones who have blood on their hands. They conspired to comment tierny they should be behind bars ASAP ...",Just pour them a big glass of Kool-Aid and send them to a safe room. SNOWFLAKES,#NAME?,"""...we have lost a shared reality.

Y’all need to be in jai::: and watch out! If we have our way::: you will be!,Democrat protests for SCOTUS hearing was more harmful and they even encouraged it. HARVARD is a woke leftist’s school boasting of color diversity as long as there is only one viewpoint - the left.

Why anyone would pay money to even stop on the campus is beyond me. When you start letting a bunch of whiny cry babies run the store nothing good can happen. Maybe instead you should teach the children on your campus that they don't get to control how other people think and feel. You might also pass around the definition of ""insurrection"" - because what happened on the 6th was not an insurrection.","I explain to my grandchildren that progressives::: and most especially the progressives at Harvard::: are hateful::: mean vindictive people.

20 Years ago I began research on the critical Socratic Dialectical Inquiry—""How did Legality and Morality get separated in America? Eventually answering this question became a 5-Volume collection of books titled-\-\""THE PROGRESSIVE REVOLUTION: History of Liberal Fascism through the Ages.""
In the Prologue section of those books I cited ""Year 1871"" as Year One when Liberal Fascism became fully operational in America and the original 1787 Constitution founded under Natural Law::: Natural Rights::: and the Original Intent of the Constitutional Framers became a deadletter. . . Until the Apotheosis of PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP (2017 - Present) who recently resurrected our sacred REPUBLIC conceived on July 4::: 1776 = United States for America🥰🥳🙏
What does that mean for U.S. in Year 2021? “Since 1871 the United States president and the United States Congress has been playing politics under a different set of rules and policies. The American people do not know that there are two Constitutions in the United States. The first penned by the leaders of the newly independent states of the United States in 1776. On July 4::: 1776::: the people claimed their independence from Britain and Democracy was born. And for 95 years the United States people were free and independent. That freedom ended in 1871 when the original “Constitution for the united states for America” was changed to the “THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA”.

Our government seems to be apathetic and all talk to the needs of the American people in their promises.

Any bill associated with giving money to the American people in the way of a stimulus check should be a bill only for giving the American people money as a stimulus check without congress attaching other monetary interests to the bill. This way there are no excuse by congress as to why it did not pass.

They climbed the Capitol and replaced the American Flag with a Trump flag. 😢😥😓,I didn't expect such from the people of America and this event calls for continuous orientation of the public on political matters using both formal and informal approach.,"The difference in police presence between the Washington Black Lives Matter demonstrations:::
and that of the white Trumpers yesterday::: is absolutely appalling. The resignation of those responsible should be demanded today.",Shameful riots::: looting and violence all summer praised by media and the left? FBI is doing an amazing job uncovering the planned event which nothing to do with the peaceful protest. Security video showing protestors let in like tourists raises questions - how deep does it go?,So sick of the bs from “higher education “. Sounds like Nazi Germany,I guess everybody calling to revoke degrees::: doesn’t remember when the Democrats challenged the EC vote in 2016 or when Pelosi did it when Bush won...hmmm revoke their degrees too?!,It is embarrassing for Harvard that Trump’s propaganda arm Kayleigh McEnany and Seditionist Ted Cruz are grads .,"You sit around and try to think up what other vile hate acts that you can perpetuate on those who don’t think like you do and call yourselves superior. That’s what Hitlers regime did. You’re no different in your attacks on innocent people. Disgraceful.

1) Harvard should refund money back spent for degrees.
2) This proves just how worthless a Harvard Degree is worth.",It’s definitely a double standard but putting politicians in jeopardy is a serious offense.,Really it is not understanding all of this why they would react like this or the result is done,"""Our election was hijacked.

80...",Most Americans support President Trump and will not tolerate a second rate university like Harvard to say derogatory things about him. Any professor who speaks evil about President Trump should be fired.,I would ask Harvard to be fair across the board and anyone who pushed the Russia Scandal that was based without any evidence or made up evidence as they cited with Ms. Stefanik should also be removed from the board.,Reminds me of the end of a WCW show in the late 90s when the NWO would rush the stage. It was entertaining. Its not their problem how people choose to react.,"What happened in Congress is a shame on the United States of America and I proposed to the Senate and the House of Representatives
to enact a new law that would make the current president and his administrations
complicit in the crime that took place. in the Capitol house ::: and they would be deprived of any government or administrative or political position for life::: US national security is a red line.",The event was truly horrendous::: even considering that it is only the first week of 2021. 😔,"Shame on you pieces of sh*t criminals. You have a 42 BILLION dollar endowment and laying off subs who have been keeping the university clean for 20+ years is some how a menace to 1% of that endowment?

Here is how the money is used according to CNBC :

Twenty-four percent of endowment spending is used for professorships:::
19% is used on scholarships and student support::: 7% is used on research costs::: 4% goes toward the school's libraries and museums::: 2% goes toward faculty and teaching::: 1% is used for construction and 9% is used for “other” costs.

Shame on the leadership.
You have failed as an institution on this disturbing and misguided decision. Particularly given what we are living through as a society::: knowing very well this pandemic has hit minorities particularly hard.

Ask MGH Boston doctors and staff who are the ones showing up day in day out to make sure all surfaces as desinfencted during the peak of the pandemic. Ask MBTA and other essential services who were out there keeping the lights on?

SHAME ON YOU !",So sad I don't like this is the shamful indeed it's the best education center,Sad. Shocked. Listened to Colin Power Speaking on the Television Today.,Harvard= breeding socialist on other people’s money!,The Democratic party is the enemy of the people folks and no I did not go to Harvard I went to Oxford University::: Oxford::: England.,You people are so intolerant and nothing but a bunch of bullies! Knock it off!,I couldn’t even open this! The opinions of agents of the insurrection. And the conditioned minions. They hold no volition.,BLM & ANTIFA DID THIS YOU JERKOFFS,Is your degree worth the piece of paper it is wrote on!

"""Humans have these deep-rooted instincts to avoid unnecessary physical activity::: because until recently it was beneficial to avoid it."" - Professor Lieberman

NEWS.HARVARD.EDU
Daniel Lieberman busts exercising myths",1/4/21 22:45,"I think that after eating hypothetical fire-crackers for a decade::: either the overwhelming stress did help me evolve; or I am just smart enough to remotely know the consequences of laze. I do get lazy::: (and very comfortable in bed) and try to perfect things like my posture... but I know in my heart of hearts that the sidewalk::: the park::: or the iron staircase that I meander to 18 times a day brings me the most joy. I am a pleasure seeker.

I did reflect upon one-third of the review because that’s all I read!🏃🏽",I think that we all are so lazy to do physical activities otherwise I up till now see some people jogging and not use cars or taxis.,I just saw tv show that said Yale let in a undocumented mexican::: a mexican female::: first mexico is supposed to stop illgeal immigrants::: second her moneys no good she is a mexican female::: money all has a English male (all us value was from English males from steam engine to space::: no female any ethnicity will repay the labor it takes to construction the usa out of debt). John Harvard would be disgusted you didn't let into Harvard. My family dates to the origin of the English language::: a knighthood and a grade 1 listed building::: skyscraper and aerospace work. Fischer family line surname has four Nobel prizes::: a Olympic skii company and other scientific contributions. You're school should be shut down and ivy league status revoked. You are devry.,Nice ..Take care of your body. This is the only place you can live..,I have some knowledge,The way no to be a couch potato,Harvard::: love to see this university,This review is very interesting...,Good ❤️👍,Stone Age people were probably dead by 65,Hurrem Mustafa,"https://

WHILE WAITING FOR a proper vaccine::: make sure that you have adequate levels of Vitamins B::: C::: D and the mineral zinc. These nutrients greatly support the immune system and can help prevent an illness from becoming serious and even prevent death from the Covid-19 virus::: as well as other viruses. Do some research::: please.

Even when you get a vaccine::: it’s your immune system that must fight the virus. A proper vaccine jump-starts your immune system in detecting and fighting the virus. A vaccine gives your immune system a head-start to battle the virus.

Interestingly::: they have found that zinc slows down the activity of the virus and this enables your body's immune system to catch-up in fighting the virus.

It takes only pennies a day of supplements to prevent terrible and easily avoidable tragedy.",Clya Mitztoo,❣️❣️,Luz Y Evolucion,Like,"Coin 12 million people are mining. Publicly founded team::: entrusted by Nicolas from stan ford university research

WHILE WAITING FOR a proper vaccine::: make sure that you have adequate levels of Vitamins B::: C::: D and the mineral zinc. These nutrients greatly support the immune system and can help prevent an illness from becoming serious and even prevent death from the Covid-19 virus::: as well as other viruses. Do some research::: please.

Even when you get a vaccine::: it’s your immune system that must fight the virus. A proper vaccine jump-starts your immune system in detecting and fighting the virus. A vaccine gives your immune system a head-start to battle the virus.

Interestingly::: they have found that zinc slows down the activity of the virus and this enables your body's immune system to catch-up in fighting the virus.

This city::: then that city::: then the next one. Very simple on how to supply. US::: its first responders and elderly first::: which adds a lot of complication. England's method maybe holistically better. Alternatives is transportation hub focused. Like people making flights::: or international flights. Get a plane ticket::: get a vaccine. Had they did this before thanksgiving there might not have been that huge spike coming up in 2 weeks. If there an oversupply to airport::: then first responders. You don't save a first responder by condemning their family to an ineffective strategy. If hitting the airport first helps prevent the spread to new areas. This is what simulators are for::: so one can produce a measurement on different strategies. Maybe the measurements not really reflective of reality::: then the measurement sucks::: but if the simulator approximates reality well::: then the measurement would be of value for trying different strategies.,"Manufacturers & clinicians are not liable for COVID-19 Vaccine injury or death::: under PREP act of Countermeasures

Even when you get a vaccine::: it’s your immune system that must fight the virus. A proper vaccine jump-starts your immune system in detecting and fighting the virus. A vaccine gives your immune system a head-start to battle the virus.

Interestingly::: they have found that zinc slows down the activity of the virus and this enables your body's immune system to catch-up in fighting the virus.

a Spirit of wisdom and of understanding:::
A Spirit of counsel and of strength:::
a Spirit of knowledge and of fear of the LORD:::
and his delight shall be the fear of the LORD.
Not by appearance shall he judge:::
nor by hearsay shall he decide:::
But he shall judge the poor with justice:::
and decide aright for the land’s afflicted.
He shall strike the ruthless with the rod of his mouth:::
and with the breath of his lips he shall slay the wicked.
Justice shall be the band around his waist:::
and faithfulness a belt upon his hips.
Then the wolf shall be a guest of the lamb:::
and the leopard shall lie down with the kid;
The calf and the young lion shall browse together:::
with a little child to guide them.
The cow and the bear shall be neighbors:::
together their young shall rest;
the lion shall eat hay like the ox.
The baby shall play by the cobra’s den:::
and the child lay his hand on the adder’s lair.
There shall be no harm or ruin on all my holy mountain;
for the earth shall be filled with knowledge of the LORD:::
as water covers the sea.
On that day:::
The root of Jesse:::
set up as a signal for the nations:::
The Gentiles shall seek out:::

Today when they climb into the rocket the astronauts climb on their feet.

When they get off the rocket after 6 months on International Space Station::: 2 strong men carry them in their arms::: so Ferent is right.

If Einstein were right::: astronauts would have to be younger after 6 months in space and jump around the rocket.

During Fulbright interview::: I took written test in which I was supposed write an essay whose topic was heinous. IF YOU ARE PERVAIZE MUSHARAF WHAT WOULD YOU DO AFTER RETIREMENT was the topic. Pervaize Musharraf was president of Pakistan who captured a government through coup and bore the blames of causing the murders of several political leaders. It was all against my inclination as I had been sensitive curious person who had been interested in philosophy of Physics. Earlier than that my German language study too was being used to snatch my curiosity to learn.later my student visas were refused and even visa of Germany despite my learning German in pakistan. Here everything belongs to regimented institutions which obstruct the development of curious people who are interested to learn sciences and Arts.,"""Staying positive"" is probably a not really thought through wording these days. 😂",Staying safe & healthy,Stay healthy:::stay happy.💪,happy thanksgiving,which one university is best for political science programe ?? please help or guide!,Stay,Harvard=Dream,🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸💙💋🙏,😊👍,Chul Jong Yung,"Try audible premium plus and get up to two free audiobooks

"From divisiveness to diversity to disinformation::: Harvard scholars discuss the 2020 election.

NEWS.HARVARD.EDU
Scholars and analysts reflect on lessons learned",11/6/20 20:15,"#JohnAdams The 2nd President of the United States was John Adams. He was accepted at Harvard and was only 15 years old [1751-1755].
'We should be unfaithful to ourselves if we should ever lose sight of the danger to our liberties if anything partial or extraneous should infect the purity of our free::: fair::: virtuous::: and independent elections.'
John Adams::: Inaugural Address::: March 4::: 1797",This school is garbage!,"Harvard University faculty analyzing the elections is to be appreciated. Divisiveness and Diversity Indians can easily understand as India abounds in these two parameters. It is common for minor groups to swing the election result. The analysis has not been done and /or not published from a different angle. That is::: in terms of numbers and percentages of various target/
ethnic groups. According to –not so old statistics –nearly 73% of USA population are whites. So whites constitute the vast majority. However::: of the whites approximately 61% are Non-Hispanic whites. So Hispanic whites are only 12 % . So minimum 27 % are Non-whites and if Hispanic whites are included here then 27 + 12=39%. Even then whites are a majority . But two parties are there . That is where the crucial discussion crops up. So who is swinging the result ? The 27% or 39 % or both or a majority mixture of both ? . Harvard university analysis say that “overwhelming majority of African-Americans::: Latinos and Asians have voted for democrats ..” ( according to one BBC news site many Latinos voted for Republicans) . I do not know how people view this fact reported. Sixty seven percent (67%) of eligible voters have cast their vote equivalent to 160 million people . ( How this 160 million has to be further divided into the above mentioned groups) . One can say that one third of the eligible voters have abstained from voting ! Being an advanced country::: educated and being an important election one would not expect so much of absenteeism from voting. But what is really shocking is people abstaining from voting is common even in USA !! It is really surprising that 67% this time is the highest turn out during the last hundred years !! So a pertinent question is::: who among the above mentioned target groups usually refrain from voting ? Who during the past and who this time ? The same target groups ?? Very likely the absenteeism from voting- both in the past and this time-\-\ is more among whites than in Non-whites. For future also one can make calculations. Presuming that even all whites are equally divided between the two parties –36.5 % each the remaining target groups -27%- can always influence the outcome. So to counteract the 27 % Non-whites::: proportionally whites have to vote if they want to decide which party to win ! As long as white’s votes are equally divided or even more or less equally divided between the two parties ::: it is the 27 % Non-whites who will be deciding the election result.",There is no democrasy even in US! Maybe we should start to avoid term democrasy at all atleast in sence defiened before,I voted for Mr. Harding. He promised to restore normalcy after the Great War.,"Many of us would be delighted to give generously to Harvard -\-\ the day the University makes a public commitment and plan to divest from fossil fuels::: and redirect investment to sustainable energy investments. Harvard could boldly lead the world in this direction: the only route to survival for the planet as we know it.
There is every reason for the world's leading seat of learning to assume this leadership role at once. By not doing so::: Harvard signals to the finance sector that it's acceptable to profit from carbon emissions. Harvard can break this suicide pact with big oil.",I used to say that Republicans are Americans::: Democrats are humans.,Some news agencies always carries narrow insights::: rather than broad insights of circulating news?,"https://

Her interview on FoxNews where even the Fox hosts were trying to get her to grasp that ballots mailed and postmarked before the election in PA and other states are legal ballots whether they arrive at polls on 11/3 or a couple days later.....she just could not grasp the concept.

NEWS.HARVARD.EDU
Harvard analysts react to the 2020 election",11/5/20 14:30,I highly appreciated Harvard’s experts predicting Biden’s landslide victory yesterday. Impressive to see such accuracy. I would most certainly not be so foolish as to disregard their expert opinion on anything::: seeing as they so obviously know what they’re doing.,I think he is fine legally. He has laid a convincing case for not guilty of anything by reason of mental disease or defect. Likely both in this case.,Interesting::: the analysts have more emotional temper over Trump personality and assumed many of his evil intentions. This is not an independent analysis to be honest. The article only mentioned Trump's legal challenges but failed to mention the potential election fraud::: which could be true or not::: but worth an investigation. Unfortunately::: the author made his own judgment implying that all Trump legal challenges are not true at writing the analysis. This extreme biased article on Harvard publication is a shame to the school.,"Seems premature to provide an ""expert opinion"" on a situation in which all the facts have not been gathered.",Now we don't need any experts opinions.,"“I think one part of it is as a Hail Mary and the other part of it is to create a basis for claiming the outcome is not politically legitimate.”
— Alex Keyssar::: Harvard Kennedy School",It's stunning to see how people prefer spending billions of taxpayers money to recount the votes (which has never overthrown any election) because of fear of going to prison (and a fragile ego) rather than have them invested to help the economy.,Sometimes when I read some of the crazy responses on Harvard posts::: I think... Well that person obviously didn't go to Harvard. 🤣,As long as they are illogical and shallow :::he will just come out of court room with nothing,"Still. More opposition Harvard.

VIRUSES ARE ""offshoots"" of life::: and::: literally::: trillions of years wouldn't be enough time for the sequence of molecules in the “simple” DNA/RNA of a virus to come into existence by chance. In fact::: DNA cannot come into existence without RNA and proteins. All three are mutually dependent. One cannot come into existence without the other two. The fact that some viruses have only DNA while others only have RNA is evidence that they are offshoots of living organisms::: which have both. A virus depends on a living organism to replicate::: further evidence that viruses are offshoots of living organisms::: not their precursors.

"Do justices really set aside personal beliefs? A Harvard legal scholar says they do not.

NEWS.HARVARD.EDU
Legal Scholar warns of potential Supreme Court changes",10/16/20 15:45,Any time can give some lesson's,non-bias legal scholar womp womp,"And I will restore your judges as at the first::: and your counselors as at the beginning. Afterward you shall be called the city of righteousness::: the faithful city.”

Isaiah 1:26",I was watching this and thinking is not all law derived from the grapevine of the the Church hence my findings that all good lawyers know that the laws of the Bible steamed so deeply which still has relevance today to bring law and order the past still has relevance today in the consequences foretold for the law of today.,I want to study Kindergarten I mentor this university degree ole,"personal belief is private...belie
f is public",Whats the difference between a belief and a personal belief ?,Hae Guys How Is Education?,If she 2ill be confirmed::: the SCOTUS to be really conservative.,I doubt Those who accuse her of inability to abandon personal beliefs can do the same. Jesus hates those hypocrites who tell the people to do the demands they can’t do by themselves.,It is not surprising people can be biased. Who knew. In the constitution lies the rabbit hole. The constitution was never based on any modern understanding of human behavior or cognition,A lifetime promise is only a promise. If the court continues to avoid important issues and to support what is clearly not he wish of the people::: that court is putting itself in jeopardy. Do not discount the will of the people::: particularly in matters that the people suffer from. The Supremes aren't gods::: regardless of the misguided view people share about them.,Why don’t you admit you hate trump when you write garbage like this,"Albert Einstein once said: ""Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity."" But what is much more widespread than the actual stupidity is the playing stupid::: turning off your ear::: not listening::: not seeing.",Of course they do not! They are humans! Even doctors have to be really disciplined at times to stick to the oath. Would be desirable that lawyers too get the training to be well equipped for handling their own biases and preferences and beliefs professionally.,Would the same not apply to Klarman? Maybe machines should decide for us,Kagan certainly didn't.,They do not::: as well normally under Democracy unrest::: Justices might be influenced by Powerful Political Interests. No doubt *,"""Elections have consequences.""
-Barack Obama
And cmon::: this guy clerked for RBG. Should we expect bias on this issue::: ahh yeah.",The left has their tail between their legs since ACB surfaced. Trump also had a great performance last night on Town Hall. Looks like there's going to be a red wave on November 3rd.,If they can't set aside their personal beliefs::: they shouldn't be there. The U.S. made a terrible mistake::: when they started appointing Supreme Court justices for life. In the final analysis::: they're nothing more than lawyers. A ten-year term makes far more sense. They could still be consulted after leaving the bench.,I am taking about my innovation and intellectual property already 14 years or so. I sent emails to Supreme Court. I think they are corrupt::: listening some stories and ignoring what is right. The world is exploring my system and network. Supreme Court has no time to make that right. I think they should do their job. I do not really believe they are competent or considered.,..didn’t think they did::: or would.,Left justices are better ...lol. How stupid is that,"This is woman who really has not lived in the real world - she's been cloistered in her religious ""community"" and academic surroundings. How would she know what it's like to experience job discrimination:::
treatment as a second class citizen or woman who was being forced to carry a pregnancy to term when a simple D & C could end a mistake. What a travesty that Justice Ginsburg will be replaced by an ideologue - our Supreme Court will never be the same again when it comes to woman's rights.",Lawyers are typically really bad at math. To remove bias requires numeral data collected in a very raw physics like way. Lot of academics collect data::: but typically in bad fields labels based on human opinion so they force the data to fit a biased perspective. Raw unbiased data is typical in the fields these days that are making the most breakthroughs::: and often challenging almost all of the 20th century science not confirming it. Lawyers::: there no hope for them to understand it takes an extremely long time to remove bias. So what the Legal Scholar said is true of everyone.,Me too. I second that. Take the people v. Peyote for example..,This guy is a scholar? Rubbish from a leftist!,"Someone needs to explain to this so-called ""scholar"" what court packing is::: here's a hint: the Republicans aren't or haven't been doing it. Also it's not the job of the Dems to 'control' SCOTUS::: it's supposed to be independent from other parts of the government.","At the macro level::: I have a feeling that she is going to overturn Roe v. Wade but not ACA.

Yet the question is: will the Dems expand the court right away (in case Biden makes it) or wait until something is overturned (to be like a publicly-motiva
ted move)?","Every Living Human Being has some forms of believes either subjective or objective in the application of the believes.

Under the “rules of law and order” the application of believes is selectively restrained since the conscience is WATCHED by the Constitution::: Laws::: Rules and applicable Statutory Provisions already put in place.

Therefore having believe alone is conditionally insufficient to disqualify a Candidate nominated and confirmed to filled Supreme Court Justice Vacancy.","Just because this person cannot put aside his personal beliefs in order to do his job does not mean that no one can.
I taught at university and I put aside my personal feelings every single day. I liked some students and I disliked some students. I have personal beliefs and they have persona;l beliefs. But when it came time for me to make decisions I made them based on objective criteria. Now do not tell me that a judge will not or cannot do the same when it is something of such importance.
Almost every single person who has a job must put aside their personal preferences-\-\in
cluding their SEXUAL PREFERENCES-\-\in
order to do their work. If no one could put aside their personal beliefs::: almost no work could be done anywhere!
What tripe.",Supreme Court Judges should be voted on by the populace. People in positions of power should not be able to appoint judges as that in itself leads to corruption.,If justices aren’t allowed to have personal believes::: let’s just put robots in there. 😂,"The Senate gives every state two seats. The House seats are based on population. This system prevents the majority city populous from running over the less populous states! Get out of your bubble! Stop trying to make America::: majority rule! We are not and I pray never become ruled by the popular vote. Minorities would be underrepresente
d is every aspect of government::: whether it be race::: creed::: religious::: or political slant.","The writer is fearful that we will return to principles and beliefs once respected in a democratic society. Values like personal responsibility:::
owning one’s life choices and their consequences::: acquiring skills needed for a living wage/ benefits job and continued success::: personal initiative::: and the ability to think critically. Most of these values have been educated OUT of a whole generation. Which is why the esteemed writer has to ask a question that common sense answers easily.",Garbage article. History is filled with justices that are religious and carry certain personal beliefs.,originalists at least try::: the activist justices don't even.,I’m really confused ...so if this is true ... then there 8 others justices who then “cannot set aside personal beliefs “ ... why is this one now sudden a “problem “???,Of course they don’t. Our beliefs are a part of us. We can only attempt to be unbiased.,I want to go back to the days when the senate acted as adults and confirmed presidential nominees who were qualified. RBG was confirmed by a 96-3 vote. Imagine that.,Nope they don’t.,If everything is ordaining by god shouldn't they put him before the court? Law is based on rational thought and not fantasy. Now the fanatics want law based on hocus pocus...I don't want a world that doesn't listen to women.,"Starting from the premise that a liberal supreme Court is what we need is ludicrous. Plus the author has no command of the English language and uses ""whom"" inappropriately
several times showing his ignorance.",Would y'all be saying the same things if the justice was a practicing muslim? Probably not.,"For over 40 years we have had an activist Supreme Court... finding stuff in the constitution that actually isn't there..Legislat
ing from the bench because our legislators are too cowardly to specifically address issues so they kick it to the Supreme Court.. Now with a third conservative justice the court shall be what is supposed to be ... independent power from the legislators....
and will interpret the constitution as it was meant to be interpreted.","Ridiculous to assume that someone who ""lives"" a religion can keep this religious life out of their thinking process. I'll leave you to decide whether this is a good thing or something else.","So ..justices without any religious view are preferred then? If you are religious ... you can be a lawyer::: State Supreme Court Justice::: Appellate Court Justice.. but US Supreme court justice.. sorry since you LIVE your religion you are not allowed to be a justice??????!!
!! ... Is that Harvard's view? a little religious bigotry seeping out of those revered halls of education.",Is Harvard now campaigning for packing the Courts?,No bcz justice is legue😎,Just shows how incompetent and left leaning this Harvard scholar is,I know it’s hard for people of low intelligence to understand::: but to be a Justice on the SC you need to put the law above your religious views. This Christo Fascist Nazi has built her entire career on the idea that she is a religious bigot and will work to enact Christian “Sharia Law”.,How many feelings will be hurt by her confirmation?,"Who legitimizes the dark legacy of Justice Scalia?

Dr. Uri Weiss

""The editors of the Harvard Law Review respectfully dedicate this issue to Justice Antonin Scalia."" (Nov. 10::: 2016)

Justice Scalia was a racist person::: who wished to send gay people to jail. Why did Harvard Law Review honor this homophobic judge?

During her hearing in the Senate::: Judge Amy Coney Barrett said: “I felt like I knew the justice before I ever met him::: because I had read so many of his colorful::: accessible opinions...More
than the style of his writing::: though::: it was the content of Justice Scalia’s reasoning that shaped me. His judicial philosophy was straightforward
: A judge must apply the law as written::: not as the judge wishes it were. Sometimes that approach meant reaching results that he did not like.”

The people who granted legitimacy to the legacy of this sinister judge are first of all the so-called liberal law professors who have no courage to say that Justice Scalia was a cruel person::: who acted to deprive people of their freedom because of their sexual orientation. In other words::: Justice Scalia was a sex offender::: a person who attempts to force people to have only heterosexual intercourse by using threats to arrest them.

Why have the students of Harvard not protested? One plausible answer is that they were afraid. They do not believe that true freedom of speech on this matter exists at Harvard. This is just one example of how the so-called liberal law academia attempts to maintain a good relationship with the legal establishment::: cooperates with the crimes of the legal systems::: and fails to apply its privilege in order to resist.",You must believe that if you continue to support the far left who beliefs are Marxist,"Harvard just announced one of the new Fellows for the school’s Future of Diplomacy Project: Saeb Erekat::: a Palestinian politician who is also an architect of the infamous 400 million dollar a year ""Martyr's Fund."" This is a Palestinian government program that pays salaries to terrorists::: in part using foreign aid money from our tax dollars.","Of course not::: the whole hypocritical and dishonest claim is intelligence insulting and impudent to me.
This hearing was a farce::: the main actor: A delusional cult member/
religious zealot::: a disgusting::: ignorant mass breeding woman who traveled forward in time from the 50s or worse... 🙄","Welcome to The Socialists House of Hell::: what is it 90-100k a year to become a Marxist and Socialist these days.

I think we waste so much time and energy attacking one another because of his/her political affiliation and defending one of these two. Name calling and bickering::: lies... We should just agree that Trump works for us::: that he‘s our employee and we may or may not renew his contract on November 3rd. And Biden is applying for that same job. So::: It’s our responsibility to hire the right employee for the position.,"No

To me::: the detailed platform vs. our need at the time are what matter most.,Probably Like never before::: has the World being So Aware of Politics. On Every Air Way::: All over Social Media and Radio Stations too.,Liberal Party and PDP Laban are already Lining Up. Just Commission on Election is what both parties waiting for.,Has the DNC woken Biden up for the debate yet? Or is he sleeping still?,Will Biden use his dementia as a superpower during the debate? #trump2020,It's just another debate::: the reality starts from joining the office. I hope the leaders bring back peace to the WORLD.,I certainly know which one is terrible and a risk to national security with the debts he owes.,“Experts offer tips on what to look for in a presidential debate” how about a president!? Oxymoron.,Reading some of these comments makes me wonder how many contributors are Harvard alum...and how many are actually human vs bots?,People in Germany feel sad about the tone of this debate. Respect is missing::: facts are called fake & scientific Proof is ignored.... mainly by Trump,Biden must win in order to allow Harris::: Soros::: Gates et al to continue to destroy this democracy.,they’re having those this election?,Nope. Trump will dominate the debate. He is not a fair fighter.,Second::: 2/3 of the Americans did not take their decision yet. Many are volatiles and some may not go to vote. Everything will depend on the stake and the personality of each candidate. Polls are have started to be very tied. Nothing is done yet even if I belive that Trump is going to be reelected. The major state will be whether he's going to simultaneously win the college and popular vote.,First::: it's relevant to really understand the stakes. In general the presidential debate is made to find out whether any given candidate is presidential or not. Is he articulated? How is he defend himself? Can he explain his agenda in a relative short period of time? Will he be a unifier or a divider?,"I will be excited to watch Trump
I would also want to know what new does joe biden has ..since he has been in government like forever",I hope so. I’ve changed direction as a voter so many times during this election. I don’t even know which candidate is good anymore.,America will see who remembers facts and who can’t. Trump 2020🇺🇸,horrible article! A total bias perspective. Don't waste internet space with this.,Chris Wallace is a Harvard graduate (Harvard is mainly elite establishment blue) and is himself a Democrat. We know where he will lean in moderating the debate. As such I wouldn't take the debate too seriously because it will be politically biased ala the precedent of a left leaning moderator.,With 35 days left::: it might. But Trump is capable of trying anything to prevent a Biden win. Anything. The debate tonight might be the ballgame.,Biden or trump? the next vice will be more important!,I hope the one who wins can nuke China if the time comes and there's no other choice just nuke the fcking country,Biased reporting starting with somehow not finding a single photo of President Trump smiling. In all fairness::: Biden's photo isn't better. How about getting good photos for both!,biden should hide yourself from this::: iuhuhauhahua. i will be a great shame of,Would love to follow the debate::: any one knows the time??/.,I want to know whose going to pick Biden up after TRUMP slams his aas to the canvaa 1. 2. 3 .hes out,I agree Donald the strongest candidate.

His cronies at faux news will laud his speaking skills and say that's what the Ameican people want to hear. It truly is a sad time in this country.,Trump should just concede all the time to Biden and let him talk for the whole 90 minutes.,Hope Trump can focus on policies and facts. His messages have been off topic and filled with personal insults.,Biden will be taking a cocktail of drugs to stimulate his mind and he will be fed all the answers through an earpiece. No doubt he has had the questions and he has been practicing non stop!,hopefully tonight's debate set the scene who to be the next leader.,Climate change never mentioned,This debate will not change the course::: Trump will certainly win this election.,Maybe changes but there are next debates,Can’t look for much when all candidates aren’t included in the “debate.”,"We all know the answer to that.

Biden better bring his A game. This better not be some after debate trump is the only fact checked person.,Kinda hard to debate somebody for whom even objective facts are something to lie about::: and whose followers do not care if he lies or really about anything he does other than screw over people they don't like.,Obviously Trump is colour peach and he better be a MOP✌️✌️,Gonna be a cringe filled evening!,RUBBISH::: BIASED::: LEFT-LEANING::: LIBERAL ARTICLE.,And now the time has come for 45 trump::: to have a Mental Breakdown.

If anything it proves how dependant we are on aesthetics even at the cost of our own freedoms. This country has a severe mental illness.,Tonight debate Will shows the strength of MR Trump whose contribution and ideas in strengthen America during her moment of challenges will leave no stone unturned::: I strongly believe that Mr president Trump is the best president ofUnited::: He needs our encouragement and support :::. No leader can do good things alone::: let's encourage him for another four years::: I believe America will be great again...,"One will be an incoherent mess with what's left of his grey matter dribbling from his ears:::mumbling::: stuttering and making desperate claims and calls to his legitimacy and distracting from his utter inneffectivenes
s and lack of policy.

The other is Joe Biden",Biden will ruin Trump. Biden will lay out his plans and policies::: while Trump will lie about everything.,"It will. We will see Donald Trump in all his stupidity::: fatigue and incoherence. I mean::: he is protected by an inner circle that says what he wants to hear!

All he can say now are lies so transparent that they insult our intelligence and it will be::: the most devastating debate ever recorded in the US. He is not the same man than in 2016. He is far worst mentally.

Also::: since he knows he will go to prison if he loses::: he will do anything to be elected and desperate measures are rarely an efficient way of winning a National election. Also::: black women are strong voters::: do you think they are going to support him? That’s why he tries by all means to suppress their vote. But it won’t work.

I feel pity for this man::: this con artist will have the most horrifying downfall ever witnessed in US history.

The town liar is going to get beaten senseless... and that’s what he deserves.",Or people can watch it and make their own opinions. One of the greatest errors of liberal logic is trinkle down thinking. Lot of times science doesn't even support their position. What is the most deadly virus in the past 10 years? Coronavirus is a boom bust::: but where BLV causing breast cancer has been a holistic problem. Universities like Harvard are so full of themselves at times::: they can't even see the obvious. Viruses that evolved for different species may still find an active site on human cells. They may not even cause an infection but because of the active site on the cell membrane they can push in enzymes designed to mess around with DNA. BLV in a cow would be about self replication in the utter to transfer to new generations through milk::: in a human cell the code may fail but it leaves damage dna or dna with extra virus code attached inside that may stimulate the cell. Harvard is completely blind to the obvious. Lot of these problems come from liberals who want power over emotions and are at the very end of the day control freaks. Places like Harvard need tools like differential equations that model biological life population patterns::: like lotka-volterra that shows a boom bust pattern::: and then compare that to cancer incident rates. If the virus has a high population that causes cancer it causes more::: if its in a low cycle it causes less.. the rate of change in incident rates over decades may spot if a cancer is caused by a biologic. If its a market driven product::: it may had data artifacts that transfer over in incidence rate characteristic of market driven data. This is the reason I kind of make fun of Harvard politics. Harvard has some incredible brilliant people::: and is a good social networking place::: but they insist on trickle down thinking which is provable false ideology. Its provable false because if one takes like google ai::: the concept to get optimal ideas is to spread the starting points out. Similarly if the best ideas come from the best search algorithms::: pee down thinking of liberals is an incredible low order. Harvard articles like the above are about a system of control than a system of find and implementing the best ideas.,"Drinking / smoking game... take a drink or toke when trump lies::: or Biden forgets the question or what he was saying.

The inner workings of a plant are the exact same chemistry that occurs inside people::: while the bio-molecule has some purpose in the plant::: there a chance it interacts with the human body in some way and in some form. By chance some will be beneficial and by chance some will be harmful::: or any shade in between. In all the randomness::: that one bean fava bean::: turned out to inhibit the Parkinson's prion. Which lead to the medication levidopa. Large percentage of US medications where first discovered in plant extracts. Which is why in the 80 and 90s it was popular for explorers to find plants in the Amazon to draw from millions of different unique chemicals::: some of which could improve outcomes for some horrible cancers. Now that Researchers are improving their understanding of gut flora::: not only is this vast diversity have unique effects on the body::: some could end up interacting with the gut ecology to produce beneficial or harmful effects. In case of Parkinson's the Prion that causes it comes from the gut::: travels up the Vagus nerve. It took researchers a long time to figure that out::: by first reports of vagus nerve being cut vastly lowered Parkinson's. So they followed the nerve down and found low fiber diets cause a gut bacteria that normally beneficial to get the fiber from the intestine lining. But they don't know what specie is creating the prion. They know its a gut microbe because in mice studies gut sterile mice wouldn't get Parkinson. They would only get Parkinson disease if a gut culture from mice that would get Parkinson was put in the mice. Gut Ecology is a huge number of species. It could be some random substance just knocks out that harmful specie. But that research raises huge question about colon health::: because if gut microbes are getting fibers from the intestine in low fiber diets::: what other problems is it causing.

Then republicans that are racist aren't going to rush to end abortion because almost all abortions are done by minorities. Free Market has already solved the abortion issue by accessibility to IUDs::: which in Colorado vastly dropped the abortion rate. That republican party wants to be social engineering and communist like in social control. If the supreme court said abortion was a state's choice::: the black market would provide illegal drugs to hide abortions. It makes the problem much worse.

Step 1::: count the variations in admission techniques. There is infinite number of them. The perspective of google's method of ai::: is to take a measurement of a point in the space of admission structures::: and look for an optimal point. However::: its not just one measurement::: its a system of measurements. In addition Harvard can't explore the space of choices as easily as a computer simulation for fitness value. The sheer size and variations possible and the difficulty and complexity of searching for optimal choices::: its incredible likely the optimal choice remains illusive. Its also likely Harvard admission is stuck in a steepest decent value. The correct way would be to allow school vouchers to add variation and diversity of choices in education::: and with a system of universities that explore the choice space::: places like Harvard could draw from those to improve. So in court it could be demonstrated there is no perfect admission standards::: and that Harvard by itself can not make the leaps to get into more optimal choices.

The statistics of singling out Harvard::: maybe its just Harvard is doing the right thing and just fell one way on standard deviations. So the above argument gets into the core of the data collected::: and is it correct to take a measurement of Harvard and say the system is broken? No::: one has to look at many sample spaces to get a feel if current admission cenetics::: the conceptual genetic structure::: is working or not. The correct way would be to measure over several academic admissions and find common concepts like average and standard deviations. Court shouldn't single out a university like Harvard if they are not significantly below a standard deviation for performance. It could also be that Harvard is doing the right thing::: but that the investments in change of structure takes time to mature. That means yearly trend data also matters. Harvard being a private university the statistics could be representing there are family traditions of going to Harvard. Once all the data is properly accounted for::: it could be that Harvard has no problems at all::: and its just some people getting all worked up over statistical illusions.

When asked why she’d take such a huge risk—especially
when the Nazi regime had placed a seven-figure bounty on her head—she replied: “Aus anstand.” Out of decency.

If General Patton and Marlene Dietrich would return to life today::: both would be appalled to see that the American universities have become Nazi-Marxist indoctrination hubs::: for a lost generation of worthless young Americans. It is a tragedy that these vicious creatures::: who hate the United States::: represent the nation's intellectual elite.

I guess both would say: ""Was it for this that hundreds of thousands of young Americans sacrificed their lives to free the world from Nazi tyranny?""

#MabuhayHarvard","“Einstein and all the scientists did not understand the mass–energy equivalence equation E = mc^2::: because it is Not an ‘equivalence’::: it is a fact::: because in Ferent Quantum Gravity mass is made of light::: Gamma rays”
Adrian Ferent

“In 2018 Adrian Ferent discovered mass–energy equivalence for Dark Matter E = md × vp^2::: added it to E = mc^2 and Ferent’s mass–energy equivalence equation: E= mc^2 + md × vp^2”
Adrian Ferent

“In electron and positron collision Gamma rays are created because electrons and positrons are made of Gamma rays”
Adrian Ferent

“Because in Ferent Quantum Gravity the electrons are made of Gamma rays and Dark Matter::: is the first proofs for the mass–energy equivalence equation: E = mc^2 “
Adrian Ferent

“Because in Ferent Quantum Gravity the electrons are made of Gamma rays and Dark Matter::: is the first proofs for Ferent’s mass–energy equivalence equation: E= mc^2 + md × vp^2 “
Adrian Ferent

Mass-energy equivalence
E = mc^2 states that the equivalent energy E is the mass multiplied by the square of the speed of light.
This is the most famous equation in the world::: the one defining the relation between mass and energy.

In 1704 Newton wrote in his book “Opticks”:
""Gross bodies and light are convertible into one another...""
With this words Newton created the mass-energy equivalence principle::: which urged later scientists to find mathematical solutions for his logical hypothesis.

In 1873 Nikolay Umov created an equation for mass energy transformation:
E=kmc^2 where 0:::5 ≤ k ≤ 1

In 1900 H. Poincare and in 1903 Olinto de Pretto concluded too::: that the relation between energy and mass is E = mc^2.

In 1905 Albert Einstein did not formulate exactly the equation E=mc2 but he said: ’if a body gives off the energy L in the form of radiation::: its mass diminishes by L/c2’. Thus means for Einstein the inertial mass of an object changes if the object absorbs or emits energy.

“In 2018 Adrian Ferent discovered mass–energy equivalence for Dark Matter E = md × vp^2::: added it to E = mc^2 and Ferent’s mass–energy equivalence equation: E= mc^2 + md × vp^2”
Adrian Ferent

Adrian Ferent discovered that:

“In Ferent Quantum Gravity the electrons::: the positrons::: Matter and Antimatter are made of Gamma rays and Dark Matter”
Adrian Ferent

“Because in Ferent Quantum Gravity the electrons are made of Gamma rays and Dark Matter::: is the first proofs for the mass–energy equivalence equation: E = mc^2 “
Adrian Ferent

“Because in Ferent Quantum Gravity the electrons are made of Gamma rays and Dark Matter::: is the first proofs for Ferent’s mass–energy equivalence equation: E= mc^2 + md × vp^2 “
Adrian Ferent

“In electron and positron collision Gamma rays are created because electrons and positrons are made of Gamma rays”
Adrian Ferent

Einstein said; “You know::: it would be sufficient to understand the electron” which is still true today.

“Conclusion: No Conclusion. So::: what is an electron? An electron is a particle::: and a wave; it is ideally simple::: and unimaginably complex; it is precisely understood::: and utterly mysterious; it is rigid::: and subject to creative disassembly. No single answer does justice to reality. ” – Frank Wilczek

“The electron is not an elementary particle::: because it is composed of a Photon and a Dark Matter electron”
Adrian Ferent

That is why the Standard model is wrong.

“The high energy Gravitons emitted by Dark Matter keep the photon inside the electron”
Adrian Ferent

“The electron energy is the sum of the photon energy and the Dark Matter electron energy”
Adrian Ferent

“The particle energy E::: is the sum of Matter energy and Dark Matter energy:
E = Em + Edm”
Adrian Ferent

”Ferent’s mass–energy equivalence equation: E=mc^2 + md × vp^2 “
Adrian Ferent

I am the first who calculated the Dark Matter energy:

“Ferent’s Dark Matter mass-energy equivalence equation: E = md × vp^2”
Adrian Ferent

Where md is the Dark Matter mass and vp is the Dark Photons speed.

“Ferent mass–energy equivalence principle is another proof for Ferent Quantum Gravity”
Adrian Ferent

If the object is massless::: in the case for a single photon::: then the equation is: E=pc.

“Ferent equation for elementary particle::: made of 2 particles::: a Matter particle and a Dark Matter particle::: is the Unification between Matter and Dark Matter!”
Adrian Ferent

Proofs for my theory:

1. “Antimatter and Matter will annihilate both::: leaving behind pure energy::: Gamma rays and Dark Matter”.
Adrian Ferent

2. “Because in Ferent Quantum Gravity the electrons are made of Gamma rays and Dark Matter::: is the first proofs for the mass–energy equivalence equation: E = mc^2 “
Adrian Ferent

3. “Ferent’s E= mc^2 + md × vp^2 is not mass–energy equivalence equation::: is the proofs that Matter is made of Gamma rays and Dark Matter”
Adrian Ferent

Einstein described the equivalence of mass and energy as “the most important upshot of the special theory of relativity” (Einstein 1919)::: for this result lies at the core of modern physics.

“Einstein and all the scientists did not understand the mass–energy equivalence equation E = mc^2::: because it is Not an ‘equivalence’::: it is a fact::: because in Ferent Quantum Gravity mass is made of light::: Gamma rays”
Adrian Ferent

At particle accelerators the scientists do not understand what they collide::: because they do not understand what Matter is::: what Antimatter is and what Dark Matter is.

In Ferent Quantum Gravity the concept::: the idea mass–energy equivalence is wrong::: is incorrect::: because it is not ‘equivalence’::: it is a fact::: because mass is made of light::: Gamma rays!

Those same states have Governors who intentionally put sick patients of all ages inside those nursing homes. You will find proof of this in the pending inquisitions within Congress. The overwhelming majority of Covid cases::: beyond this::: are sparse and measured only when combined with flu and pneumonia::: by tests that even the CDC claim are 50% effective- rendering them null and void.

Do you want to make a lot of money?
Do you want to be part of the biggest company::: the fastest growing one?

s-PartOne

So many times::: aspiring consultants reach out to consulting firms::: colleagues::: and schools::: but overall::: aren't really getting the help or training they need to advance if they don't have the right connections. For example::: I have seen only a few business schools and external organizations establish ""small programs"" to let aspiring consultants work on client engagements::: but you have to live in their country and be available to work ""in-person"" and attend meetings. I know because I tried to work with some of these institutions after detailed research and applying::: but was rejected. These things happen all the time::: but YOU CAN STILL CONSULT.

If you're an aspiring consultant and haven't received an INTERVIEW or OFFER to work for a consulting firm yet (or even if you have)::: I encourage you to reserve a seat for yourself and a friend in the masterclass! I've also sent this masterclass invitation to a LARGE portion of my networks around the world::: on 6 continents::: and I know SEATS WILL FILL UP FAST! So::: reserve yours TODAY by clicking here: https://bit.ly/

trials by DOST reveal virgin coconut oil’s promising results on treating::: managing COVID Virgin coconut oil can possibly help prevent::: manage and treat COVID-19 patients::: research says. ANCX | Aug 03 2020 The Department of Science and Technology (DOST) is currently doing trials to see how effective VCO is in combatting the COVID-19 virus::: but have noted promising results. As trials for coronavirus vaccines are still underway::: we are left with no choice but to simply wait and do the necessary safety precautions—wea
r a mask and a face shield::: wash our hands thoroughly::: and observe physical distancing. But what if we add another to-do? According to Dr. Fabian M. Dayrit::: president of the Integrated Chemists of the Philippines::: we’ve got something locally available that can help prevent::: manage::: and treat novel coronavirus patients—virgin
coconut oil (VCO). The doctor has been doing his studies on coconut oil for over 15 years. “There are two general strategies against viral diseases. First::: to develop drugs which are directly antiviral::: and second::: to use the body’s own immune system to defend [itself] against the virus:::” noted a research by Dr. Dayrit and Dr. Mary T. Newport::: a neonatologist::: international speaker::: and an advocate for using coconut oil. According to Dr. Dayrit::: there are enough studies to prove that VCO has antiviral and immunomodulator
y properties. Upon ingestion::: coconut oil produces lauric acid and monolaurin::: two compounds which have been known for many years to have significant antiviral activity. Dr. Jose Mondejar::: medical director Equilibrium Integrative Health Clinic::: who had reached out to Dr. Dayrit regarding his VCO studies::: gave the oil to 69 residents of Sitio Luz::: Barangay Zapatera. They were among the first COVID-19 patients of Cebu City in April. They initially took 1 tablespoon of VCO twice a day::: which later increased to thrice a day::: he said in an interview with DZMM. Within 2 weeks::: 45 of the 69 patients tested negative::: while 24 did not develop worse symptoms. Similarly::: VCO is also credited for keeping the Cebu Provincial Detention and Rehabilitation Center (CPDRC) COVID-free. After taking VCO starting May 15::: 7 jail workers with COVID-19 tested negative for the pathogen within a week. Three other workers tested negative within 8 days::: he said. The jail has not tallied any new case of COVID-19 since. Dr. Dayrit::: who’s also a professor at the Ateneo de Manila University-Scho
ol of Science and Engineering's chemistry department::: clarifies that these are not clinical studies. “They were invited to treat people::: not to do a study. What we did was to gather data so that it can be explained more rationally. In 30 days::: [the confirmed COVID positive patients] were all eventually negative:::” said Dr. Dayrit. For more information you can type www. Coconut Research Center. Org in a browser with no places. One can cook with coconut oil. It does not create body damaging free radicals like most cooking oils and the saturated fat is of a type good for the body.",🥰,nice pic,...Skill is what you are capable of.

I was walking in a forested area when a white drone::: the size of a small plane::: appeared in a clearing. It made a sound::: as if the rushing of waters. Then::: the sound stopped and so did the drone. It stopped: it was stationary in the sky! It remained stationary for some time. Then the 'rushing of waters' returned and it moved forward. The shape of it looked weird - I had never seen anything like it before. I contacted some friends and they knew of it::: it was possibly an MQ1 drone::: operated by the Army or Airforce. There's but one reason for its existence: the monitoring and tracking of the American people: it is there to incarcerate society. It is said to be capable of disrupting the neural network in the brain. Just such a disruption of the neural network occurred 3 years ago when I was knocked unconscious. And then again a year later. At that time I was not aware of the existence of such drones. Imagine the power of the criminals who have created this drone and are operating it::: to end normal life. They have the power that the population cannot match. An incarceration of society is now underway. Below is a link to an essay that describes the ways that they're operating to enslave us.

“Let me tell you a story about racism. The first actual afro-latino valedictorian of Harvard Law School::: Pedro Albizu Campos graduated in 1921. He graduated while simultaneously studying Literature::: philosophy::: Chemical Engineering::: and Military Science. He was fluent in six modern and two classical languages: English::: Spanish::: French::: German::: Portuguese::: Italian::: Latin::: and ancient Greek.
Pedro was denied the valedictorian distinction by a professor who delayed his final grade to keep him from having the highest grade point average in the 1921 class. They wanted to avoid the ""embarrassment""
of having a black Puerto Rican be the valedictorian of one of the most prestigious law schools in the country.

Pedro Albizu Campos turned down a Supreme Court clerkship::: multiple prestigious firm offers::: and plum government appointments to go back to Puerto Rico and practice poverty law. Instead of making himself wealthy::: he worked for folks and often receive payment in the form of chickens from poor farmers. He then began to lead the nascent independence movement of Puerto Rico. For this::: he was targeted by Hoover's FBI and eventually thrown in prison for leading the independence movement. At the time::: it was illegal to fly the Puerto Rican flag.

Pedro Albizu Campos suffered for years in prison and was subject to horrific torture and human experiments. They experimented on him using radiation. This was at a time where the U.S. military deliberately exposed Puerto Rican men to mustard gas to see how it affected them. He later suffered a stroke after a decade in prison and was pardoned and released only to die months later in 1965.

This is only a very brief retelling of this story. Racism is baked into the DNA of the United States government and how it's treated Puerto Rican people. Having a law degrees from an Ivy League school doesn't protect you when you go against the system. I recommend you read the book The War Against All Puerto Ricans to get a better picture of his life.”",I REMEMBER WALKING IN THAT STAIR..

Corona Virus And The Decisive Statement That Is Not To Be Taken for Amusement

In the name of Allah The One::: The Perpetual Forgiver::: The Almighty::: The Overpowering::: blessings and peace be upon the chosen prophet Mohammed::: the messenger of Allah::: sent with the Reminder [The Quran] to all mankind.

O decision makers::: the leaders of man and their peoples in all countries::: I advise you of one thing only: - that you stand for Allah::: in pairs and individually::: and then give thought to who Allah proved his challenge to be true in reality with regards to the so-called corona virus!

Did Allah not challenge doctors altogether::: or did He challenge the awaited Mahdi::: the servant of Allah and His caliph the Imam Mahdi::: Nasser Mohammed Al-Yemeni? That is for you to know with certainty that you will never encompass anything of His knowledge except for what He wills::: Exalted is He and high above what you associate with Him and High above what you deviate because of being deluded by what you have of modern science.

And He has encompassed you with what the former people did not have the knowledge of::: then you became deluded concerning what you have of the knowledge of Information Technology and the knowledge in different fields and that is why He Has challenged you with what you do not have knowledge about::: which it is one of the smallest soldiers of Allah::: until He made your knowledge equal to zero::: O you who have rejoiced in the knowledge you have.

And you thought that you are capable of everything::: as a result::: Allah Has insulted your ability::: humiliated your pride::: and Has removed your vanity with the smallest soldier from his creation that cannot be seen by the naked eye due to its tiny size::: and that is for you to know the worth of yourselves.

Peace be upon the messengers::: and praise to Allah::: Lord of the worlds.

The caliph and the servant of Allah:::
Imam Mahdi Nasser Muhammad Al-Yamani

This Statement was published by The imam Mahdi 6 days before that The WHO declared for the first time CORONAVIRUS as a world epidemic.
🇺🇸👇🇺🇸🌷🇺🇸👇🇺🇸
And I see the world health organization do not consider it an international disease yet! In fact with their claim that they will control it::: they are indeed liars. How can they control Allah’s chastisement?!
But I am Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammad Al-Yemeni a khalifa of Allah over the worlds I issue fatwa to you with Truth that it is not a mere international disease in fact a global chastisement::: and since it is sort of minor chastisement before the major chastisement then definitely the death toll is few initially but now the infected ones are in the millions yet many of them do not know that they are infected::: and this is cunning from Allah so they infect other people they think themselves are secure from Allah’s chastisement suffocating the respiratory system::: so it would constrict him breathing air little by little as if he elevates up in the sky until he suffocates because of the constriction of his respiratory system and its channel::: so how Allah would not afflict the arrogant of whom Allah pleases from among them while they deserve the most to be burned therein? Those who turn away from the reminder of their Lord for they may return (to Him)::: and Allah would annihilate of them whom he pleases from among them as admonishment to the worlds for they may return back to their True Lord by pleading and supplicating to remove His chastisement away from them promising Allah to follow His Book the grand Quran and asking Allah steadfastness Who comes between them and their hearts so they would beseech from Allah to make their hearts steadfast to fulfill what they promised Him to avoid them His chastisement then removes it away from them to follow His Book the grand Quran so they be of these who are guided aright.
With what I want to seal this explanatory-sta
tement of mine is the call from Allah in His decisive Book during an admonition of His chastisement by the chest disease. Confirming with the word of Allah the Most High: {O people::: there has come to you indeed an admonition from your Lord and a healing for what is in the chests; and a guidance and a mercy for the believers.}Trut
hful Allah the Great [Younus] 10:57.. Surely this is a chastisement admonition::: a wisdom for the dutiful ones.
{يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ قَدْ جَاءَتْكُم مَّوْعِظَةٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ وَشِفَاءٌ لِّمَا فِي الصُّدُورِ وَهُدًى وَرَحْمَةٌ لِّلْمُؤْمِنِين
َ﴿٥٧﴾} صدق الله العظيم [يونس]
I know that this is a chastisement::: pain and great horror to people for they may repent then worship Allah::: Him Alone no partner for Him::: and they repent from the grave sins::: oppression and indecencies what appears of it and what is hidden::: secretly and openly. And they would make a complete ablution to worship Allah the One::: the Supreme::: then they do not call on anyone with Allah::: and you (should) know the sure knowledge that it is a hidden global chastisement as a cunning from Allah the One::: the Supreme. And it is not a mere disease as you claim::: far from::: very far::: indeed you shall know::: so flee from Allah to Him::: verily I’m a clear warner to you from Him::: and do not shut down His houses for who flee to their Lord to uphold prayer to their Lord::: Him Alone no partner for Him::: and he who enters Allah’s Houses to worship His Lord he is secure from the virus of suffocation even if entered with him the infected ones who flee to Allah::: surely it would not afflict the righteous worshipers who believe (trust) and rely on their Lord::: so (trust) relying on Allah if you indeed are believers.
Know that coronavirus is a new chastisement of a mighty power; disease of chests::: little by little until it cuts off the breath of whom Allah pleases::: and who is healed from it let him know that it is not because of the physicians’ treatment; rather because of his supplication prayer to Allah the most Merciful than all who have mercy::: it should not be for them to find a cure-treatment for Allah’s chastisement to the fact it is not an affliction for purging what is in your chests; in fact (it is) a chastisement that afflicts chests of whom Allah pleases of those whom among you turn away for they may return (to Allah)::: and some of you whom death makes him die by chastisement of suffocation that is what they call it [coronavirus] and it is only from the minor chastisement to many people for they may return and plead to their Lord so He would remove from them the evil of the chastisement consequently they would follow the grand Quran the True Book from their Lord.

O community of the dead (by) corona from chastisement of Allah::: inform the inmates of hell before you::: (tell them) to not wait for intercession of anyone from His servants on judgement day::: they should call on Allah the Most merciful to them rather than His servants::: surely His promise is ever True by responding and He is the Most Merciful (more so than all) the merciful ones::: inform them that Allah::: if He shut for them door of repentance from evil deeds to the fact they would never do evil after death::: in fact each soul would wish that between it and what it has done of evil (deeds) a far distant-time::: rather say to them: Indeed::: if Allah had shut the door of deeds after death — in the Book — verily He did not shut door of (supplication) prayer::: glory be to Him::: How can He shut door of His generosity and His mercy. Indeed::: His promise is ever True and He is the Most Merciful (more so than all) the merciful ones?

Quote1 From the statement of The Awaited Imam Nasser Muhammad Al Yamani
🇺🇸👇🇺🇸🌷🇺🇸👇🇺🇸
Our fatwa has preceded with Truth that what they call it coronavirus has a source that is not unknown in the decisive grand Quran; (some tiniest-creatur
e) yet they do not encompass knowledge about it::: and the word (some) is built for the upcoming unknown::: and here it is the time of fulfilling the setting of parable has come; the promised challenge from Allah in the Book. As that the new sorts of viruses against the humans which has lengthy lifespan; amphibious::: air-floater::: winter(y)::: summer(y)::: it is equipped with its source; a miracle from Allah to live in all (seasonal) climates in order to be a worldwide chastisement::: and it is not as the epidemic verses that the humans know; in fact::: it has lengthy lifespan; it lives in the human’s body cunning (being contagious) from (one) human being to (another) human being exclusively::: then it lives in the open air after its exiting from the body so it would live as well without a body till when Allah pleases in order to afflict others::: being driven by the command of its Lord afflicting therewith whom He pleases and turning it away from whom He pleases. and the source has a big role it carries out its role with exceeding speed::: and it is some tiny creature yet your eyes do not see it. An addition in the creation and challenge from Allah::: a new creation (some tiniest-creatur
e) as if it is a war plain; in fact it is faster than your war plains and your land::: air and space missiles by a great difference it travels by Allah’s words glory be to Him::: and its mission is entering into the chest of a human being to scatter its eggs into the chests a scattering with exceeding speed laying its eggs inside the chest of a human being::: in order for its virus offspring to be transmitted from humans to humans after the eggs are hatched then it multiply and divide inside the body of a human being as the spread of fire in dry straw so it would transmit from a human being to another human being. And by now means and never infect an animal nor birds no matter what they lie to you surely they will not and would never bring the clear scientific proof::: also will not and would never afflict the seen mosquito at all::: in fact its hidden source is (Alba-oodah) the hidden tiny creature and it is the set parable in the creation by be and it is also it does not have a male that Allah created it from it nor has a female mother has laid it; in fact::: a tiny creature (ba-ooda) of challenge::: a new parable among the nations of tiny creatures. And it is (ba-oodah) tiny creature that Allah created with words of His power “Be” and it is. And it is not of the stingers nor the carriers of your disease from species of the known mosquito that you have::: holly Allah. In fact it is of the piercing penetrating (creature) that has an extraordinary exceeding speed that takes one of the humans who it invades him into his chest so it would take it as incubator for its eggs then it scatters its eggs with extraordinary speed scattering::: then it departs the body::: set off with extremely high speed leaving its eggs inside the chest of the human being::: so it would hatch through its nursery then viruses sprout from it and multiply in the body of a human being into (many) viruses::: and (center) its activity is in the chest. As for the factory of eggs for the lord obeying (ba-oodah) minute creature it leaves the body directly::: and only it makes the human being as a nursery for its eggs until it hatches then spread in the body (like) spreading of fire in the dry straw::: also center of multiplication of it is in the chest so it would infect by the tiny-seeds of its eggs from which it emerges::: as that the way of infections to other people from a human being to another human being::: through the open air; an air swimmers; so it would remain as living creatures in the air::: and it is not a mere world pandemic passing through::: willing he who pleased and rejects he who refused::: because the passing through pandemic is a cloud and it diminishes. Fare from::: very far::: I did not declare it to the humans as a mere world pandemic passing through; in fact I announced it (being) a world chastisement continuing night and day by Allah’s command::: the One::: the Subduer::: in various countries of the worlds with fluctuating levels from one person to another. For each are levels according to what they did::: some of it a warning and some of it an evil spread far and wide; in fact the new mother minute creature (Ba-oodah) is a worldwide calamity from the minor chastisement for you may humble yourselves to your Lord and beseech to Him repenting turning near to Him to have mercy for you so He would remove away from His chastisement::: so you would follow His Book the grand Quran. Then you obey Allah’s khalifa over the worlds::: His servant Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammad Al-Yemeni.

So do not be haughty above Allah’s khalifa then He would curse you a grievous curse as He cursed satan who got haughty above prostration to Adam; the human being — first khalifa of Allah — of mankind. So do not think the Imam Mahdi is dumb::: in fact smart and I am aware of I say::: I still insist that what you call it coronavirus is a living creature breaks-down and splits in the bodies of humans. There is no virus of its kind in the bodies of pigs::: donkeys::: cows::: camels nor in the entire cattle::: and the entire animals and birds are being disassociated from this world chastisement that continues night and day in various climates among the worlds.

I was a girl in the village doing all right
Then I became a princess over night
Now I gotta figure out how to do it right
So much to learn and see!

Up in the castle with my new family
And a school that's just for royalty
A whole enchanted world is waiting for me
I'm so excited to be... (Sofia the First!)

Good Wi-Fi design begins with assessing how the network will be used. Talking to teachers::: administrators:::
and technology staff is the first step in determining user needs. An RF site survey is an important part of this process.

OUR LIVING WORLD: NOT INVENTED BY NATURE

JUST BECAUSE something exists in nature does not mean it was invented by nature. If all the chemicals (i.e. amino acids::: nucleic acids::: etc.) necessary to make a cell were left to themselves::: “Mother Nature” would have no ability to organize them into a cell. It requires an already existing cell to bring about another cell. The cell exists and reproduces in nature but nature didn’t invent or design it! Nature didn’t originate the cell or any form of life. An intelligent power outside of nature had to be responsible.

Miller::: in his famous experiment in 1953::: showed that amino acids (the building blocks of life) could form by chance. But::: it’s not enough just to have amino acids. The various amino acids that make-up life must link together in a precise sequence::: just like the letters in a sentence::: to form functioning protein molecules. It has never been shown that various amino acids can bind together into a sequence by chance to form protein molecules.

Natural laws may explain how an airplane or cell works::: but it’s not rational to believe that undirected natural laws can bring about an airplane or a cell.

ONCE YOU HAVE a complete and living cell then the genetic program (or code) and biological machinery exist to direct the formation of more cells::: but how could the cell have originated naturally when no directing code and mechanisms existed in nature?

Mathematicians have said any event in the universe with odds of 10 to 50th power or greater is impossible! The probability of just an average size protein molecule arising by chance is 10 to the 65th power. Even the simplest cell is made up of many millions of various protein molecules along with and DNA/RNA..

The late great British scientist Sir Frederick Hoyle calculated that the odds of even the simplest cell coming into existence by chance is 10 to the 40:::000th power! How large is this? Consider that the total number of atoms in our universe is 10 to the 82nd power.

The cell didn't evolve. A partially evolved cell would quickly disintegrate::: not wait millions of years to become complete and living.

WHAT ABOUT EVOLUTION? Only evolution within “kinds” is genetically possible (i.e. varieties of dogs::: cats::: horses::: cows::: etc.)::: but not evolution across “kinds” (i.e. from sea sponge to human). How could species have survived if their vital tissues::: organs::: reproductive systems were still evolving? Survival of the fittest would actually have prevented such evolution! Only limited evolution::: variations of already existing genes and traits::: is possible. Nature is mindless and has no ability to design and program entirely new genes for entirely new traits.

WHAT ABOUT NEW SPECIES: Although new species have come into existence::: they don't carry any new genes. They've become new species only because they can't be crossed back with the original parent stock for various biological reasons. A biological ""kind"" allows for new species but not new genes. Nature has no ability to invent new genes for new traits. Only limited variations and adaptations are possible in nature::: and all strictly within a biological ""kind"" (i.e. varieties of dogs::: cats::: etc.).

All species of plants and animals in the fossil record are found complete::: fully formed::: and fully functional. This is powerful evidence that all species came into existence as complete and fully formed from the beginning. This is only possible by creation.

What about natural selection? Natural selection doesn't produce biological traits or variations. It can only ""select"" from biological variations that are possible and which have survival value. That’s why it’s called natural “selection.” The real issue is what biological variations are possible::: not natural selection. Only variations and mutations of already existing genes or traits are possible.

Dr. Randy J. Guliuzza’s extensive research points to a better explanation than natural selection for variation and adaptation in nature. Dr. Guliuzza explains that species have pre-engineered mechanisms that enable organisms to continuously track and respond to environmental changes with system elements that correspond to human-designed tracking systems. This model is called CET (continuous environmental tracking). His research strongly indicates that living things have been pre-engineered to produce the right adaptations and changes required to live in changing environments. It’s much like a car that’s been pre-engineered so that the head lights turn on automatically when day changes to night.

Modern evolutionists believe and hope that over::: supposedly::: millions of years::: random mutations in the genetic code caused by environmental radiation will generate entirely new genes for natural selection to use. This is total blind and irrational faith on the part of evolutionists. It’s much like believing that randomly changing the sequence of letters in a romance novel::: over millions of years::: will turn it into a book on astronomy! That’s the kind of blind faith macro-evolution
ists have.

Mutations are accidents in the genetic::: are mostly harmful::: and have no capability of producing greater complexity in the code. Even if a good accident occurred::: for every good one there would be hundreds of harmful ones with the net result::: over time::: being harmful::: even lethal::: to the species. Even if a single mutation is not immediately harmful::: the accumulation of mutations over time will be harmful. At best::: mutations only produce further variations within a natural species. Most biological variations are not due to mutations but from new combinations of already existing genes.

What about genetic and biological similarities between species? Genetic information::: like other forms of information::: cannot happen by chance::: so it is more logical to believe that genetic and biological similarities between all forms of life are due to a common Designer who designed similar functions for similar purposes. It doesn't mean all forms of life are biologically related! Only genetic similarities within a natural species proves relationship because it's only within a natural species that members can interbreed and reproduce.

The actual similarity between ape and human DNA is between 70-87% not 99.8% as commonly believed. The original research stating 99.8% similarity was based on ignoring contradicting evidence. Only a certain segment of DNA between apes and humans was compared::: not the entire DNA genome.

All the fossils that have been used to support human evolution have been found to be either hoaxes::: non-human::: or human::: but not non-human and human (i.e. Neanderthal Man was discovered later to be fully human).

There has never been unanimous agreement among evolutionary scientists on ANY fossil evidence that has been used to support human evolution over the Many years::: Including LUCY.

Also::: so-called ""Junk DNA"" isn't junk. Although these ""non-coding"" segments of DNA don't code for proteins::: they have recently been found to be vital in regulating gene expression (i.e. when::: where::: and how genes are expressed::: so they're not ""junk"").

Romeo::: take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting::: all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story::: baby::: just say::: ""Yes""
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet::: 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while::: oh oh
'Cause you were Romeo::: I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said::: ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was beggin' you::: ""Please don't go::: "" and I said
Romeo::: take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting::: all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story::: baby::: just say::: ""Yes""
Romeo::: save me::: they're tryna tell me how to feel
This love is difficult::: but it's real
Don't be afraid::: we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story::: baby::: just say::: ""Yes""
Oh::: oh
I got tired of waiting
Wonderin' if you were ever comin' around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town::: and I said
Romeo::: save me::: I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you::: but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring
And said::: ""Marry me::: Juliet
You'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad::: go pick out a white dress
It's a love story::: baby::: just say::: ""Yes""
Oh::: oh::: oh
Oh::: oh::: oh::: oh

They think they picked it up on the plane trip back home as they were not sick in Viet Nam and the family back there didnt get sick.

"Today the U.S. government withdrew the ICE directive that would have prevented international students from staying in the country if they attend institutions that are holding courses online this fall.

“At a time when this pandemic continues to rage::: we must continue to act with vigilance::: informed by the best available science and with a commitment both to carrying forward the vital enterprise of learning and to safeguarding public health. The ICE directive sought to force each of us to choose between the health of our communities and the education of our international students—a false and dangerous choice which we rejected. In the end::: the public overwhelmingly agreed with us::: and the government::: in response::: withdrew its order.”

It does not belong to the President of the US::: even if He's the most powerful person on earth to interfere in the pedagogy of University. He can help find more tuitions and scholarship. He can ask the help of our experts particularly regarded to the effective management of complex issues. He can help build US 21st century educational model but not to interfere in our domestic affairs. 2.3. However::: here is the fact! one of the goal of university is to help students socialize and integrate themselves. And INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS are kind of SPECIAL TOURISTS. They'll never discover the best of Harvard and America by staying at home 24/7. They need to connect themselves with our children and learn from America.

Anybody who has a brain knows this is true.,Tell your Police to arrest students who make death threats for speech .... I tried to contact that girl to tell her all lives matter and invited her to come stab me but no response .... Could Harvard rely the message to her .... I will be waiting ....,What?! Okay... The supremacist tone though.,AemmeAemmel HHk,AemmeAemmel HHk,Some police officers try hard to do better. It was a police officer who created the concept of Star Trek::: because they wanted to show a world where different people work together::: and that it was normal. So a police officer created Star Trek to show positive imagery. But then you hear stories from people on Juries that officer gets caught in a lie. A law firm did a study on bad cops and often found they where clinical psychopaths. That psychopaths look for police jobs because they can harm others and get away with it. That people actually use science and find problems and then here comes Harvard::: and not one bit of science. Where science should be about studying Star Trek's positive imagery.. so lets do a study::: take a sample of people and show one group a lot of positive imagery of race and mixed people working together::: and take the another group and show negative imagery::: and then the third group nature pictures. Then after the study::: make some sort of fake test::: but measure facial features if the test provider is white or black. Both being dressed the exact same. Its like liberal inquisitions have to be baby sitted and taught basic logic and reasoning skills::: and how to produce real science to get to the truth. No::: you have this political monster where if they think it they think its true. Liberals are displaying the worst form of reasoning skill::: and are just like Trump. But then they will come around and define a dictionary towards their word usage::: than criticize other areas mutation of English instead of being inclusive. You go to California and its nothing but Texas did this wrong::: and Texas did that wrong. Its like wow::: Texas has nothing to do with lazy liberals never investing in desalinization a lot of other countries have already found working solutions::: and then they can't even take the time to study trees thermal effects::: it actually stays cooler with just ground cover and no tree canopy::: the tree canopy trapping IR emissions is likely why the data is the way it is. They have to mix plants that adapted to have thermal reflecting coating into the forests. You just see this complete disregard for science in US politics. Its mind boggling. I suggest people do two things::: first take the time to read a mass media story and then contact the people in the story::: lot of times the mass media never contacted anyone in the story::: and it will often be so misconstrued. The other issue is do science for yourself::: take the time to collect measurements and data. A law firm did this and found the problem was psychopathic personalities using police job to cover that they want to hurt other people. Psychopathic personalities tend to be extremely intelligent::: and often practice lies::: so what ever rules they will just find a way to lie. The more the rules::: only those that know how to lie get past them. Overload on Data collection the data becomes hard to use.. Harvard could be doing real science and providing law enforcement offices tools to help evaluate personal better.,Is that for real?I heard Oxford and Cambridge always did it better in investigation.,Nancy Dry,😍,Mht Mêhèdí Hãsâñ,THANK YOU!,What do you suggest?,I am from Cape Town I Never believed i will ever get a final solution to my diabetes again. but Mama shamina has given me a reasons to be happy::: i was infected with diabetes for 2 years and all the means i tried for treatment was not helpful to me::: but when i came on the face book i saw great testimony about Mama shamina +27673785858 how she was able to help someone who was suffering from diabetes this person said great things about this woman::: and advice we contact her on (+27673785858) for any Disease problem that Mama shamina can be of help::: well i decided to give her a try::: she requested for my information which i sent to her::: and she told me she was going to prepare for me a healing portion::: which she wanted me to take for days::: and after which i should go back to the hospital for check up::: well after taking all the treatment sent to me by Mama shamina i went back to the Hospital for check up::: and now i have been confirmed free from diabetes::: Thanks Mama shamina [+27673785858] for your help.,Looking forward to your findings,ABOLISH HUPD.

"On Monday::: ICE announced that international students will not be allowed to stay in the country if they attend institutions::: like Harvard::: that are holding courses online this fall. Harvard and MIT have filed pleadings in the US District Court in Boston seeking a temporary restraining order prohibiting enforcement of the ICE order.

“As a university with a profound commitment to residential education::: we hope and intend to resume full in-person instruction as soon as it is safe and responsible to do so. But::: until that time comes::: we will not stand by to see our international students’ dreams extinguished by a deeply misguided order. We owe it to them to stand up and to fight—and we will.” – President Bacow

Supporting International Students | Harvard University",7/8/20 12:41,Remember all these international students have worked hard for it. Their parents have slogged for providing them this education as US education is the best in some fields. Some of them even sell their properties to educate their children.,Yeah lets pay $50k tuition a year for streaming virtual classes... they wouldnt need to sue if they did what some other schools have planned. Its laziness to go completely online and claim its for health and safety. But alas Harvard can take the potential hit from it,"All these is saying one thing::: ""build your economy and reform your educational system so that your students can study at the comfort of their national territory.""","Do anyone know if there is a page or group where I can find probably a current student majoring in Biology to tutor my son in “Introduction to molecular and cellular Biology”
He wasn’t expecting to be taking the class online and he is struggling. If someone can guide me I will truly appreciate it. Thanks in advance.",With international travel restrictions those students won’t be able to get to US anyway. How about you provide private jets as well? In my opinion online learning would be much easier and safer option.,Why don't you resume campus instruction in the fall with your students and professors wearing masks with increased disinfection like everyone else.,Where to send a supportive check?,I totally support Harvard in standing up for what is right. You are leading the way for what I am sure will be many suits for the freedom of educational institutions to protect their students...,Well why didn’t you think about them when you created your re-opening plan?,That's make it Harvard! Proud of my alma matter...,"You knew the rules when you made the decision to move to an online only format.

The rules have been relaxed to allow for hybrid online and in person classes. They are not more restrictive.

You should not be allowed to file this and waste taxpayers money when you made the decision to forego any real classes.

Your commitment to residential education is laughable. Your alumni who are applauding your posturing should ask for a tuition reimbursement::: as they are obviously uneducated.","Supporting International Students
So proud to be part of Harvard",Isn't it easier to provide hybrid solutions than to sue the govt. Something is up.,"To me::: this is absolutely hypocritical::: which is not really helping the students but a good showcase of the universities' political positions. I wrote an open letter to the president and wish they can take real action to help.

Why force students to pay for something they are not getting and not only that you raise tuition.,"Shame on you::: Harvard and Mit!! Can't believe you are this selfish::: put your own interests and ignore that of the nation and American citizens. Are you sure you are a non-profit organization? Or you are truly just another greedy business in the field of ""education""... ...",Is this the answer to Convid? Foreign students shall learn german and study here I think.,Harvard::: take a look at the way Smith College is handling this. It seems like a good compromise to me.,I'd like to remind you that it is not any new rule that one must leave the US with only online classes. What seems relevant to have in mind for your lawsuit::: is: a) the requirements for studentloan in one's homecountry b) any necessity for live interaction and feedback from professors and fellow students::: that might not be possible on a different timezone c) the allowing of 90 days stay after the visa is questioned,Apparently::: Harvard feels PROFIT is MORE IMPORTANT than the interests of AMERICAN CITIZENS.,your alumni stand by you!,"Though I'm not studying at harvard:::
But I felt grateful for the university.",Thank you for standing up for what is right. The ICE policy is blatantly racist and unsafe for students and faculty.,Can completely understand totally support Harvard.,Without international students USA will no longer be the most powerful economy . It’s international students and work force that has made America great .,You do not become the best by folding when the wind blows!,"I think every University nationwide needs to follow and file lawsuits against the administration.
Nothing. those students or their home country did created the predicament the U.S. is in.",When are you going to change the name of the University since Mr. Harvard was a slave owner?,That is Boston ::: my lovely city.,Thank you for standing up for your students against archaic rules from an archaic government.,I'm grateful that my alma mater took the lead!,Thank you::: but you can do more! Please consider a hybrid format for all classes. 10 people attend in person this week and the rest are on zoom or whatever platform you use. Next week a new set of 10 are in person and the rest are on zoom. And so on...you can decide on the exact number that is appropriate for physical distancing in the classroom. We cannot let this pandemic completely control us. There are plenty of ways to operate in a hybrid format that would allow for a better educational experience for ALL and allow our foreign students to remain in country.,Sounds like it was written by the Airline industries::: and probably turn right around and double the price of international flights.,This shows why Harvard and MITs are top institutions in the world!,I am very proud of Harvard and the MIT.,Great now use some of your best lawyers win the case,if they aren’t attending class in person they do not have a need to be in the country specifically if their health is at risk. Or::: Harvard can hold hybrid in person and online options.,Indeed::: Thank you for standing with International students::: residential education is key.,If US student are staying “home” while attending online classes then why wouldn’t foreign students “go home” during the same time? Especially if the true reason for them being in county is educational?,"Thanks mr bacow:::education
is the key to succes. Before this politians changed the padlocks in africa.",Way to go::: Harvard!,Thank you::: we couldn’t expect less from you,"Veritas ""Nothing But the Truth"" on wheels Bravo!",Harvard is known for it's greatness. Harvard always stands for justice.,"Campaign: VERITAS

To All People around the World.",Can you hold a five minute class on the yard a day? They show up at an appointed time every day and wave at their professor::: across the yard? Have them answer one question and ask one question. Class dismissed.,Where was this same energy when you told the same group of students they had 5 days to evacuate their dorms and find accommodation elsewhere::: at the start of the pandemic?,If worse comes to worse::: and if possible::: offer in-class at least one course for each International student in large halls (for safety and social distancing) where instructors and the other students attend virtually.,Proud of Harvard University for supporting it's international students!,That's a great stance.,Way to go::: we should support International Students. Focus on the issue.,Thanks for siding wth intl studnts,Forgive my typos I do not proof read and sometimes spell correct puts the wrong word in and sometimes it is my fat fingers hitting the wrong button,Proud of Harvard::: Happy Lawsuit! Best of luck!,Thanks for supporting them!,give the money back,Thanks::: Harvard and MIT!,Good olde Harvard!I wish to study at this highly prestigious institution!!!,Love is the unity of souls::: minds and bodies. Pay attention to the arrangement...🍀,The Best university in the world.,You guys have great legal minds::: lock this up until Biden takes over!,This is a disgrace. Good on you for standing up for your students.,I will no longer support this institution...,I guess it'll be one more step.,The Only reason you stand with them is because of the money the college makes from each international student,"Beautiful young wealth"" referendum""-fas
t system to unique humanities to love of christ""-() #coolseed# okay thanks to you""~",Anyone who believes that the colleges should file lawsuits against our government for the situation of the college who do you think is going to pay for it. It is called the American taxpayers who could use that money as a stimulus check rather than wasting it on law suits. Also. Their actions in filing a lawsuit or even complaining shows me that the colleges place their needs above the safety of those living in the US. There is a pandemic going on right now. And the spread of the virus is real. And no amount of money is worth the possible loss of life,"Too little too late. The Ivy League universities are complicit with this administration.
Shame on Harvard et al. for training our so called leaders so poorly.",Open 90%,Worry about LEGAL Americans first why don’t you.😡,Michael,Also who do you think is going to be the first ones to complained when they shut down the ability for the students from other countries to go home because the pandemic. In my opinion the Pandemic is only going to get worse and they are going to be stranded here complaining about being stranded here,This wasn't a rule just made up by Trump. In order to qualify for a student visa you need to be taking classes in person. If you aren't physically sitting in a class room you can take those classes from home::: just like US students will be.,Being a retired Operating Room Nurse and having a deep understanding of aseptic technique I believe there is a way to safely teach both the on line class and on campus at the same time it to stream the class by video cameras. To keep instructors safe have a back way in for instructors have student wear masks use hand sanitizer plus wipes in bathrooms have a plexiglass sheiks up between students and instructors seal up the room and add it’s own independent A/C creating positive pressure for the instructors.,why doesn't HARVARD DO THE RIGHT THING AND HAVE EVERYONE TESTED and if you chose to be online::: then reduce tuition fees since the students can't utilize the lab::: library::: sports::: etc. you have 80 billion in endowment do something you can do HYBRID TO KEEP STUDENTS THERE. CDC Recommends contract tracing and testing and keep people distant::: you can block out every other table::: split up classes and different start times. With fancy money you can create fancy ideas.,US Universities leaching off Foreign students. Deport.,Can’t be more proud of Harvard University for supporting it’s international students!!! Awesome job as always.,Screw YOU HARVARD. You have been harboring terrorists and spies for decades. If anything YOU SHOULD BE SHUT DOWN and your Professors arrested for giving aid to enemies. HOW IS THAT?!?!?!?!?!?,I am very proud of Harvard university great,"Good afternoon Harvard and MIT! Support American students and not international students. I see you're doing your part in maintaining your relationship with China. Harvard::: is this about the $1B you receive from China yearly? MIT::: what about your ties to Chinese AI companies that help the CCP enslave the Uyghur population?

All it is is a building! They are here to go to your building. If online is good enough for domestic students it is certainly good enough for your foreign ones. GET THEM OUT. TAKE SOME LIBERALS WITH YOU. 🌊💦😂💦🌊😂💦,"If you see Pakistani privileged students there ask them of Balochistan and if you get crap give this into their face . Pakistan is a Racist State ! That's very much open and obvious without an iota of doubt to me . As a responsible human being just analyze the facts . Here one can witness Pakistan's Human Rights Minister besides her own departments reports ::: recommendations
instead of condemning is sort of defying ::: defending injustice .

My dream is to study in America::: but the financial conditions do not allow me to study on my own account::: and Harvard University is one of the best universities in the world and I would like to get a fully funded scholarship for me to study BA and I am from the state of Libya in North Africa and the F1 visa is permitted for a study I hope you will read My message and to convey my message to the Harvard University administration together::: regards::: thanks.♥️♥️,"Just a follow -up on my post yesterday that I read this morning:
The defending champion Washington Nationals and reigning American League champion Houston Astros called off training camp practices after not receiving test results from Friday. The St. Louis Cardinals also scrubbed their scheduled workout for similar reasons.

My point is baseball compiled a 67- page safety guide by some very bright folks and having a plan is a must do. If I were an older professor or a student with preexisting conditions::: I would throw any plan out the window in trying to figure out a pandemic and how safe you really are. This is all about the school business making money::: nothing more.",So classes for the fall will be online. Homeschoolers 1::: Harvard 0.,"https://

Anyway::: just remember everyone..
#ALLLIVESMATTER","I‘d support it a lot to educate people more about awareness rather then statements from specialists.
For instance::: clearing it up for people how to remain during lockdowns.
What it means for the biology of our brain::: as well directly our well-being and state of health and ressistance towards diseases::: if one is under constant fear::: what can happen if masses of people are living without any sense of mindfulness. Maybe teaching methods to control your body more. Breathing technics etc.
To prevent the spread of a viral pathogen one can not just count on governmental actions like lockdowns.
I see no educational clearing towards the people from any institution except (at least not at Harvard but Cambridge) braging about vaccines that are completely mis-calculated and now being tested on African and Brazilian (poor) people what I see as a crime against those people using them like lab-mices!
The virus exists::: but if the numbers are really correct::: to become an actual epidemic or pandemic::: we can fall back on it‘s declarance:
„...exceptional
high rate of incubations and mortality...“ which are not given for this virus.
Compare it to the real numbers of patients fighting cancer or even having to rest in piece because if it?.... Then cancer is a far more dangerous disease then any virus or bacteriophage is at the moment. (Except an MDR-bacteriopha
ge will strike finally as expected one day. This will put any current virus into shadow....). Note: virus are not „alive“ as bacterias are...
We all know there are maaaany more people infected but nothing happening.
These numbers on medias contain nothing then a basic calculus. To really give a real number::: it needs differential equations::: like for „chaos-theory“:::
which will not result in round numbers.
The rate of failure from the testing methods are too high as a basic calculus would ever be correct as well there are too many vectors included that these numbers can be right.
Maybe for media::: economy and politicians it‘s enough. But for science it‘s not as we know.
Therefore again::: I support a more educational program towards the regular citizens::: to teach them that only a different behavior and mindfulness in all these things happening atm::: keep you more healthy then staying at home and hope nothing will happen to you. But if something happens there will be someone healing you::: which in any disease it‘s noone then you and your own body. You get a surgery? It‘s still you::: who has to be patient and wait for the healing-process
. Regardless of medications given. You have the flu? You have to be strong and stay positive so healing process can be processed with less ressistance from your neuro-biology.

You might want to ask Professor Pinker as a very impressive person or Professor Greenberg from Dpt. of Neurobiology at Harvard to help raising a bit more education for the people?
If I‘d work at Harvard I would fully commit my freetimes to do so without hesitation of 7/24 weeks.

VIRUSES ARE ""offshoots"" of life::: and::: literally::: trillions of years wouldn't be enough time for the sequence of molecules in the “simple” DNA/RNA of a virus to come into existence by chance. In fact::: DNA cannot come into existence without RNA and proteins. All three are mutually dependent. One cannot come into existence without the other two. The fact that some viruses have only DNA while others only have RNA is evidence that they are offshoots of living organisms::: which have both. A virus depends on a living organism to replicate::: further evidence that viruses are offshoots of living organisms::: not their precursors.

It's crazy how my daughter one month ago started a movement in Europe. She wrote to the government::: migration agencies::: student unions to work with the colleges. She has been on their news and radio stations and in the media. Now the college is doing half on line and campus which you should be doing so these students can use your facilities to make great art and not get deported. The University of Gothenberg in Sweden gave international fee paying students outside the European union a 1:::500 tuition reduction scholarship fund for this semester and is 4:::500 per semester for a political communications degree. students won't get deported and my daughter able to do this as a US citizen when no one else could and she is well driven person. Please get your priorities straight and do the right thing. Covid has no borders::: you just have to spread everyone out you have 80 billion dollars so put it for use for your students::: their school::: their future.

641691506705276/",Racism is an inescapable cycle because all sides are oppressed directly and indirectly. Black people are oppressed across the world::: whites are oppressed in the foreign areas::: Asians are oppressed too. So racism is a cycle that makes the world to operate in a difficult way. The main thing that keeps us to this cycle is the history::: we tend to focus more on history and end up adopting the superiority and inferiority complex that was on our forefathers. We focus too much on history than the future. Let's think of the coming generations::: they will learn history and have the same mentality. Let's learn history to understand our past and not learn it to destroy the future. The study of Harvard University on racism will show the different views of the international and local students and how Americans view this and also how Asians feel about it. Let's stop oppression people and let's stop allowing the past to rule us.

The questions I ask are like If X is the set of learning algorithm and Y is set of theory that applies to each member x in X::: and if the definition of learning algorithm is broad enough to include all human brains then y in Y applies to all humans. Still wordy::: takes awhile to condense information into easy to read format. One y could be the need for robust data sets::: meaning humans need to encounter diversity and travel to different systems to expand their mind to see better choices::: because this is how humans encounter vast variations in input data lines. (Einstein's childhood had a lot of travel::: as well as Florence Nightingale) Last part of the theory would actually assigning metrics to test predictions against real world data. The framework while it can make better Ai::: should also tell exactly where humans can do better in education or what they are doing right in education. :-p,"THE RESULTS WOULD BE SQUASHED IF PPL COULD USE BTC::: PPL AREN'T INTERESTED IN RACISM TBH::: PPL JUST WANT ENOUGH TO LIVE A HAPPY LIFE::: AND IF THEY HAD ENOUGH BTC THEY WOULD FEEL BETTER::: AND THEY WOULD HAVE NO ANIMOSITY TOWARDS THAT SATOSHI NAKAMOTO -\-\-\-\ HONESTLY HARVARD IS KIND OF SETTING ITSELF UP FOR A HUGE RACIAL SLUR::: OBVIOUSLY THEY DON'T KNOW IT YET::: JUST THE WAY IT IS.

According to the guarantor::: they are of special importance even for the present...",99+ percent of history has been forgotten so forgetting the history of racism and genocide that is an unfortunate part of America is in the main good. Just more history unremembered - the best revenge against vile folks::: to forget they existed. So tear them down.,It is not by removing statues or vandalizing and lifting shops and public buildings::: or banning classics like Gone with the Wind::: that history will be wiped out. Slavery is a part of our history::: that we have to accept and to move on together into a better future.,That is how fascism begins.,it’s just like burning books,Statues are a constant reminder of the horrors experienced::: do you want people to forget about the deaths suffered by freedom? Removing the statue is not only saying that it did not happen there::: but also removing the entire struggle against oppression and tyranny. But as far as I know::: I'm just an Italian descendant of a family that survived the Mussolini trial.,Why the statue was placed there is an opinion::: and the Historian in the article is very opinionated and assumes they were placed for the worst reason. The reality is after thinking about it::: that they were likely war memorials for the 258:::000+ southerns that died in the civil war. Isn't the problem with Racism to begin with is people assuming the worst in other people to begin with. Racism is wrong::: and that is easily proven in terms of measurements::: and when you go to judge people which everyone has to do::: skin color has no proof of being a valid metric. Recent debates all I see is people assuming the worst in others. Liberal inquisition is often quick to jump to calling names than thinking. The reality is these people that put up the statues also created the Democratic party::: that behaviors where in conflict with Jesus::: and had to give up hate to get right with God. If you went back to 1910s and told a black woman Historian that 90%+ of blacks would be voting for democrats they would think the devil possessed them. Its the democrats who are giving themselves in this past decade 0% interest loans to build apartments for blacks instead of giving them the loans to choose their own housing. Blacks wouldn't be building such ugly appartments with that money::: and they would be putting landscape and solar panels::: and that is the truth. Its also the democrat party pushing the idea of Abortion in black communities::: that has killed over a million unborn blacks. Its also under local democrat leadership why diabetes is 5 to 9% of all blacks in the US to be in poverty. Why for 30 or 40 years were health and wellness investments not being put in black communities. I kind of see that these civil war memorials as a distraction to the real questions that need to be asked::: and why blacks have had democrat leaders for decade after decade::: and they seem to ignore the black community right after election day. They need to pay in advance for black votes in my opinion::: instead of making urban habitat that stuffs them in apartments. Blacks should tear down their appartments so their not modern surfs to make room for black home ownership.,"The NYPost just said they are coming for Jesus statues....this

No one puts a monument up to Washington or Jefferson to promote slavery. The monuments go up because::: without Washington::: there likely would not have been an American nation. They put up monuments to T.J. because of the Declaration of Independence::: which every group has used to make their place in American society.”,“Every record has been destroyed or falsified::: every book rewritten::: every picture has been repainted::: every statue and street building has been renamed::: every date has been altered.

The 34-page study packs into its economical format details of what will be historical surprises to most readers. It reports that three Harvard presidents owned slaves; that slaves worked on campus as early as 1639; that among the first residents of Wadsworth House (built in 1726) were two slaves::: Titus and Venus; that slave labor often underwrote the success of Harvard’s early private benefactors; and that the connection between College donations and slave-related industries persisted until the Civil War.",I'll visit you one day,"If this is the product that Harvard proudly graduates::: shut the doors and turn off the lights.

WHAT DID THE German Shepherd say to the bulldog? The German Shepherd said ""You're not a dog because you don't look like me. You look like a cat! Hey::: is that your nose or your mouth? HA::: HA! How can anything that looks like you have the soul of a dog? You don't belong here. Get out of this neighborhood::: NOW!!""",The only place in the science where you find freedom::: democracy and justice is your home only among your family,💖,"25 to 50% of police killings are untreated mentally ill. The data online says 2 per 1 million blacks will die each year from police. Where 6 to 9% of the entire black population is thought to be in poverty just because of diabetes which can be 20% of the entire population that is black medical expenses. The US 250:::000 per year will die because of medical errors::: twice as many people then that died of covid-19 in 6 months. Harvard is in large part to blame::: not the head of the medical school who understands::: but US medical care is incredible bias prone methodology::: and Harvard isn't really team smart enough to know how to fix it. In large part because it requires physics::: computer science algorithms::: statistical theoretic. Put this all together and you have a device that can take a lot of measurements that can be data mined. ASU did great by doing just a tiny sample of data for parkinson's. Not only did objective data mining spot parkinson's 2 years before a medical doctor could::: it did it at a much higher accuracy rate. That was just off of voice data. In a pandemic like COVID-19 the voice data did so well with Parkinson which is associated with the Vagus nerve it may also spot the Thymis gland activating (which produces the B-cells). So when 25 to 50% of police killings are of untreated mentally illness::: its hard not to notice that fields medical research often has sample sizes of 10::: and a horrible horrible psychoanalyst methodology which is not real science. You take Physics and engineer ways to collect massive amounts of infomatiks being put out by the body. Then you get these people with problems and you start data recording::: and then looking for patterns. US Health fraud in the area says all the theory lays on controlling neurotransmitte
r.. however medical facts show a lot of the symptoms of mental illnesses can be caused by other parts of the body. Such as cyst on the Adrenal Gland::: which is made of modified nerve cells (which is probably why diabetes causation is so common with mental health medications::: because they can't even understand its likely screwing with the adrenal gland) . The lack of amino acid which is the precusor to neuro transmitters::: and this could be wide range from ADHD to what ever else.. When the methodology of data science is done correctly in this field of medicine then the causation can be differentiated:::
and treatments can be highly accurate. The average for example of a patient misdiagnosed with schizophrenia is 10 years to find the error. By that time its likely the medications gave them diabetes (or big boobs according to that lawsuit commercial). More or less::: its a serious human rights violation perpetuated by schools like Harvard who turn a blind eye to the poor methodology. US health care is like 65% subjective and only 35% objective. Its why 250:::000 Americans per year die because of medical error. Twice as many that has died so far because of covid-19. In fact::: the error rate is so high::: more people maybe dying from medical errors from access to US health care than died from lack of health insurance before obamacare. Health care accessibility is a good thing::: it just to highlight that the error rate is so high that it looks like more people died because of access.",When did Harvard become a far left propaganda machine!,Domestic Violence been linked to 10+ drop in average IQ. Lead can cause 6+ drop in average IQ. Lack of food in kids can permanently shut down certain brain functions. Violance for children the body is going to respond by hardening the skull::: which keeps the brain mass down. When a child isn't given enough food the body will partition resources to vital functions. When lead or other drugs enter the brain it causes synapses to change which rewires normal parts of brain functions over time. So this study is interesting because its another aspect::: because emotional responses of fear or what ever else::: could cause restructuring in the brain.,what about trauma from criminal activity in those areas?,Ana Clara Buquetti,So how us coming from dictatorship and civil war progresses in this world!!! Please stop the absurdity! The police authority is crucial in every country but if you love anarchism and violence police is not need it. I will tell Harvard that cost an arm and a leg to spend the money of the tuition for better research. Study the violence inside of the family in these communities or the fact of missing the figure of father or mother. Please do a research about depression in kids from immigrated families where the kids see their parents in their dreams because the work more than 14 hours a day.,Ekaterina Kipiani,#AllLivesMatter,so abolish HUPD::: lol,Guess white people are unaffected when white people are killed by police. Harvard is bigoted.,This is such a bunch of BS.,Bill Bong,You can look at it in a way to Europe..👀,Why don’t we use streaming networked police cameras for oversight and prevent problems like walking into a trap or calling for reinforcements measures?,"Anyone living near ANY killing ::: whether justified or not suffers trauma. The killing in these riots affected all. Policemen/
women are 18 times more frequently killed than civilians. Guess what color my skin is? One human race. Deal with it. I do not feel anyone of a different color than I should feel guilty unless they directly hurt me or mine.",The American idea of policing consists of wielding authority to protect a system that serves and protects a white upper class::: and suppressing anything that remotely threatens it.

ce",All lives matter CLAIRIA janover,Great,I theorize that there is a as of yet discussed phenomenon::: that I refer to as time atmospheres. In which the gravity of an object may affect the passage of time. Time passes at the rate it does due::: in large::: to the field of gravity it is passing through. Currently we are on earth::: we experience time at a specific rate. When we leave earth::: there is a difference in two clocks set at the exact same time...this is documented. At the same time deep space is very cold::: with particles and atoms moving at extremely slow rates. Due in part to temperature::: I theorize this is also in part due to another influence. Like atmospheres in the ocean::: the deeper you go the more pressure there is. Picture that in reverse. The closer you are to a gravitational source::: the greater the effect of time is felt. The further you get away from the source of gravity the less effect it has. Therefore if my theory is correct::: deep space is A) not as old as we think it is::: and B) time everywhere in the universe is operating at different rates. While they still follow relativity theory::: they are in different environments. I would match this with several lakes::: each with different depths. The pressure from each works on all the same principals::: but each is at a different stage. I believe ::: a complete guess at this point::: that dark energy/matter etc::: could be explained by this theory as the interaction between different time atmospheres::: a bit like currents in the ocean being affected by temperature::: but in this case its gravity::: not temperature causing the currents.,Why is your professor Priyamvada Gopal stating that “White lives don’t matter” and that we need to “abolish Whiteness”?,These pharma demonic labs create evil concoctions.,Loma Omar,"https://

VIRUSES ARE ""offshoots"" of life::: and::: literally::: trillions of years wouldn't be enough time for the sequence of molecules in the “simple” DNA/RNA of a virus to come into existence by chance. In fact::: DNA cannot come into existence without RNA and proteins. All three are mutually dependent. One cannot come into existence without the other two. The fact that some viruses have only DNA while others only have RNA is evidence that they are offshoots of living organisms::: which have both.

What happens inside the black hole? How a black hole loses mass and becomes a star again.with Evidence. 🌀
The black hole which is the most mysterious object in this universe because nothing comes out of it. While it may seem impossible to know what happens inside a black hole::: in reality it is possible to know. There is only one way to know this.This time I will show the unseen Although it seems impossible to know what happens to matter in a black hole::: it is nature makes that impossible possible. Black holes bring out the contents of black holes. Just like cutting with a fork. The special time occurs when two black holes merge into one. However::: that special time is not always created. Matter comes out of the black hole according to a rule.We need to know that. Since the matter of the black hole will come out through the black hole::: it means that there will be at least two black holes. One will be much more massive like Supermassive and the opposite will be nearly massive like 10-40 times more massive than the Sun (no problem if you add and subtract some mass).
Supermassive blackhole that controls everything in a galaxy. Any other object in the galaxy is insignificant to Gravity. When small blackhole as like stellar mass get too close to the attraction of a supermassive black hole::: the matter in the stellar black hole is forced to come out. Because this is the gravity of a stellar black hole is losed to the extreme gravity of a supermassive black hole::: and the geometric structure of space-time also contributes to this. As a result::: matter slowly comes out of the surface of the stellar black hole. Because this is the attraction of supermassive black holes works better on the surface of stellar black holes. That matter will slowly take the form of a cloud of gas and dust but that cloud of gas and dust will be as heavy as a star. That matter exits before the supermassive black hole enters the accretion disk. At one point::: the mass of the stellar black hole gradually decreases as matter continues to emerge. As a result::: the event Horizon and the singularity of the stellar black hole is gradually destroyed. At one stage everything is visible.This process can take up to a thousand years::: and its orbit is much older. ★ The latest black hole loses its mass and reaches a point where it becomes a star again. Hey::: you read that::: it is possible to make a black hole from a star and a star from a black hole but that star is somewhat like the Star of the early Universe. This is one of the reasons why the area around the center of each galaxy is illuminated. However::: black holes that move very fast and have a lot of mass will merge directly with the supermassive black hole without losing mass.This is the only way to get to know the black hole in its entirety & as well as objects like the Great Attractor can also cooperate . When the James Webb space telescope starts its work::: we will see the matter of the black hole.
There are two types of black hole collide.1) Gravitational waves are created as a result of the union of two black holes.There is not much difference in their mass. When they meet::: no matter comes out. 2) In this case::: no gravitational waves are created as a result of the union of two black holes. Because the matter of as like stellar black hole is stolen by big black hole. Small energy is defeated by big energy. At one point the small black hole loses its unstable. Moreover::: another reason is that the stellar revolves around the big one.
Evidence:★
a) The proof is in our galaxy. The G-type objects found around Sagittarius A * look a nearly like clouds of gas and dust::: but their density is like a star.They are the matter of a destroyed black hole. This is why G-type objects are close to Sagittarius A *::: but are not able to stretch as much as vermicelli due to the force of gravity.From the matter of a single black hole at one stage so many dense objects can be created.b)The low-mass black holes that orbit Sagittarius A * in elliptical orbits::: when the Sagittarius A * moves closest to it::: the normal shape of the black hole is lost due to intense one stage the shape becomes oblong. Then matter comes out.If a lot of matter comes out at once and the orbital speed is high::: then that matter will continue to orbit the super massive black hole in a new orbit. And if little matter comes out::: it will turn into food.c) When the matter of a star enters the Accretion disk then it bright But it is many times brighter than when enters the BlackHole matter of a Accretion disk. Moreover::: when many many large massive black holes enter the Accretion disk at the same time there is a possibility of formation of Relativitie Jets & several large black hole enter the disk then emanating bubbles made solely powerful gamma rays.

[4] There is massive government surveillance of everybody. For example::: even before the Trump supporter and Facebook board member Peter Thiel became the first investor in Facebook::: he cofounded Palantir Technologies which spies on everyone.
[5] We have a rigged and mainly 2 party system in which corporate lobbyists tell the Congress how to write the bills and then tell the Congress which way to vote::: or else the corporations will not fund the (re)election campaigns.

Corona virus treatment is available but we are using the wrong way to use it:::
I will explain to you the correct method that can be used with the patient for only ten days and then the error. Corona virus infects some cells and then passes to another::: and we will use two things in treatment
They are hydroxychloroqu
ine and blood plasma together
1_ hydroxychloroqu
ine prevents the virus from binding to the cell wall::: so we will use it to prevent further spreadThus::: we can block the infected cells.
2- We use blood plasma to treat infected cells.
Meaning that we can summarize this relationship that the more a person has a disease::: the less use of hydroxychloroqu
ine and the greater the use of blood plasma::: and vice versa.
While the wrong way is to use hydroxychloroqu
ine with all cases::: I challenge any doctor to answer and explain this in detail and this is my email address: goda44154@gmil.

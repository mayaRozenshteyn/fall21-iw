Meet Jasmine Gonzalez & Juliana Lamm-Perez::: #Stanford2025 🗳  Jasmine (left): I was born in San Rafael::: which is a town in Marin County::: on the other side of the Golden Gate Bridge. I went to middle school there::: and then I went to high school in San Francisco. My brother and I actually went to rival high schools. We'd have a basketball game where both teams were playing::: girls and boys … it was interesting having my parents cheering for both.  Juliana: I was born in Boston::: but I moved to San Francisco when I was four. So::: I've been there my whole life. I spent half of my childhood living with my grandparents::: which was really nice. I grew up mostly in the Richmond district.  Jasmine: I chose Stanford because I think the community is just really beautiful. It seems so open. The weather's amazing. It's close enough to home that I can always visit if I need to::: but it's far enough away that I'm kind of living a separate life. And of course the academics are wonderful.  Juliana: It’s a friendly environment::: social::: collaborative. And the D1 sports are pretty cool.  Jasmine: I would love to major in economics::: and I think I want to do a co-term in management science and engineering. I'm super excited to take this chemistry of cooking class in winter quarter. It's an IntroSem and it looks phenomenal. Apparently you cook in every class.  Juliana: I’m considering majoring in political science. After the 2016 election::: I got really interested in politics and campaigning. I listened to this one podcast over the pandemic::: about the Supreme Court and different landmark cases that aren't necessarily well known but have changed the face of politics. That was absolutely fascinating to me.  Jasmine: It’s really fun to be around all my classmates. It's a little overwhelming meeting so many people because my high school was only 100 people per grade::: but it's kind of exciting.  Juliana: It's only my second day here::: but I'm really excited to meet everyone::: make a lot of friends::: learn a lot.  📸: Andrew Brodhead,2021-09-27 19:17:25,Good luck::: ladies! Have a wonderful time!,Jasmine:::I did the opposite! I lived in San Francisco but went to high school in San Rafael.,Good luck::: ladies.,Amazing people at an awesome school 😍,Really Wish I could study for just a year at stanford,Future schoolmates cutie😊,When are you opening application for PhD History::: please?,wish you the best ladies💐,Best wishes,White dress is really more beautiful,Afternoon,Interesting students,can i get admission in bechlour?,Have an amazing experience!,Juliana::: are you married?

"Meet Maryam Khalil::: ’23::: and Imaan Ibrahim and Tori Hoge::: #Stanford2025 ⛲️  Maryam (left): I'm from Lee’s Summit::: Missouri and Misrata::: Libya. I was born in the States::: and I've spent my entire life back and forth between the two. I think I’ve learned a lot about how to navigate conversations with people who don't understand your identity::: don't understand your opinions::: don't understand where you've come from. But I like that I'm from Missouri. It's built a lot of who I am.  Tori (right): I'm from Thousand Oaks::: California::: which is about 45 minutes outside of LA. It's very sunny::: very beachy.  Imaan: I'm from Orange County. I have two siblings and we're ethnically from Sierra Leone::: but we've lived in Orange County our whole lives.  Maryam: I’m an RA in Larkin. It's super exciting to be welcoming freshmen to campus. But it’s funny::: because they think we (juniors) should know things. And we're like::: ""What do we know? We’ve only had two official quarters on campus.” But I feel like I wouldn't be the person I am without having had that space from Stanford::: being able to be alone in ways and think about why I’m doing what I’m doing.  Tori: Dorm staff is super encouraging::: funny::: helpful. It's not a condescending vibe. It's more like::: “I’m on the same level as you::: I relate to you::: you relate to me and we can have open conversations about anything.” They’re here to make connections and get to know us and help out.  Imaan: It's been really amazing and accepting.  Tori: Maryam promised us that she was going to take us fountain hopping at some point. So it was literally the second day here::: and we were going down the halls with a speaker just yelling at people::: ""If anyone wants to come::: meet in the lounge!"" And then we just gathered a big ol' group. None of us knew anyone::: and we ended up going to a bunch of different fountains.  Maryam: I feel like the freshmen this year are much more okay with—I don't know how to say it. They're just happy to be together. The pandemic has made that more of a thing::: where we are just super::: super happy to be around other people::: holding space together. It's just about having human connection.  I'm so excited to be able to go to actual in-person events::: like the Arab Spring Fair. And also reuniting with my friends. It's so nice to see people after a year and a half away.  📸: Andrew Brodhead",2021-09-22 17:22:40,Oh hey there Maryam Khalil 👋🏽,👏👏👏,Jenny KC,Enjoying these student profiles so much.

Last week::: Stanford welcomed 2:::131 first-year and 66 transfer students to campus—the largest incoming undergraduate class in school history. #Stanford2025,2021-09-20 18:29:05
Meet Julia Kao-Sowa::: #Stanford2025::: and Alawab Aldulimy::: ‘24 🏕  Julia: I'm from Northern Virginia. I kind of miss it::: but I'm really excited to live in California. I have two older brothers. The oldest one actually graduated from Stanford a little bit ago. My parents really support me. That's why I'm here.  Alawab: I was on campus last year and I met a few of my friends in our dorm. But for the most part::: most of the students that were in my classes::: I haven't met them yet.  Julia: We just go back from SPOT::: our pre-orientation trip where we go camping with a bunch of new freshmen. We went to Point Reyes. It was one of the best experiences ever. I was able to get really close to a lot of new people::: which was really amazing.  Alawab: Each group had two leaders. (I was one.) The whole idea was to bring this random group of strangers together. At first::: people were shy. So my other co-lead and I::: we had to facilitate things. But then the group came together. They shared a lot of their pandemic experiences. They bonded over all these strange things that we never saw coming. Then they got each other's numbers and now they're staying in touch. We said goodbye just a few minutes ago.  Julia: I chose Stanford for so many reasons. First of all::: it's really good for bioengineering. The weather's obviously great. And the people here are just so incredibly smart::: but also supportive at the same time.  Alawab: Being on campus right now is unimaginable. It's a wonderful experience to see students and bikes everywhere::: parents walking their freshman students in to their dorms. Last year::: I got used to seeing the streets here empty and all the buildings closed. Now I see them all open again::: and people sitting down. It just feels like campus is back. It's alive again.  Julia: It's just so crazy to actually be here::: to think this is my home. I'm looking forward to taking a lot of basic engineering courses::: getting a good foundation::: and also exploring cool classes. There's one on sea kayaking and there's one on marine biology that I'm really excited about. I'm just super excited to meet everyone and start on the next four years.  📸: Andrew Brodhead,2021-09-20 18:04:04,This was my son’s SPOT group! He had a blast. He told me the trip was the best time he ever had in his life. ❤️,Good Morning Guys! have a wonderful time with lots of love for your assignments 🌿🌿🌿,Congratulations,Hi!

Meet Leo Andrade and Spencer Wallace::: #Stanford2025 ⚽️⏰  Leo (left): I'm from the Central Valley::: from a city between Bakersfield and Fresno. My parents immigrated from Mexico before I was born. I have two younger brothers. My mom is a housewife. My dad works in agriculture::: driving citrus to the packing houses. My family is close::: mainly because we don't have any family nearby.  Spencer: I’m from Brentwood::: California. I have an older sister and a younger sister. My family's really into building stuff::: so growing up I built carts::: tricycles and sailing vehicles. We did Odyssey of the Mind::: which is a building competition where teams complete a set of tasks and problems while performing a skit.  Leo: One thing I brought with me to campus is a soccer scarf from my high school team. And a plush from a friend that represents the start of our friendship.  Spencer: I brought this digital clock I made with my uncle. It's got seven segment displays::: an internal crystal oscillator and binary counters inside. It displays seconds::: hours::: and minutes. It's really steampunk-esque. Reminds me of my family.  Leo: I chose Stanford because of the community. Everyone is super friendly and many distinct backgrounds are linked together here::: and they mingle really well. Also::: I'm from a low-income family. So Stanford really helped me with financial aid. Other universities offered financial packages::: but they weren’t as good.  Spencer: This fall::: I'm taking CS 106B along with CS 106M::: which is like the add-on class for CS 106B. I'm really interested in computer science::: so I want to get my hands dirty immediately. Eventually::: I'm interested in making more democratic workplaces where workers have more of a say in what they do and how much they're paid.  Leo: I'm looking forward to trying out club volleyball and the chess club. I've been playing chess for a while now::: but I took a break from it because of COVID. In the next four years::: I want to grow as a person here. I want to meet new people and I want to learn multiple perspectives in order to get a full understanding of serious issues.  📸: Andrew Brodhead,2021-09-17 18:56:27,I've been interviewing Stanford applicants through the OVAL program the past three years and it has been sobering to see how many very qualified young people do not get in.

"Meet Naima Patel::: #Stanford2025 🌴  From: I grew up in Kansas. It's been interesting navigating that with Indian roots::: but I had a great childhood. My parents are super supportive. They're here with me.  Brought from home: A lot of idols. We're Hindu::: so a lot of idols that my mom used to pray with.  Being on campus: It's unreal. I took a gap year::: and I never was able to visit because I saved all my college visits for admit weekends and that all got canceled. So it's kind of been two years in the making. It's a dream come true.  Chose Stanford because: Lots of things. The weather. Being close to Silicon Valley is obviously huge. And I really want to be in California in general and especially because I'm doing STEM and environmental stuff. And I'm obsessed with palm trees. I was like::: ""How can I be sad if I'm surrounded by palm trees?""  Considering majoring in: Environmental engineering::: minoring in gender studies.  Looking forward to: I'm cheering this year::: so games::: for sure.  Goals: Definitely just trying to find a home here::: make this place feel like home.

Stanford emeritus professor Albert “Al” Bandura::: a giant in the field of psychology who revealed the importance of observing and modeling behaviors::: has died at 95.  Bandura is best known for developing social cognitive theory; the concept of self-efficacy – the idea that a person’s belief in their ability to succeed can shape how they think::: act and feel; and his 1960s Bobo Doll experiments::: which demonstrated that children learn from watching adults and suggested that televised violence can teach and glamorize aggressive behavior. His social modeling work upended established doctrine that learning was a conditioned response to external punishments and rewards and led the Federal Trade Commission to pass new standards for televised advertising.  Before Bandura’s research::: “most work in social development was about reinforcement learning or about direct socialization – what adults did to children to shape them:::” Prof. Carol Dweck says. “Al’s work made children active seekers of learning and showed that children actively observe the world and make inferences that guide their future behavior. This was a real turning point – and we are still reaping the benefits of his insights today.”  Bandura was awarded the National Medal of Science by President Barack Obama in 2016. But he said of all his achievements::: he was most proud of the “knowledge and guidance he passed on to students.”  He is remembered across campus for inspiring others to believe in themselves and their work::: and for his faith in young people.  “As he would often say:::” Karen Saltzman::: Bandura’s assistant for the last 10 years of his life::: recalls: “‘Onward and upward and let the efficacy force be with you.’”  🗞: https://stanford.io/3xcNPUg 📸: Chuck Painter::: 1973,2021-07-30 21:43:30,His work influenced my love of understanding human behavior and has shaped the field as a whole. His work will live on indefinitely. Condolences to his family as they navigate their loss.,"Professor Bandura took the time to meet with me several times when I was an undergraduate. He was so thoughtful and helpful and insightful. I'll never forget him saying ""now THAT is your real laugh! That earlier one was your polite but fake laugh. You don't need to do that with me.""",Thank you::: Professor Bandura::: for inspiring generations of psychology students - myself included! Your work changed the landscape of developmental psychology.,Another one of my Stanford professors has passed… it was really an awesome time to be taught by leaders in their profession!,A wonderful teacher…he encouraged me to go on to graduate school. Condolences to his family and friends,Professor Bandura's work was foundational to my commitment to education::: social justice::: and what I do today. One of the highest privileges of being a psych major at Stanford was being able to take a seminar with him and 5 other students. At the time::: I heard that he was the most cited researcher in psychology. I don't know if that was true or not::: but I remember feeling both lucky and intimidated. He turned out to me a gentle teacher. RIP::: Professor.,He came to our prosem class (the cohort course for PhD students in education) invited by Paulo and Candence.

Stanford classmates Sammy Potter and Jackson Parell::: ‘22::: are attempting a feat only nine people are known to have accomplished: hiking the Pacific Crest::: Appalachian and Continental Divide trails in a single calendar year.  Averaging a marathon per day::: they’ve covered nearly 2:::500 miles since Jan. 1—close to a third of the roughly 8:::000-mile trek::: which involves 2.66 million feet of elevation change (the equivalent of scaling Everest from sea level about 100 times) and travel across 22 states.  “I know a lot of people that are frantic about making sure that every course::: every extracurricular::: every summer opportunity lines up perfectly to get them where they want to go at the end of their four years in college:::” Parell says. “But no one is one dimensional. Stanford has given me the freedom and the opportunity to explore other passions. And I know they’ll remain with me for the rest of my life.”  🗞: https://stanford.io/2QK8oYX,2021-04-29 21:00:18,Outstanding adventure! Congrats::: lads!,You have our prayers and spiritual support.

Wrestling is one of the lowest cost sports to maintain and you just had SIX guys nationally ranked and the team ranked # FIFTEEN in the nation. Multiple wrestlers that have been competing on US world (Olympic) teams. This makes NO sense. Right now women's wrestling is one of the fastest growing sports in the country and the Western States Championships coming up in Utah sold out in like 2 weeks. Come on what is the justification for dropping wrestling it wasn't listed in any of the bullet points.,Totally unethical move by Stanford with almost unfathomable timing. Sickening.,Awful::: infuriating::: and::: frankly::: embarrassing.  You’re cutting some national championship-wi nning programs with incredible histories of success.  I take great pride in being an alumnus from the only “academically elite” (for lack of a better term) school in the country to field so many exceptional::: national championship-le vel sports. With the reduction of a ton of those sports that is no longer the reality.  So disheartening and disappointing.,So sad.

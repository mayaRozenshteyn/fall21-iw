Many times over the years since her retirement::: upon hearing that Duke had tried something ""new"" in student housing::: she would say: ""Yeah::: we tried that back in the ____ (ex. ""late '70's"")... it didn't work then either."" If she were still with us (she passed in 2018 at 94)::: she would surely have something to say about this time too.",I was there!

It’s tiring and thankless::: but days like this make it all worthwhile. Thank you!,Go Duke Blue Devils,🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽,Thank God! And My::: God! How many innocent people are in prison?!,👏🏾👏🏾🙏🏾,God is good. Thanks Duke.,So happy to be affiliated with Duke and the work being done to protect the unjustly convicted. So many more innocent men and women are are incarcerated and need assistance like this. I would encourage everyone to donate to the Innocence Project::: Equal Justice Initiative::: or Duke’s program. The guilty should pay a penalty for their crimes::: but we have done a miserable job as a country at adjudicating thousands of cases where racial bias and other issues has led to unjust convictions. Our “justice” system is not just. We need reforms from the bottom up. I hope Duke can play a role in making that change occur.,Duke is a society of hypocrites who harbor jealousy and hate about scholarships and condone blackmail. They believe that as long as they harbor talented minds they shouldn’t be accountable for any harm. I am a relative of someone who went to Duke and I believe they need to make a privacy rule about people on campus discussing or debating anything that pertains to an individual’s family. If you are at a university you should be able to understand that it is inappropriate and out of line to discuss a student’s family member when they are on campus. That is why every adult that visits or attends campus should have to sign a form about right to privacy of relatives of students and persons under 18. It should be just like the dmv. If they won’t sign::: no enrollment.,❤️,Doing great things Duke Law School 🙏,Thank you Jesus.,Nicole Ann,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TODAY.DUKE.EDU Duke Listed Among Top Five Universities in WSJ/Times Higher Education National Ranking,2021-09-28 15:35:01,Duke is extraordinary. My son is a senior there and I could not be more proud. Thank you Duke for providing him the best experience,Rightfully deserved Duke University 💙!,Go Duke !,💙💙💙💙,Love working here! So proud of both university and medical center.,Incredible! It makes no sense. Duke is a 3 year university.,💙💙💙,💙💙💙,💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙,Congratulations 👏 🎊 💐,"FAILURE TO DIAGNOSE WITH A NEGATIVE OUTCOME.  Update: Thanks to the Dr. failing to perform an MRI when he was supposed to::: I now have a 25% chance of survival after 5 years. I've undergone radiation and now the cancer drugs leave me tired::: all the time.  I still have a recording of the cancer center PA telling me::: ""I don't know why the Dr. Does what he does::: but he absolutely was supposed to do an MRI after the first visit."" This Dr. took a shortcut and cost me the last 20 years of my life.  There's no accountability at duke. They simply pass the buck to the legal department and start lying.  On 11/5/19::: I was informed by a PA in the Duke Cancer Clinic that my doctor had failed to perform an MRI in a timely manner and due to this::: my cancer has spread from my prostate bed and I will now need radiation treatments. These radiation treatments will cause missed time from work and will result in the loss of my ability to earn income::: perhaps permanently::: and will almost certainly leave me impotent::: and with incontinence problems.  The PA twice told me that the doctor should have performed an MRI after our first meeting and should not have delayed the MRI for 6 months::: as he did. The PA stated:::""sometim es::: I don't know why he does what he does::: but he should not have put off the MRI."" As a result of the MRI being delayed by 6 months::: the cancer has spread. Had the MRI been done promptly::: the lesions would have been found and the operation would have been scheduled and the operation would have left me cancer free.  When I presented at Duke::: I informed Dr. Polascik that my Urologist had discovered cancer in my prostate and had recommended that I have the prostate removed in a timely manner. I was told by Dr. Polascik that that was “old thinking” and that I was “not a candidate for surgery.” Near the end of that appointment::: I again asked the doctor why my Urologist would recommend removal of the prostate while he believed that I was not a candidate for surgery. The doctor replied::: “did he really tell you that?” I again confirmed that this was the recommendation. I again was told that::: “that was old thinking and that I needed to come back in 6 months.” I was told that I have the “exact same cancer that virtually every man in his eighties has in his prostate::: only a lot less of it.” I was they would “do an MRI in six months to see if they could see anything” After the MRI::: I discovered that that I actually had two lesions on the outside of my prostate. The after-surgery report showed the cancer had spread into the prostate bed. Had the MRI been done after the initial visit::: which the PA twice informed me was what was supposed to happen::: the cancer would not have spread. I HAVE A RECORDING OF THE P.A. TELLING ME THIS.  Additionally::: they failed to treat my severe pain for four hours after surgery. They failed to use the spirometer after surgery. They sent me home without adequate pain meds and told me to call the nurses line if I needed them. When I called I was told they would be called in within 15 minutes. It actually took 6 hours and 10 calls to get them to finally call in the meds. When I asked the nurse why I was getting such terrible service::: she hung up on me. And no::: I do not have a history of opioid abuse.  They are overbooked. Too many patients::: and when you slip through the cracks and file a complaint::: they don't respond to the complaint.  Do yourself a favor::: choose a hospital and doctor that puts the patient before profits. Their failure to perform an MRI has ruined my future.  You shouldn't come away from an experience like this needing a medical malpractice attorney.",Go Duke.!!

Happy first day of fall 🍂,2021-09-22 14:21:58,But I miss you most of all::: my darling::: when the autumn leaves start to fall…💙,cute,cute,Best campus I've visited in the US!,M'sila university https:// www.univ-msila.d z/ wish good day,"Thanks to the Dr. failing to perform an MRI when he was supposed to::: I now have a 25% chance of survival after 5 years. I've undergone radiation and now the cancer drugs leave me tired::: all the time.  I still have a recording of the cancer center PA telling me::: ""I don't know why the Dr. Does what he does::: but he absolutely was supposed to do an MRI after the first visit."" This Dr. took a shortcut and cost me the last 20 years of my life.  There's no accountability at duke. They simply pass the buck to the legal department and start lying.  On 11/5/19::: I was informed by a PA in the Duke Cancer Clinic that my doctor had failed to perform an MRI in a timely manner and due to this::: my cancer has spread from my prostate bed and I will now need radiation treatments. These radiation treatments will cause missed time from work and will result in the loss of my ability to earn income::: perhaps permanently::: and will almost certainly leave me impotent::: and with incontinence problems.  The PA twice told me that the doctor should have performed an MRI after our first meeting and should not have delayed the MRI for 6 months::: as he did. The PA stated:::""sometim es::: I don't know why he does what he does::: but he should not have put off the MRI."" As a result of the MRI being delayed by 6 months::: the cancer has spread. Had the MRI been done promptly::: the lesions would have been found and the operation would have been scheduled and the operation would have left me cancer free.  When I presented at Duke::: I informed Dr. Polascik that my Urologist had discovered cancer in my prostate and had recommended that I have the prostate removed in a timely manner. I was told by Dr. Polascik that that was “old thinking” and that I was “not a candidate for surgery.” Near the end of that appointment::: I again asked the doctor why my Urologist would recommend removal of the prostate while he believed that I was not a candidate for surgery. The doctor replied::: “did he really tell you that?” I again confirmed that this was the recommendation. I again was told that::: “that was old thinking and that I needed to come back in 6 months.”  I was told that I have the “exact same cancer that virtually every man in his eighties has in his prostate::: only a lot less of it.” I was they would “do an MRI in six months to see if they could see anything” After the MRI::: I discovered that that I actually had two lesions on the outside of my prostate. The after-surgery report showed the cancer had spread into the prostate bed. Had the MRI been done after the initial visit::: which the PA twice informed me was what was supposed to happen::: the cancer would not have spread.  I HAVE A RECORDING OF THE P.A. TELLING ME THIS.  Additionally::: they failed to treat my severe pain for four hours after surgery. They failed to use the spirometer after surgery. They sent me home without adequate pain meds and told me to call the nurses line if I needed them. When I called I was told they would be called in within 15 minutes. It actually took 6 hours and 10 calls to get them to finally call in the meds. When I asked the nurse why I was getting such terrible service::: she hung up on me. And no::: I do not have a history of opioid abuse.  They are overbooked. Too many patients::: and when you slip through the cracks and file a complaint::: they don't respond to the complaint.  Do yourself a favor::: choose a hospital and doctor that puts the patient before profits. Their failure to perform an MRI has ruined my future.  You shouldn't come away from an experience like this needing a medical malpractice attorney.",❤️❤️❤️❤️My wife left me a month ago and she was leaving with another man who is 6years older than her i feel like my life is completely over. I read over the internet how a spell caster have help several people to get there love back.

The Duke Clinical Research Institute is leading a study to determine if three FDA-approved medications for other uses could be used to treat mild-to-moderate COVID-19.

We have also had children in and out to care for during this pandemic. So far::: there have been nine occurances of Covid 19 in my household. None of us have had to go to the doctor::: a hospital::: or on a respirator. Here is the protocol we used to fight back with:,2. If the feeling persists::: I take ginko biloba::: echinacea and elderberry extract. Ginko is a natural anti-viral to keep it out of the lungs. If I feel it going into my brochia and lungs I start Gensing. Tylenol and tepid showers for fever::: plenty of fluids::: rest and isolate.,Who would be so ignorant as believe a study done by political hacks,1. Mask in stores....I have even used tea tree oil on a cloth as a filter.

And the #Duke2021 commencement speaker is ...  TODAY.DUKE.EDU John Legend to Deliver 2021 Commencement Address,2021-04-20 15:04:00,Huh,I would also like to add that the people who are putting obnoxious racist misinformed comments on this post probably don’t have any association with Duke University. They read like trolls who spend their free time browsing public posts in order to add inflammatory comments. And are probably not worth anyone’s time. I am a proud employee of this esteemed institution::: and I am very impressed of its work at all levels to begin to tear down structural racism within and beyond the university.,These are all amazing and inspiring leaders! Thank you!!,Was about to say how jealous I was::: but then realized I was even luckier that I got to hear John Legend speak AND play when I was at Duke 😂,I just saw a commercial with John Legend. I was listening without watching. In my mind::: I was saying::: “this is Martin Short”. So::: when I looked and saw that it was John Legend::: it was odd. Does anyone else notice how exactly they sound alike?,Pretty disappointed that people look up to individuals like him just to go with the flow and not be strong with their own convictions!!,He was OUTSTANDING!!,Would't be on my list for speaker.,Yah! Congratulations to all those 2021 Graduates !!! Yah !,Don’t know him well enough to comment::: does he have any connection with Duke?,🤮 And::: my son’s graduating class had Coach K. Yeah. Kind of the same. 🤔 (NOT!),"Why would anyone expect a non ""woke""::: progressive or liberal nut job to deliver an address especially if it is on how to feed off of the government and oppression...",Interesting choice. Will listen in,Happy for the choice of class of 2021 but Class of 2020 should have been a priority,UPenn 2014 Commencement,Legend will blast ✌️,Glad I don’t have to sit through that foolishness!,What about the class of 2020?,What? Is he going to lecture our children about how oppressed they are for being a minority? This is not at all a good choice. A catholic university selecting an abortionist. Just to be woke::: what a disappointment.,Please let him sing his remarks!,Didn’t he go to Penn?,🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 I’d be mad if I went to Duke. Poor choice,Pls bring him back for class of 2025 🤞🤞,At least it is not his wife! I will say he has got to be better than the awful speaker Duke hade in 2008!!!,Sad.,Matthew Troy,❤️ 💕 Love,David Jones::: where was John Legend when you graduated?!,Sarah Artz 😲,Rhonda Bartee,Mandy Schnell,Maria Bareka 🤩,Wow,Yah ! Congratulations to all those 2021 Graduates !!!!,Kaori Torres,An idiot,Max Povejsil Go back?,Excellent choice! ❤️,OMG! So jealous!,Wow!

It is mRNA meaning you’re injected with nanotechnology (synthetic) spike protein sending messages to your cell to respond to ANY virus with spike proteins. This is not a dead or live virus as with all previous vaccines. We have no idea if it will induce future extreme cytokine storms in the body when exposed to any other future virus we at each exposed to. This is a giant experiment. This is the only shot ever using the mRNA....this is not a vaccine. Wrong terminology as vaccines need FDA approval.  Did you know that no emergency use authorized products can be mandated. That goes for the vaccine::: the PCR test::: and the mask! The law is 21 U.S.Code 360bbb-3.

Our community mourns the loss of Nathaniel “Nat” B. White Jr. — One of the first five Black undergraduate students at Duke. Born and raised in Durham::: White earned a bachelor’s of science degree in mathematics from Duke in 1967. He went on to a remarkable career in public health and neighborhood development  TODAY.DUKE.EDU Nathaniel White Jr.::: One of First Black Undergraduates at Duke::: Dies at Age 75,2021-03-26 15:37:01,Clearly required courage to be among the very first. Proud that he was a Durham native.,I didn't realize there had only been Black undergrads for less than TEN years when I was there. 😥🤔,George Floyd was high as a kite the day he died. He had just committed a felony::: and resisted arrest. Officer Chauvin is being smeared by cop-hating racists and will be acquitted because facts matter in the court of law::: not feelings.,"Nat is missed.  . . .  But see https:// www.dailymail.co .uk/news/ article-9406225/ Investigation-pr intout-George-F loyds-toxicolog y-report-pinned -display.html (""Duke University launches investigation after a printout of George Floyd's toxicology report was pinned to a Black History Month display"")  The officials at Duke should be chastised if not removed for curtailing freedom of speech::: and preventing the truth about Floyd's criminality from being trumpeted far and wide.  There is no way that he's a hero of any kind. Indeed::: it is likely he would have died that day without ANY involvement by the officer; and that the officer was not responsible for his death.  This is racism in its purest form::: brought to us by America's Left that has coddled and embraced the thugs::: slugs::: hoods and mongrels of ""Black Lives Matter:::"" Antifa and other far-Left groups that have burned our cities::: killed or hurt innocent Americans including our police::: and destroyed black and other businesses.  . . .  Nat is not Floyd and the other thugs who have dishonored what Nat brought to Duke.",RIP Nat 💔,I am so sorry to hear this!,R.I.P.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Effective at midnight::: Mar. 13::: all Duke undergraduate students are required to stay-in-place until 9 a.m.::: Sunday::: Mar. 21  The goal of the stay-in-place period is to stop the spread of COVID among the undergraduate population as quickly as possible  https://coronavirus.duke.edu/2021/03/stay-in-place-for-duke-undergraduate-students-effective-at-midnight-saturday-march-13/,2021-03-14 01:18:43,Duke students have a diminished IQ since I was there 56 years ago.,Covid deniers are the reason this will never end....if you got into duke your intelligent... what fraternity in their right minds would allow anyone to go near a fraternity during an epidemic... what student would ever go near any group setting during an epidemic? Can’t you all just wait a year or two? You know show maturity? Unbelievable 15 months in ....I understand denial is an effective coping mechanism but how could you be so selfish and lack such basic common sense? To dance and drink? Insane ... this I why it all should be virtual ... so many young people can’t handle the responsibility of existing in a pandemic ...,Students at U of Vermont are tested weekly. It is required. My grandson had to be tested twice a week until his cough was gone. He tested negative for Covid but until his cough was gone he could not attend in person class. Showed his maturity by not complaining although he had to walk in snow for tests.,Duke University - I'm pretty sure this is illegal and may constitute false imprisonment. I would encourage any Duke student affected by this communist-like attack to contact an attorney to ensure their legal rights are protected and to see if they can seek civil damages.,This lockdown was caused by the rush events hosted by Durham Interfraternity Council.

Those are grown adults who can do what they want in a free country.",Appreciate the administration of Duke for taking action quickly!,And we were the gold standard of NC universities until this! Like::: our students were taking everything so seriously with COVID. Hard to believe they'd have rush when we're on the 10 yard line.,I urge all students to ignore this::: Duke university do not have legal authority to restrict your movement,Wow what a difference a State makes! My 2 are at UofSC - IN CLASS & everything open. My son rushing too. Currently 81 cases this week. 95% availability on isolation capacity. My kids have had a great College experience. (& they both had Covid early on) I am very proud of UofSC and how they’ve handled Covid since last Aug when kids started.,Dukies party and party and party...please protect yourselves now in order to party again later🙂,Wouldn't listen. Would tell the administration to suck my duke.,Can we rescind the medical degree for Sen Rand Paul? This guy is a total embarrassment for our medical school.,Oh::: no! Stay safe::: Dukies.,Hope they will listen and follow the rules 😳because I stay here with punch of them and they partying all weekends!,If Duke actually cared::: they'd ban Greek life and frats. All of these cases came from frats or freshman at frats.,Duke at least is open no like UC Berkeley crazy Cali .,Duke had to drop out of the ACC tournament and will likely not goto the NCAA tournament for the first time in 25 years. So yeah COVID19 is a big deal.,Don't blame the students::: blame the person that everyone has been blaming until Jan. 20 hint hint wink wink right?,Duke hasn't been and isn't now fooling around. They are taking it seriously unlike some of the students.,Why? This sounds like a 'Flatten the Curve' measure and the curve is crashing and doesn't need flattening. This is a bit of an overreaction at this point.,Anticipate vaccines will be required to attend school starting in the fall.,Students are the same everywhere from Santa monica city college to Duke. They get covid. Don't care cuz they don't get ill.,lol you students that love to party will never learn we are in the middle of a pandemic and you just run into your party mode again now 180 of you now have COVID again.......I swear COVID is never going to go away with how stupid this generation is  https:// www.yahoo.com/ news/ 6-000-students-d uke-ordered-162 545728.html,Carolyn,Shane Berry,Del Curling,Fraternity rush.

How many times I had the sheer pleasure of hearing Sam perform! What a loss and sad day for Duke.,Sad to hear of his passing. When I was in grad school Duke::: I always enjoyed hearing him play the carillon. The sounds were always beautiful and uplifting. And there were days when I needed that!,May his soul rest in perfect peace in the arms of Christ Jesus our eternal lover. I pray for consolation for all his family and lived ones. May the great rewarder richly reward him for his great work,Sam played the carillon after our wedding in 2006 at Duke Chapel. So thankful for Sam and sorry to hear of his passing.💔🙏🏾,I grew up listening to the beautiful and peaceful sounds of his music. When I moved from Durham to Phila::: it was one of the chief sounds I missed. God bless him.,So very sorry. Prayers for his family and friends.,He blessed Duke Chapel with beautiful music for many years! So thankful he shared his talents!,My condolences. Such a sad loss for the Duke community.,May his soul rest in peace 🙏🏻 Prayers and condolences 💐,Condolences 🙏🏻,As much as I remember listening to Mr. Hammond play the bells as I walked around campus::: I also have fond memories of watching him walk to and from campus or help students at Duke String School. He will be missed.,I got to know Sam a little working at the Rare Book Room. He was wonderful and so gifted. This is very sad news.,Thank you so much for this beautiful bell music from ‘88-92! Sending a virtual hug to his family and loved ones. His music made my day! 🎶❤️,I believe he was responsible for the music during the Allen Building takeover in 1968? Well never forget tear gas wafting over West Campus while the theme song from the Mickey Mouse Club played from the Chapel.,RIP Sam 💔,😥😥,Ann Sperry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Good to see the sun again ☀️,2021-02-23 17:05:49,Beautiful Duke!!!,"I am appalled::: but not surprised::: at the decision of the Center for the History of Political Economy at Duke University to bring Bjorn Lomborg to give a talk on “climate alarmism” as part of the Hayek Lecture Series.

Then::: lastly::: before the door out::: a room of well-spaced (way after the exposure and its hopefully-submi tted- to preventative) chairs to sit in even longer for more crowd indoor exposure while one waits to make a followup appointment and for the unlikely allergic reactions.

Sounds like I might need a lawyer to get vaccinated?? lolol,Ready for mine......anyti me,Wow. I couldn’t imagine being excited to inject an unknown vaccine with side effects into my arm...,Not “ unknown”. SMH,Happy for those Duke healthcare workers!,Gotta catch me first. Nope to being a dope.,What if healthcare workers start dieing off !!!,Everyone has a choice... but as a healthcare worker who has seen many COVID patients. I can attest to the terrible death they have to endure. I have seen COVID pts so sick they wanted to die. I have seen COVID pt fighting for their life but end up dead. It’s a horrible debilitating virus with more residual effects than the vaccine,I can’t wait to get mine. Dec 28. Happy days are here again,Sign me up!!!,Checking in... This is Faye Williams. I want everyone to know that I am feeling just fine. I have had NO side effects. I feel supported by the Health System and truly trust the science. Hundreds (not kidding) of people have stopped by to see me::: text or emailed me. I am just one example that the vaccine works. Will check in again after the second dose.,Why don’t you take flu shot??,Very wary of these vaccines. Especially the one being rolled Out by Moderna. Bill Gates. Highly suspect. I for one say thanks but no thanks!!! I’ll take my chance on a virus that has a 98% survival Rate for the majority of us. 🙏🏼❤️ I do pray for those who are sick or who get sick that they will recover. !!!,Check back with them in a year and see if they have 3 heads..😛😛,https:// www.facebook.com / creativewriters1 993,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thankfully::: we have a president who prioritized the vaccine and fast-tracked it. The likely new president wasn’t even sure he was running for president most of the time.

Duke Divinity School professor Brent Strawn explains how the Old Testament's toolbox of ancient texts can help address the problems we face in the world today  STORIES.DIVINITY.DUKE.EDU Brent Strawn on Why the Old Testament Still Matters,2020-09-13 16:12:01,Andrew Bates,Rian Ray,"God never lies and history is being repeated. We pray for repentance amongst our Duke friends ASAP. There is only so much He tolerates. The 3 days of darkeness are likely to come again and perhaps soon. The violence in our streets and fires everywhere are seemingly unrelated to most intellectuals::: yet many know something is afoot. Please Use the rosary as your weapon against evil and have blessed bees wax candles for the time in which no natural light will shine other than from those candles blessed for this purpose. IS 13:[9] ""Behold::: the day of the Lord shall come::: a cruel day::: and full of indignation::: and of wrath::: and fury::: to lay the land desolate::: and to destroy the sinners thereof out of it. [10] For the stars of heaven::: and their brightness shall not display their light: the sun shall be darkened in his rising::: and the moon shall not shine with her light. [11] And I will visit the evils of the world::: and against the wicked for their iniquity: and I will make the pride of infidels to cease::: and will bring down the arrogancy of the mighty.""",Brayden Ray,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We will always remember the nearly 3:::000 people killed on September 11::: 2001  In memory of the six Duke alumni we lost: Michael Morgan Taylor ‘81::: Frederick C. Rimmele III::: M.D. ‘94::: A. Todd Rancke ‘81::: Christopher Todd Pitman ‘93::: Peter Ortale ‘87::: and J. Robinson “Rob” Lenoir ‘84,2020-09-11 13:30:07,We will never forget 😞,Why is it always have to be negativity on everything . Can't we just remember those who lost there lives . That day had nothing to do with supporting or defunding anything . Respect to all involved in this tragic day .,And all those who died this year due to the callousness and foolishness of the President. Please vote sensibly!,And the 200000 who have died this year because the president didn’t want to cause a panic,"Hmmm..but is this the post to comment on Duke supporting organizations and faculty that want to defund police I wonder? I guess they don't ""remember"" who went up those flights of stairs over and over again::: or stayed after at Ground Zero for months to do the dirty work. Make sure our little Dukies understand you can't talk out of two sides of the same mouth. They weren't born yet: educate them for real.",I was with my son in Duke's Children's Hospital while he received a bone marrow transplant::: far away from our family::: in Maryland. We were watching something on tv as all the doctors came pouring into the parent's lounge::: where I and another mother were having breakfast. They went right to the tv and changed the channel. It took us a few minutes to figure out what was going on. The first plane had just hit the tower. We thought it was a small plane. It went on from there.,🙏🏻,Kenzo Archer 司徒雷風,Murdered*,Last donation is make to them after reading that!!,Remembering those Duke alums who perished in the horror of 9/11.

Months into the coronavirus pandemic and the term “virus” still receives plenty of attention.  But what exactly is a virus and how does it work?  YOUTUBE.COM What is a virus? | Quick Learner,2020-09-10 15:19:03,"Where do viruses come from? For decades it's been my ""theory"" that ALL types of viruses originated from ""broken"" partial strands of DNA or RNA of their original ""host"" species. After countless millennia of ""evolving"" and gaining a protective protein coat::: these tiny::: broken/ partial bits of genetic material gained the ability to spread to other individuals of that species through bodily fluids::: instead of just moving cell to cell in their original host organism like Messenger RNA. Analogy: fish and most amphibians like frogs and salamanders have moist skins and cannot live on dry land for long periods. After millions of years::: some amphibians evolved into reptiles with protective scales. Their descendants could survive out of water::: on dry land. Similar evolution occurred in viruses: the original partial::: ""broken"" bit of DNA or RNA from an original ""host"" organism could not survive outside a cell or outside the body of the original ""host"" organism. After eons of evolution::: the RNA or DNA genetic core of the virus gained a protective protein coat and could travel outside the original host through droplets of bodily fluids. Viruses were never ""independent"" life forms like bacteria: a tiny::: fragile bit of species-specific DNA or RNA could not have originated::: survived::: reproduced and evolved outside a cell of their original host organism. Some viruses infect plants::: some infect animals. Usually viruses infect a particular host species::: but ""zoonotic viruses"" like rabies::: ebola::: and coronaviruses can ""jump species."" Some ""species/ families"" of viruses have existed for tens of millions of years::: but new viruses are likely being ""born"" as you read this.",Take this huge opportunity today to live your dream as a UX Designer::: UI Designer::: UX Researcher::: Design Ops::: or Agile Project Manager.

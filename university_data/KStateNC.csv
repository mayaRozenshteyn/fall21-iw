Kimball Avenue will close from Denison Avenue to North Manhattan Avenue starting Monday::: October 18::: for the next phase of the North Campus Corridor Project. Both the road and the multi-use trail will be closed to the public within the project limits. Variable Message Boards (VMS) were installed on Monday::: October 4::: announcing closure. Detour signage and traffic control for vehicles and cyclists/pedestrians will be installed soon.

This phase is a total reconstruction of the street::: storm drainage system::: and sidewalks. The project will begin with relocation of telecommunication lines followed by demolition of the old cattle bridge.

This phase of the project will improve safety in this segment of the corridor through geometric improvements by widening the width of the street to include a raised::: center median between oncoming traffic along the curves of the roadway. This $4 million project is funded primarily through an Economic Development Grant from the Kansas Department of Transportation (KDOT).

The contractor::: Bayer Construction::: estimates partial completion of the project by mid-August 2022::: with one lane opening in each direction. Final completion is expected by December 2022::: weather permitting.

Btw K-State::: the kids and I are still waiting on an answer!

This is AMERICA! A FREE country! Everyone has rights::: not just those who are going along with what is being pushed as the current days’ narrative.

Everyone who wants a vaccine has gotten one at this point and even the science shows breakthrough infections are extremely limited and never result in severe illness. You are punishing a large amount of the student/

June 21 at 12:04 PM ·

Hello horticulturists::: horticulture fans::: and followers! Happy official summer-\-\hope you're enjoying the cooler weather today!

So to continue with our yearly update::: 'Aromaticus' is flowering AGAIN! This is the 5th year in a row! And to add more excitement to the news::: it currently has TWO::: yes::: TWO inflorescences.

The first inflorescence (one to the left; yellowish colored spadix) is about ready to open. The spathe (frilly structure) has colored and there have been slight wafts of 'fragrance'. And the growth has essentially stopped with it being 52"" tall. It should open in the next day or two.

The second inflorescence is still growing. Earlier this morning::: it was at 49.5"" and now this afternoon it was over 50”. It will likely flower within the next 5 to 7 days.

This is quite a unique situation for many reasons. First::: the continued yearly flowering. ‘Aromaticus’ has flowered for the last 4 years! And second::: the two inflorescences!

AND...we have THREE more meristems or growing points (second picture; red arrows). It's a bit early to tell if they are going to be leaves or perhaps *gulp* MORE inflorescences!?!?!

We have been capturing the growth and development of the inflorescences so we will have another time lapse!

https://www.k-state.edu/today/info/announcement/?id=73204",2/26/2021 19:41,Great response::: K-State! I am proud of how this has been addressed and the plans to create an opportunity for dialog. Just one more reason to love this university!,Be Kind. We can do this.,I see we are back to statements instead of meaningful work,This is an absolute joke. You are failing your students::: and showing us that you truly don’t care for their well-being. Do something for once,Since some need to be reminded what they should of learned at 2 here you go “if you don’t have anything nice to say then say nothing” seriously leave others alone!,I would say that I am happy about Kansas State releasing a statement::: however this has been an ongoing issue on this campus that words can't address or erase. Kansas State you have to take action once and for all::: you can't just keep saying you are addressing these issues with no real intention for change. As an alumni and as a parent with four children that have either graduated or presently attending the university::: this makes me so angry. I'm so tired of witnessing this over and over and even having my own child attacked on a social media platform last summer by followers of Jaden McNeil::: for standing up to racism and horrible attacks of other students. This matter was brought to your attention::: along with the noose hanging on campus and many other incidents and nothing has really changed with it all. My hope is that the problem is truly addressed::: the ones that did this will be caught and held accountable for their actions::: and Kansas State can actually provide the support and atmosphere that is safe and inclusive for all students.,Good intentions are worthless without acting on those intentions.,I didn't spend $55:::000 for my degree to keep seeing my alma mater struggle to combat racism and white supremacy. Do something::: I am sure I am not the only one who is tired of seeing these statements at our school.,Stop being a victim man. The real world is much more difficult then some stupid person expressing hate. Teach the tools to deal with divisive and racist thought. You don’t have to be a victim. There will be people throughout your life that are going to say really hurtful things but you can overcome it by educating against ignorance and rebuking those that won’t change.,So glad the university released ANOTHER statement instead of actually doing something about it.,As an alumni::: I have to say this limited response by your administration disappoints me on a deep level. Should there not be cameras posted at these sites to monitor for this kind of behavior? This is not a new occurrence at K-State this year as white nationalist speech and behavior has happened at online events and on campus throughout 2020::: yes? I feel this reactive response where a written apology is issued does not uphold the values K-State claims to uphold. Being proactive and monitoring these sites in order to hold those responsible accountable would be a better::: more proactive step in the right direction. Surely as a large state school you have the resources.,brings back good memories,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No reason to pay all that money to live on campus.,Difficult decisions in difficult times.,Sad::: but the right thing to do.,I wish I didn’t have to pay a higher tuition to accommodate an online platform when it wasn’t a choice the students made.,It’s planned only for 2 weeks for now..,Shelly Crites Ewy,who could have foreseen this🤯,"From KSU: “With the goal of mitigating the continued spread of COVID-19::: Kansas State University will begin the first two weeks of the spring semester with remote learning classes. “
Followed by: “Student services such as on-campus housing::: libraries::: recreation centers and Lafene Health Center will be operational on Monday::: Jan. 25::: following the same safety protocols as the fall semester. Move-in dates for spring 2021 on-campus housing will not change.... Spring 2021 housing and dining charges and the campus privilege fee assessment will not be affected by this decision.” Interesting choices KSU! Are athletics going to continue?",Just put Laura on a plane back to Western Colorado U. Gunnison is so remote that it's relatively safe for in person learning.,Trace Hostetter,Cool! Tuition discounts!!!,So I get to continue to pay for a lease I haven't needed at all (all my classes were online in the fall) and for facilities I'm not going to use and for in person classes that are partially online now? Most students are tied into contracts and are paying to live there anyways. Many of my friends and people I know are still going to move back to Manhattan. Really hoping this doesn't turn into a fully remote semester like last spring. Also I'm quite confused at how some of my labs and higher level courses are going to do online. Can't really learn hands on skills from a computer and didn't learn much in the fall due to all online courses,I think it's for 2 weeks to basically get kids their to do a pseudo in place isolation so that if they are positive they find out before in person starts. Colleges in other parts of the country require a negative covid test prior to the 1st classes instead. Hoping we maintain in person in science labs! Hard to do Organic Chemistry lab online or Equine Barn lab online when your supposed to be hands on the horses!,This is the best thing for everyone! It’s a quarantine of sorts to allow any outbreaks to be contained. Yes public schools are back in session however::: college students are out and about more than most “kids” and therefore this 2 week remote learning should help. Everyone will have their own opinion and that is fine if you don’t agree. We have been in this for 10 months and EVERYTHING is hard for EVERY business (colleges included). NOTHING is fair::: EVERYTHING has changed::: and with that comes growing pains. Give some grace and be thankful you don’t have to make decisions that affect 21:::000+ people (all of whom have opinions and won’t be satisfied). BREATHE and give grace!,Nicole Pisterzi,I’ve taught in a classroom full of kids since August. We have had zero school spread. Come on K-State::: wear a mask (teachers and students) and be in person! You’re not helping stop the spread by allowing them to live in group housing so you might as well let them go to school. Or::: if it’s virtual give us the choice to not pay for dorms/food during that time and let the kids do online from home.,All this remote stuff is not helping the university at all.,Emily Thompson,"Our local high school is doing ""gateway"" testing with Abbott's $5 rapid test. To avoid false positives::: any positive test is repeated. According to the outside experts hired by the District::: this will result in a false positive risk of .03%. Bottom line is that testing is cheap::: reliable and easily accessible. Processing the test does not require highly skilled personnel and results are available in 15 minutes or less. Instead of asking students to come incubate for 2 weeks (insuring nothing but boredom and bad choices)::: I wish the University would consider inexpensive gateway testing as a means to get these students back in the classroom! This is EXACTLY the kind of thing Federal $$ should be used for. Let's look harder for best practices::: exercise innovation::: and fight harder to do right by the students who are ready to learn in community. If our local high school can do this::: surely K State can find a way.",Nick Geiger,And yet vet students must appear in person. Is their health less important?

"Riley County Health Department is sharing a COVID-19 Update.
November 18::: 2020 at 12:03 PM ·

As COVID-19 cases increase in Kansas::: Riley County is launching a 14-day challenge to support front-line workers and health care providers. If everyone does their part to slow the spread of COVID-19::: we can prevent hospitals and medical staff from being overwhelmed. Please join the fight for front line workers and prevent the shortage of hospital beds::: doctors::: and nurses.

For the next 14 days::: everyone is asked to commit to:

• Consistently and correctly wearing a mask and keeping at least 6 ft apart at all times in indoor and outdoor spaces (other than at home with the people in your immediate household)

• Washing and sanitizing hands frequently

• Working from home if possible and holding meetings online rather than in person

• Avoiding being indoors with non-household members except for school::: work that cannot be done from home::: and activities deemed essential

• Supporting local businesses by consistently and correctly wearing a mask::: maintaining distance::: and ordering online or by phone::: with curbside pickup or delivery

• Supporting local restaurants by maintaining at least 6 ft of distance::: consistently and correctly wearing a mask::: and by ordering food to go

• Staying home if experiencing any symptoms of illness::: and Remaining in isolation or quarantine for the recommended period if positive for COVID-19 or if identified as a close contact

• Calling the Riley County Screening Line 785-323-6400 or your doctor for advice about testing if experiencing any symptoms of COVID-19

• Practicing healthy habits: eating healthy food::: exercising regularly::: getting enough sleep

The challenge is based on health guidelines and modeled after initiatives in other Kansas communities.

“The rapid increase of COVID cases poses a real threat to the medical community:::” said Local Health Officer Julie Gibbs. “If the hospital becomes overwhelmed with severe cases::: they lose the ability to care for other patients. We have to take action now to prevent that from happening.”

K-State’s commencement ceremonies originally scheduled to take place November 20-22 have been canceled due to the rapid::: uncontrolled increase in positive COVID-19 cases in the campus communities throughout the state. Instead::: virtual recognitions will take place in December.

""With hundreds of new cases announced in our host communities in the past few days::: the trend line is absolutely going in the wrong direction:::"" said Richard B. Myers::: university president. ""Concerns have been expressed by our students::: faculty and staff not only for their personal health::: but with a willingness to look out for the health of fellow K-Staters.""

Community partners endorsing this initiative include: Riley County::: Riley County Health Department::: Riley County Emergency Operations Center::: City of Manhattan::: Kansas State University::: Ascension Via Christi Hospital of Manhattan::: and the MHK Clinical Task Force.

For more information about Riley County’s response to the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic::: visit the Riley County website at www.rileycountyks.gov/coronavirus::: follow RCHD on Facebook at /Rileycountyhealthdepartment/ and Twitter @RileyCoHealth.

You know::: because that makes sense,Ashley Bratton Holly Wilson,Perhaps Alums should express their concerns by skipping those dues.,I can't fathom how high schools were able to figure out a way to have ceremonies MONTHS AGO::: but K-State wasn't. If only there were some large outdoor gathering space::: like a stadium perhaps::: that the ceremony could've been held at while maintaining prudent social distance. If only K-State had some sort of facility like that. The administration should be embarrassed.,Graduation canceled but sports continue.

I understand wanting to stay safe and healthy. But::: there was time and space to have graduation. There was time and space to acknowledge this achievement for them. These young adults worked hard::: took out loans::: sacrificed parts of their lives to get the degree. You preach education is important::: college is important::: how knowledge will take your far. Yet you have not done your job to recognize this! You did however show how more important football is. How more important athletes are. How more important the athletic family is!! High schools across this country figured out how to have graduation for their seniors. High schools showed their students how much their accomplishments
meant. High schools showed their students that they are family. High schools that have smaller stadiums and smaller budgets figured out how to do what needed to be done. All while maintaining social distance. They still had processions::: speeches::: pictures::: guests. Why/how could K-State not figure it out? Why did you not use Bill Snyder FAMILY Stadium? Oh wait!! Because K-State doesn't consider students FAMILY!!! Unless the students are playing on the field they are not good enough to use it! Football is more important than graduation!!! K-State let the young adults down. They continue to let them down. You preach FAMILY but where is it? Where is the FAMILY figuring out for these young adults how to have graduation like there was FAMILY to figure out how to have football and other sports? You K-STATE were worried about money! Because football/
sports brings in money graduation does not. These young adults already gave you all the money. $40::: 000 to $100:::000 give or take a few thousand either way. With a graduation ceremony at the end to be their reward. But you don't get extra $$$ for that reward so you didn't care.

I have had it! Come back to school for in person classes::: but 50% or more online! Come to football games::: but not to graduation! It is ALL about money!!!!,I hear you K-Staters! University of Louisville did the same thing to us! So very infuriating 😡😡. They offered us a virtual graduation::: but they already did that lame event in May! Why would I want to watch a bunch of pre-recorded messages again from the department heads and president:/,Susan Crary Baldwin,"I’m sooo glad we could
Have a fball game today but not graduation. Are you refunding any money spend on graduation. Asking for family","We all need to
Call the president of the university instead of making comments on here. It’s all about the $$$ of keeping fball on and not flipping graduation",People should boycott the sports to show unity for the students. They deserve better. In the end it's the student body that makes any school not sports. PROVE ME WRONG,"Office of the President

919 Mid-Campus Dr.::: North
Manhattan::: Ks 66506

Let’s flood them with letters. Move graduation to Bill Snyder Stadium or no football. I’ll freeze my butt off for my daughter without hesitation. And I don’t think the ceremony would last nearly as long as a football game!",It would be nice if all graduates names could be read::: even if they are not participating in the ceremony.,Jenny Clark,So if someone could explain to me how if a university is supposed to be about education::: how is it that we cancel graduation but continue all the sporting events? Can someone from the logic department explain this? Don't we still have people traveling when there is a sporting event?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Riley County Health Department is sharing a COVID-19 Update.
November 4::: 2020 at 11:49 AM ·

11-4-20 Update: 60 New Positive Cases

(RILEY COUNTY::: KS – November 4::: 2020) Riley County has 60 new positive cases and 59 additional recoveries since Monday’s report.

Ascension Via Christi Hospital in Manhattan is caring for 5 positive patients at this time. The patients have symptoms severe enough to require hospitalization.

“It is critical that we all do our part to slow the spread::: especially going into the holiday and flu seasons:::” said RCHD Emergency Preparedness Coordinator Renee Lucas.

RCHD is planning to offer free testing every Thursday through the end of the year::: except the weeks of Thanksgiving and Christmas. Location details are being finalized::: but two time periods will be available each Thursday: 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. and 5:00 to 7:00 p.m.

The next free::: drive-up testing will be offered at CiCo Park in Manhattan on November 5. Everyone is welcome to participate. Please enter the park from the Kimball/Candlewood entrance and drive to the 4H barns near Pottorf Hall for testing. This is the same route used for the monthly Harvesters food distribution.

Anyone who has symptoms::: is a close contact of a positive patient::: or would like information about how to get tested should contact their health care provider or call the Riley County Screening Line at 785-323-6400. The Screening Line is staffed by nurses and is available Monday through Friday from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.

Riley County Statistics for Wednesday::: November 4::: 2020:
• Total positive cases in Riley County Residents: 2:::311
• Total active: 145
• Total recovered: 2:::154
• Total deaths: 12
• Total negative test results: 20:::213

Positive Rate
• Week 44 (October 25 – 31): 9.7%
115 positives
1:::186 total tests
• Week 43 (October 18-24): 6.4%
83 positive
1:::288 total tests
• Two-week average: 8.0%
198 positives
2:::474 total tests

Case counts are preliminary and subject to verification. Patient test results are calculated in the week the test was administered::: not the week in which results were received. As results come in for previous weeks::: the percent positive information is updated. Typically::: results are processed in 48 to 72 hours for tests in Riley County. Percent positive information will now be updated each Wednesday::: to allow time more test results to come in.

Riley County has four active outbreaks::: meaning positive cases are linked by location and time of spread. One new outbreak was identified with 10 new cases among the K-State Track & Field team. Team members attended a Halloween party last weekend and contact tracing staff are working to identify and call all known close contacts. All K-State athletes are being tested regularly.

The 9/26 wedding outbreak expired today. A total of 25 cases were associated with that event and all of those patients have recovered. See a PDF of outbreak information at https://www.rileycountyks.gov/DocumentCenter/View/19657/11-4-public-outbreak-info

The next video update will be today::: Wednesday::: November 4th at 4:15 p.m. on the Riley County Health Department’s Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/Rileycountyhealthdepartment/.

Drive-up flu shots are available at the health department. Please make an appointment by calling 785-776-4779 ext. 7675 or schedule an appointment online at https://www.rileycountyks.gov/1785/Flu

Patients with health insurance will not pay out-of-pocket for the flu shot and RCHD will bill insurance companies directly. Patients who do not have health insurance will be asked to pay a $20 fee for the injection::: but will not be charged the full price of the vaccine.

Unfair elections lead to politicians and their enablers who appreciate unfairness::: which leads to more unfairness.

Most Americans think it is wrong that the candidate with the most national popular votes can lose a presidential election.
We don't allow this in any other election in our representative republic.

The bill is 73% of the way to guaranteeing the majority of Electoral College votes and the presidency to the candidate who receives the most popular votes in the country.
The bill changes state statewide winner-take-all
laws (not mentioned in the U.S. Constitution::: but later enacted by 48 states)::: without changing anything in the Constitution::: using the built-in method that the Constitution provides for states to make changes.

It requires enacting states with 270 electoral votes to award their electoral votes to the winner of the most national popular votes.

All votes would be valued equally in presidential elections::: no matter where voters live.

rate? Is it greater than::: or less than::: COVID-19?

From the CDC: ""January 11::: 2019 – With the 2018-2019 flu season well underway::: CDC today estimated that so far this season::: between about 6 million and 7 million people have been sick with flu::: up to half of those people have sought medical care for their illness::: and between 69:::000 and 84:::000 people have been hospitalized from flu. CDC expects flu activity to continue for weeks and continues to recommend flu vaccination and appropriate use of antiviral medications.""

So::: let's do the math.

COVID-19:
3 /
679 = 0.0044 * 100 = 0.44% hospitalization rate

Influenza::: Jan. 2019
69:::000 /

Riley County Health Department is sharing a COVID-19 Update.
August 28::: 2020 at 12:45 PM ·

8-28-20 Update: 411 Active Cases::: 394 Recovered

(RILEY COUNTY::: KS – August 28::: 2020) Riley County has 136 new positive cases and 15 more recoveries since Wednesday’s report. The totals are now 411 active::: 394 recovered::: and 5 deaths. This is the biggest two-day increase in local cases since the start of the pandemic. A total of 128::: or 94%::: of the new patients are in the 18-24 age group and have had mild symptoms.

“I am encouraged by the fact that we are not seeing significantly ill patients at this point:::” said Kyle Goerl::: MD::: CAQSM::: Medical Director for K-State’s Lafene Health Center.

Ascension Via Christi Hospital in Manhattan is caring for 1 positive patient and zero PUI* patients at this time. The patient has symptoms severe enough to require hospitalization.

New areas of outbreak have been declared in Riley County. The four new outbreaks are associated with the following sororities: Alpha Delta Pi (6)::: Alpha Xi Delta (6)::: Chi Omega (5)::: and Kappa Delta (5). All residents of any Greek house where an outbreak has been declared should quarantine for 14 days. Residents may return to their permanent homes to complete the quarantine period if they prefer. The quarantine time period begins for all of the residents on the date when the outbreak is declared.

“The leaders of local fraternities and sororities are cooperating with health department staff::: but we have concerns that the safety messages are not reaching all of the members:::” said Local Health Officer Julie Gibbs. “It is imperative that anyone who has had close contact with a positive patient::: or who is sick::: remains in quarantine or isolation and takes personal responsibility for their actions.”

In effort to slow the spread of the virus among this population::: all event permits associated with any fraternity and sorority organizations between August 27 and September 10 were canceled or revoked. It is no longer deemed safe to hold these events in person and they may not take place.

“Fraternity and sorority members must take individual responsibility to assure the health of their community and Manhattan:::” said Jordan Kocher::: Director of Fraternity and Sorority Life at K-State. “While our chapters have their health and safety protocols::: now is the time for individuals to mirror their behavior to their values. It is our expectation that members participate in contact tracing::: stay in quarantine or isolation when instructed to do so::: and obtain testing if recommended. Action will be taken should chapters ignore local health orders and community policies; individual member action will be reported to chapter leadership and/or their international organizations. Any questions or concerns can be filtered through the accountability form on our website::: www.fslatkstate.com.”

Anyone who has symptoms::: is a close contact of a positive patient::: or would like information about how to get tested should contact their health care provider or call the Riley County Screening Line at 785-323-6400. The Screening Line is staffed by nurses and is available Monday through Friday from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.

Riley County Statistics for Friday::: August 28::: 2020:

• Total positive cases in Riley County Residents: 810
• Total active: 411
• Total recovered: 394
• Total deaths: 5
• Pending test results: 206
• Negative test results: 6:::600
• Average age: 28.4 years old
• Gender: Female: 49.6% (402)::: Male 50.4% (408)

Percent positive information is updated each Monday and is also posted online in the Data & Info section of the Riley County Coronavirus web page at http://rileycountyks.gov/coronavirus.
Case counts are preliminary and subject to verification.

*A PUI is a Person Under Investigation; a patient who has symptoms of COVID-19 and is waiting for test results.

A young Manhattan woman has been fighting for her life after testing positive for COVID-19 in July. She shared her story online and gave permission for us to share it here. Her words are powerful and heartbreaking. We are so grateful she is recovering and hope the community will join us in sending love and support to her. #StrongerTogether

48 days of sickness. 32 days hospitalized.

Since July 1st I have been the sickest I have ever been. For those that do not know::: I tested positive for Coronavirus at the beginning of the month. But::: I failed to get better. After two ER trips::: chest x-rays::: and CT scans it was learned I needed more intensive care and I was transferred to KU Med in Kansas City.

Imagine being 20 years old and getting told you’re not only part of a pandemic::: but you’re going to a hospital two hours from home for who knows how long and you cannot have any visitors::: not even parents. I spent three days in ICU::: five days in isolation in a covid wing::: and now (as of original post) I’m on day 7 of progressive care.

It was learned I have developed an incredibly destructive secondary infection in my right lung due to my Covid infection. I’ve spent the last 13 days with a chest tube hanging out between my ribs draining liquid infection.

Yes::: it hurts. At all times. It was recently discovered that the secondary infection has done enough damage to require surgery to remove most of if not all of my lung::: as it is now too infected to survive. Hopefully I will have surgery sometime this week so I can begin the long road to recovery.

Friends::: especially those of my age::: please use my experience as an example. I am 2 weeks away from turning 21 years old. We are not immune and we are not invincible to this disease because we are young and healthy. I never thought it a million years I would get sick. I never had any underlying conditions::: I never smoked::: I was incredibly healthy and active. But::: I went out::: I hung out with friends::: I never wore a mask unless I had to. And now I regret it all.

We are still at risk. Wear a mask. Wash your hands. Please stay safe.

UPDATE: After 32 days in various wings of the hospital::: I was able to come home on the 19th of August. My surgery went well with no complications. Aside from the overall pain of recovery and chest tubes::: I’m doing well. I’m incredibly happy to be home and be alive and healing. Thank you all for your prayers and thoughts.",8/27/2020 16:47,🙏🏽,Jonna Danyale Owens,So was she a healthy 20 years old all around. There r many factors for all of us. Doesn’t mean all get this sick.

Recovery will be slow.,Prayers for your continued healing and recovery.,Thanks for sharing your story. Hope it will help someone to avoid this.🙏,University spreading fear.,And I’m sure if she had a crystal ball::: that everyone else seems to have::: she would have worn a mask and scaled back some activities::: too. Thank you sharing your story. Be well soon!,"Get smart people::: follow the rules to stay safe!!!!!!! Market or Casket!!!!!!!!!

For yourself and others.👏,I'm glad she's recovering,Tanner Knackstedt Kristen Knackstedt,Thank you for sharing - hopefully the story resonates and possibly saves a life.

education when they would rather take it in person and then they are charged an additional $280 for that four hour class. Why are they being forced to pay an online surcharge when they are not even given an option and are living on campus?",Adelyn Smith Gary Smith,Will Hale finally be fully open this year? I’m sure part of the fees my senior has been paying are for using the library::: which was only available her freshman year.,Edward Sullivan,Coen Osborn,Joe Nolke,Dawn Ross,Devin Elliott,Brett McInroy,My daughter just learned she only has one in person class ... the rest are all on line... of course this is after we leased an apartment which we can’t get out of the lease... she could have stayed in Wichita and driven there 2 times a week for one in person class ... open it up !!!,Natalie Wallace,"K-State::: what is that online per-credit-hour
fee for? Why does it cost K-State more to provide classes online vs in-person? I am trying to be patient and better-understa
nd the situation::: because from where I am sitting now::: my daughter will be paying considerably more per credit hour to sit in a remote room in her scholarship house in Manhattan (also costing her the same amount) while what she is getting in return is arguably 1/4 of what was available to her last year from the same University. Your headline above is deceiving. Students who were in-person learners::: which I'm guessing is the majority of your student body::: are paying considerably more::: due to the EXTRA online fee they will now most likely have to pay and be getting much less in return than they were last year...all while still paying for housing in Manhattan. Not only does that seem unfair::: it also seems predatory; taking an already difficult set of circumstances for your students and families and responding by expecting your students and their families to pay more. Almost seems like it would make sense for many students to withdraw from 2020-21 completely and hopefully wait for a better/fairer plan from K-State for the 21-22 school year. 🤷‍♀️ We have always loved and supported K-State with our words::: $::: and degrees::: but this decision doesn't seem to line up with the emphasis K-State puts on being student and family-centered
.",K-State as an educator::: parent::: and someone who deeply believes in education...I want to say THANK YOU! You are doing a difficult and challenging job to meet the needs of so many people::: and our family truly appreciates all the thought and hard work you are putting forth to keep us all safe.,So we all know tuition also covers expenses for campus utilities::: property taxes::: etc. this is not right! You’re charging students for expenses while prohibiting them from using the campus as intended with full tuition that they’ve paid towards. How does this make any sense? If you need to heat::: cool::: power the lab::: pay for janitorial and other upkeep salaries and fees::: then open it all up! Otherwise::: steep discounts and figure your shortfall situation out by other means.,Colleges could care less about students::: it all comes down to the almighty dollars.,Menny Carmona,If I were a parent of a K-State student::: I would pull them out::: look for a local school that will be much cheaper or better still an online university that has been doing it a long time and send them there. Quit being taken advantage off so the university can keep raking in your dollars for who knows what! And don’t forget what they are doing to you and your kids when things are at a crisis in the entire nation::: because that is indicative of their character and morals!,"If my daughter enrolled in a class that was supposed to be on campus::: that later changed to online::: will she be assessed the online fee::: or not::: since she technically did not enroll in a distance/
Global Campus course?","I was charged an extra $630.00 in tuition because my daughters professors decided to go online rather than in class.

fTNVSVWkvS",I am very very disappointed in my alma mater - Kansas State University! I’m a bit behind - as I am just seeing my freshman daughters increase in fees. She had a crappy end to her senior year of high school. She was so excited to live the campus life and attend Kansas State University ... but now she is being charged almost $800 extra for online classes that she does NOT want. She is in tears! I do NOT understand why such a huge increase over something we have absolutely no control!,Doesn’t make any sense to make most classes online and charge additional fees. This will not make the campus any safer if all the students are coming to live in Manhattan and have hardly any face to face classes to attend. They will all be stuck in their dorms and Fraternity and Sorority houses full of students. If you do not feel it’s safe to have them go to classes...you shouldn’t be bringing them back to a small living assignment to work at their desk. Please make the right choices for the students and town.,My students did not choose the on line option... that was taken away from them for safety concerns. Please remove the on line fees::: greatly reduced or not::: there is nothing extra they are receiving on line that justifies this cost.,All of my classes::: which I am required to take this semester::: have been changed to online. I’ve already signed a lease. I am being charged $980 in online fees in addition to $770 in college fees. I am 18 years old and paying all of my own expenses. I do not have an extra $2:::500 for fees.,Hey anyone help me for get admission in This university please,Okay but if you read the article it first says tuition would be discounted for online::: then further down it says it's normal priced but with an $70 fee. Y'all aren't really cutting us any slack and that's MESSED up,Marlene Walter Demott Ally Demott,Jo Clarke George Clarke👍,Based on what I just read::: we will pay full price out of state tuition for classes (hybrid) that may be changed to online anytime during the semester. Access to campus facilities is also being reduced (libraries::: etc).

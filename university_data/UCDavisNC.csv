I remember truly enjoying his shows on campus and will forever love his incredible work. May he rest in peace. Thank you Mr. Thiebaud for your amazing work and for inspiring everyone with your gift of art. You will truly be missed.,He was a genius and will be missed.,It doesn't matter if you are or aren't an artist; let's all learn from Thiebaud and live a life of creativity::: passion::: and constant learning.

An important update about Winter Quarter 2022: Winter quarter will be remote January 3 -7::: 2022::: to allow enough time for student/faculty/employee testing before return. Below are a few highlights; to read the full update::: please visit: https://ucdavis.edu/news/chancellor-provost-update-winter-quarter  - We will open winter quarter remotely from January 3 -7::: allowing enough time for members of our community to secure a negative COVID-19 test before attending classes or coming to work in person on January 10.  - Although we had planned to discontinue the testing mandate for vaccinated people in mid-January::: we are now going to maintain our fall-quarter requirement: testing every two weeks for those people who are fully vaccinated and testing every four days for those people who are not vaccinated.  - We will enforce a system-wide mandate for a booster vaccine for all faculty::: staff::: and students who do not have a vaccine exemption currently in place.  For more::: please visit https://ucdavis.edu/news/chancellor-provost-update-winter-quarter,2021-12-22 00:33:04,Thank you::: UC Davis::: for your commitment to keep our community healthy!!,If you want to keep people safe::: why can't students get a quarantine room right now if they were exposed while waiting for a PCR test result? This request was denied just yesterday when students returned. The reply of the admin was basically if you test positive you get a quarantine room - after spending a night with other in the dorm? That is how you spread a virus fast and foster exponential growth.,LISTEN to the Disabled and Immunocompromis ed Community at UC Davis.

I thought I would walk across the stage with a degree on my hand not knowing what to do afterwards. It changed so suddenly::: so quick. I found my passion during college while I was figuring myself out. This passion turned it into a career. It was not easy. It took up countless sleepless nights trying to balance work and school. Something I learned throughout this time is that nothing will come to you easy. If you want it::: you have to work hard for it. If that means getting a couple hours of sleep to achieve the goal::: I would do it. I was never proud of my address. I grew up in a low-income family. I always wanted the finer things in life but I knew I could never have it. However::: I recently became financially independent and made 6 figures while being a student. Being in college helped shaped me to be the person I am today. It’s the professors::: my classmates::: the friends I made::: the organizations I joined. Thank you UC Davis for the amazing 3 years of my life. I would do it all over again in a heartbeat. 💗”  4: Celeste Gonzalez – “finally graduated with a B.S. in Managerial Economics! i’m the first in my family to go to college::: and while it was challenging to navigate on my own::: i wouldn’t trade this experience for the world”  5: rxchelanne – “Run yo own race don’t let nobody tell you different 💙 Did that in 3 years 🥳 Thank you Davis for all the memories::: the life long friends I’ve made and opportunities and experiences I’ve gained! 4ever thankful::: on to the next 🍾”  6: Dominique – “we got a uc davis graduate baby!! 🎓👑 so incredibly proud of my baby sister for graduating from college! now we’re both college graduates! can’t wait to watch the next part of your journey in becoming a doctor! i love you so much!📷 @d.aujah""  7: bengermin_ – “Too much to say in too little space.

Since Aggies are mooving to campus::: our beloved bovines are going to be getting a lot of new visitors. Here’s how to respectfully enjoy your visit while acknowledging the safety of the cows::: the UC Davis Dairy staff and yourself!  • The cows love visitors! Please only visit them during the day and take pictures with them from a distance.  • Please do not pet or feed the cows. Leave the feeding to the awesome @ucddairy team!  • Do not bring dogs near the Dairy Barn. There have been incidents of biting cows on the nose::: which is a safety and biosecurity hazard.  • Lastly::: the cows LOVE when you sing to them. Start thinking about what song you want to serenade them with during your next visit!  The cows are such a big part of our campus and we love them very much.

As the pandemic restrictions are lifted across the country::: people face returning to workplaces and pre-pandemic activities with a mixture of anxiety and elation. What are the psychological issues around going back to offices and mixing with people again? How will employers react to those who want to keep working from home? What does a new normal look like?  We address these questions with our two experts:  - Professor Angela Drake is a clinical neuropsychologist at UC Davis Health who treats adults with a wide range of neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions. She helps patients develop new behaviors::: thinking patterns and strategies to better manage stress and improve their quality of life and their relationships with others.  - Kimberly Elsbach is professor of management and holds the Steven G. Newberry Chair in Leadership at the UC Davis Graduate School of Management. She studies how people perceive each other and their organizations::: and how those perceptions affect their work.,2021-06-03 23:04:52,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two of our Eggheads on campus::: Yin & Yang::: are shown here with one of them lying on its ear with the back of its head toward the sculpture with the open mouth. DYK that a replica of Yin & Yang sits on the Embarcadero in San Francisco? Yin & Yang lend themselves to many photos and as being a background for performance art. 📷: randymsalo via Instagram,2021-04-27 03:15:02,The eggheads started being installed during my Junior and Senior years and I’ve come back and visited!,Yin and yang is the Chinese symbol of perfect balance. When something goes out of balance::: everything (matter::: energy::: and the likes of space)::: there is a pressure to find the new equilibrium or in other words::: new balance. It's a highly significant symbol,are these by the theatre and music departments? I always assumed they were comedy and tragedy,Weren’t they removed from the Embarcadero in 2013?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A statement from Chancellor May on the tragic killing of Duante Wright and a reminder to our community of the available resources.  UCDAVIS.EDU Statement from UC Davis Chancellor Gary S. May on the Tragic Killing of Daunte Wright  Chancellor May April 13::: 2021 at 8:58 PM ·  In quantum mechanics::: Schrödinger's cat is a thought experiment that illustrates an apparent paradox of quantum superposition. In the thought experiment::: a hypothetical cat may be considered simultaneously both alive and dead as a result of being linked to a random subatomic event that may or may not occur (Wikipedia).  As a black man in America::: I often feel like Schrödinger's cat: I exist in an uncertain state that can be simultaneously considered both alive and dead::: subject only to a potential random interaction with an incompetent/fallible/malicious law enforcement officer that may or may not occur. It’s exhausting.  Nevertheless::: I fully support President Drake’s statement [https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/uc-statement-tragic-killing-daunte-wright]. While the nation watches the Derek Chauvin trial and waits for the outcome::: we now have to come to terms with the death of Daunte Wright::: a young man whose son will grow up without his father. No matter the circumstances surrounding this incident::: Mr. Wright did not need to die.  In times like this::: it’s easy to feel hurt::: frustrated::: angry and exhausted. I understand. Many of us felt those emotions last summer and many times before that. I once again urge you to get support if you need it.  If you are a student in need of mental health resources::: contact https://shcs.ucdavis.edu/services/counseling-services. If you are faculty or staff::: contact https://hr.ucdavis.edu/departments/asap. We also have racial trauma resources.

"Up next in our ""Aggies in Love"" series - meet Lamar and Pui San.  ""I was reading The California Aggie newspaper and decided to reach out to one of the Tuesday columnists on page 2 to comment on his story. The column was called 'Born Loser?' and the columnist usually wrote funny stories about working at Safeway and never having a date! The story I reached out to him about was actually a bit somber — his grandmother had died. I wrote to him to say 'sorry your grandmother died.' We ended up meeting up at the MU flagpole and went to eat at Ali Baba’s right off campus. He called it our first date::: but I had no interest in him — I was just being friendly to the 'Born Loser'!”  You never know what will happen when you reach out to your local columnist!",2021-02-13 05:00:20,Amazing! My husband and I agree his column was one we always looked forward to when we were in college. Such a great story!,A small world indeed! Pui San was a classmate and I bumped into Lamar once or twice in the North Davis Safeway. Also::: loved reading his column.,Time to rename the column “Born winner”. Congrats my fellow aggies!,I worked with this guy at Safeway as a courtesy clerk and checker::: 1999-2002! I even have some pictures of him selling me my first official alcohol purchase. It’s good to see where some of my fellow Aggies have ended up. And yes::: it was very difficult to have a social life when you were scheduled 8p-12a because you were lowest on the seniority list!,Maybe you should bring back the column Lamar!,Lol who would have thought? Now two kids later and so many adventures! So blessed to call you both my friends! Love you Pui San and Lamar!!,We both worked at Safeway too!? Didn’t realize that...love it.,I loved reading that column!,Lamar Heystek!! I loved your column during college! Didn’t he do a comic in the Aggie as well?,Neat story Lamar! You were always there on my late night jaunts to Safeway.,Lamar’s weekly columns were a must read in The California Aggie! 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽,🙏👏🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀,Amazing story...I love it!,Priscilla Ohnmacht,Oh my goodness! ❤💜❤ Lamar Heystek !!!,Anna Bahar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

UCD will always have a special place in our heart,My wife and I met in the Cal Aggie Band-uh! in 2003. She a freshman::: I a sophomore.

We married the summer before our senior year and celebrated our 47th anniversary last July.,My husband and I met in the Tercero dorms::: he was in the room across from mine! Fell in love playing Rock Band in the common room!,My husband and I met taking a theater class in Wyatt Pavilion in Fall 2005::: started both working tech on a modern dance show in January 2006 and hit it off at a cast party. We officially became a couple on a picnic date in the arboretum a few days before Valentine’s Day because I had a late evening O-chem lab on the actual day. Next Fri will be 15 years together::: we will be married 9 years this June::: and we have 2 kids,My husband and I walked the arboretum in our first date. He chased me down on his bike to ask me out 😂,My wife and I met as freshmen in Tercero M and started dating towards the end of the year. We took our engagement photos outside the M building and the arboretum. We took our maternity pictures at the arboretum as well. We hope our daughter will be a third generation Aggie 💙💛,There is some debate about where exactly on campus we met::: perhaps the parking lot by Segundo (not there anymore) while meeting up with a group of mutual friends to go dancing. The falling in love probably happened at the Rec Pool::: sitting in the grass talking. It was Spring of 1995::: been married 22 years. Tim Mangum,My boyfriend and I met four years ago in the Sciences Lab building when I picked him to be my chemistry 2a lab partner. He looked smart what can I say 💁‍♀️,My wife and I met our freshman year. Our first date was at the ARC Starbucks just about 10 years ago! We just welcomed our first baby this year::: possibly Aggie class of 2042...,I worked at The Wherehouse across from campus (long gone::: now a Trader Joe's?)::: and Pattie asked for a movie recommendation. She returned a few days later to yell at me for recommending a horrible movie. I had never seen it and was just going off what was popular (don't remember what it was). Found out her boyfriend at the time and I had the same major::: so I'd come over to study. We were friends for years before finally dating: married 20 years. 🙂,My wife and I met in 2004 at the L building in Tercero as freshmen. I was utterly smitten with her and officially and secretly (LOL) got together a few months later. Our first real date was at Ciocolat in downtown. A decade later::: she proposed to me at the arboretum and I proposed to her at the quad. We got married in 2016 and mothered a total of 7 pups together. Our UCD love story will always be my favorite. 💙💛,My husband and I were SOCs for Tercero dorms our sophomore year. We were attending training and he thought I was smiling at him when I was smiling at the guy behind him. Needless to say he was persistent and we’ve been married for 28 years.,I met my boyfriend at Tercero dining commons::: a few weeks after moving into the dorms over 5 years ago. He came up to me when I was sitting alone at an early dinner on a Saturday night::: and asked if I was waiting for anyone / if he could sit with me. I *was* actually waiting for friends::: but he was cute so I lied! We’ve been together ever since 🥲,Met online::: but our 1st date was at Sudwerks and then we went to the arboretum for a walk.,My husband and I met at The Grad! Both of us are now alums💛💙 I was on the UCD gymnastics team and he is a US Marine!

Class of 2011. We quickly became best friends and both worked for Unitrans as a Road Supervisor/ Driver and Conductor/ Conductor Manager and became Co-trombone Section leaders for the Band-uh! for our Junior/Senior years. In 2018::: I finally came out of the closet and we got married in October of 2019,My husband and I met my junior year at UC Davis when we both worked at the UC Davis Youth Programs. Though we were just friends at the time::: we stayed in contact and when we both happened to move to Oakland::: CA::: we began dating. Fast foreward 11 years::: we are now married::: living and teaching in Memphis::: and expecting our first baby in May. (No we are not naming him Gunrock),My wife and I met frosh year in 2000 in Primero Grove; we were one of the lucky ones outside of campus housing. I’d like to say it was love at first sight::: which it was::: but she had a boyfriend at the time. Fast forward a year or two and we started to end up at the same parties with the same people (I.e. living in colleges::: then temescal). Anyway dated jr and sr year and the rest is history with 2 kids and 15 yrs of marriage! Don’t break up parties Davis police 😆,My husband I met while taking a Religious Studies class::: the Gospel of John class in 1997. We were also in a discussion section together.

A water tower on our main campus fades into the heavy fog of the day.,2021-01-15 19:35:04,Loved my time at Davis but this time of the year sucks. I remember coming down the highway from Sac and exited to take 113 and I could no see an inch infront of my car::: felt like I was driving off a plane into the clouds.,Tule fog.

"""At UC Davis::: we value a culture of mutual respect. Let’s continue to take care of one another::: knowing that::: as always::: we will get through this — together:::"" said Chancellor May.  Chancellor May January 6::: 2021 at 6:16 PM ·  It’s a sad day in America.  It didn’t start out that way::: though. I awoke this morning and went for my run::: buoyed by the thoughtful reflection shared by newly elected Georgia Senator Raphael Warnock::: who said that the hands of his 82-year-old mother that were once “used to pick somebody else’s cotton” were just used to vote for the first African American senator in the history his state. I lived much of my adult life in the state of Georgia::: and although I do not know Reverend Warnock personally::: I have attended several services in Ebenezer Baptist Church::: where he is pastor and Martin Luther King Jr. once was. I always enjoyed his sermons and was uplifted by the progress his story represented.  That was this morning. By the time I finished my monthly UC Council of Chancellors Zoom call this afternoon::: the day had taken a darker turn. The images we’ve seen of Washington::: D.C.::: today are difficult to reconcile. We all denounce the abhorrent behavior of the insurrectionists who breached our nation’s Capitol. The inexplicable leniency shown by law enforcement toward these seditionists was not lost on me as well and stood in stark contrast to the treatment of peaceful protesters in Lafayette Square just weeks ago.  Our democracy is a 244-year-old institution that we build upon daily by participation::: debate::: peaceful protest::: and advocating for the initiatives and change we believe in. Sometimes our views will prevail::: sometimes they will not. Yet violence is never the answer to address our grievances. We must rely on our shared values and the principles of democracy that we hold dear.  While it is indeed a sad day::: we’re reminded today of how important it is to recommit to these ideals and to peacefully pursue solutions to our nation’s challenges. At UC Davis::: we value a culture of mutual respect. Let’s continue to take care of one another::: knowing that::: as always::: we will get through this — together.  https://www.ucdavis.edu/news/statement-uc-davis-chancellor-gary-s-may-community",2021-01-07 02:35:50,Well said Chancellor!,Thank you Chancellor May for your words and leadership!,thank you for those thoughtful words,Well said.

In the spring of 1945::: after months of rooting out Nazis from high ridges in the Italian Alps::: 2nd Lt. Milton Hildebrand — executive officer (XO) of his company in the 10th Mountain Division — crossed the fabled Po River. As the Germans retreated::: news of the Americans’ arrival spread like wildfire across the villages of the Po Valley::: and Italians thronged the roadway — waving; singing; throwing flowers; passing out wine::: cookies and cheese; stretching out their hands to touch the passing soldiers and shouting: “Viva::: viva gli Americani!” #VeteransDay  Read more about the incredible life of our professor emeritus of zoology whose life story hadn't been told before.

Thank you for your service Professor Hildebrand,Fabulous article! Thank you for your service!,Great school & staff.,This Army brat is amazed to learn this history of my professor in the 1970s!

In California::: 40 percent of greenhouse gas emissions comes from transportation. Emissions from this sector will make it difficult to meet the state’s 2030 climate goals. There is a myriad of solutions: electric vehicles::: public transportation::: ride share::: e-scooters and more. But people’s behaviors and habits as well as bad land-use planning make this one of the most difficult sectors to decarbonize. In this episode of Unfold::: we’ll look at how we can transition to low-carbon transportation.,2020-11-10 21:52:54,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"For thousands of years::: the land on which our campus is located has been the home of Patwin people. Today::: there are three federally recognized Patwin tribes: Cachil DeHe Band of Wintun Indians of the Colusa Indian Community::: Kletsel Dehe Wintun Nation::: and Yocha Dehe Wintun Nation. The Patwin people have remained committed to the stewardship of this land over many centuries. This campus is Patwin land and remains an important part of Patwin heritage and identity.  Indigenous Peoples’ Day celebrates the beauty::: strength::: and joy of Indigenous peoples of the Americas::: past and present. Indigenous Peoples’ Day acknowledges the rich and diverse histories of Native American people and renounces the false narrative that Columbus’ discovered America. We ask you to join us in uplifting Native voices and peoples::: today and everyday.  The Native American Contemplative Garden in the UC Davis Arboretum and Public Garden was developed with Patwin Elder Bill Wright and his family and honors the Patwin ancestors who lived on this land. It offers encouragement to American Indian students::: telling them that they belong here::: that they belong in higher education -\-\ and they can say::: ""I'm a part of this.""  #IndigenousPeoplesDay  Resources: - Follow the Native American Academic Student Success Center The Native Nest - Support students by giving to the Native American Retention Initiative (NARI) link in bio. https://give.ucdavis.edu/VCSA/SNARI06?fbclid=IwAR1TEL69Y2bdT3iIkz1AqAVfmzc1R3gD04C3ezYi65pc1w5T9oXhj_K2igU",2020-10-12 19:55:28,🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aggies - it's going to take all of us working together. Bookmark the Student FAQ page on Campus Ready website below in UC Davis Life's post.,2020-09-10 00:11:08,*take.,Subject: COVID-19 safety: I hope the numerous needs can met well before the start in person learning. Some of the materials and staffing will be difficult to obtain and achieve if they are not addressed now.  COVID-19 safety: Will there be an adequate supply of alcohol based sanitizer? There will be a need for a lot for everyone just to get started. Some students will need more access to wash their hands as they are too sensitive to the alcohol based sanitizers. Will there be multiple touch free thermometers for staff to use to check temperatures? Are all students entering building via one set of doors? Will students be tested as they enter with a larger thermal scanning unit? Students and staff should also be cautioned against masking fevers with medication. Are parents going to be barred from campus to minimize exposure at drop off and pick up in the dorms? Masks ready available to all. Will there be more gloves in multiple sizes? Will the nurse's be maintained at a high staffing level? On that note::: there will likely be a need for a quarantine waiting to be picked up room. Restrooms are a major hazard because toilets disperse aerosols. Toilet lids are needed and there will be a need to teach the students to use them. Restrooms will need to be sprayed down during the day on a check off schedule. Drinking fountains will also need to be cleaned multiple times a day. There will be a need for a lot more garbage bags. They will need to be replaced daily. There will be a need more facial tissue so the students can be encouraged use them. Obviously::: there will be a need for a lot more soap and paper towels. Is there a way to plumb for warm water? Before this the latest research actually showed that cold was fine::: but this virus is better killed with warm water. Also some of the people do not wash long because the water is so cold. Some schools have very cold well water. Common equipment sanitation::: how and how frequently will that be done? Will there be substitutes for professors if the are out for two weeks? HVAC filters will need to be changed more often than every three months or a year. They will need to be changed and cleaned monthly. Will better plexiglas sneeze guards be installed in the cafeteria food serving area? Can there be more elbow room for the students at lunch? They sit shoulder to shoulder in the cafeteria. Classrooms need open windows to ventilate. And ventilate the room during staff meetings to dilute possible exposure or Zoom from individual classrooms or offices. Reduce class sizes for better social distancing. Full time medical staff to check and monitor student and staff health. More custodial staffing to properly sanitize rooms. This is additional work that needs more aloted time. Touch free hand sanitizer stations to help mitigate viral transmission. HEPA air filters especially for rooms where students have difficulty or cannot wear masks.,Angel Perez,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Would have been nice to have back in 2017 after I racked up literally over $1:::400 in parking fees as a broke student simply trying to commute there to get my education. And when I tried to settle the situation TAPS was extremely rude::: nonchalant and threatened to boot my car. Not to mention the hold you guys put on my registration after I graduated which literally prevented me from driving to work so I could earn the money to pay the fees back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sirs:::
We want to use this opportunity::: to first of all commend the International community::: for its efforts to criticize Nigerian Fulani Government actions against Biafran agitators::: and other oppressed people in the country.

Nigerian successive Governments::: have been committing all manner of atrocities and suppression of people of Biafra::: since the so-called independence about sixty years ago. The systematic genocide::: slavery::: and inhuman treatment::: meted out to our people have surpassed those of any oppressed group of people in the world. Hence::: we have been agitating for self-determinat
ion::: which has spanned more than 54 years.

The Nigeria-Biafra civil war which lasted for 30 months ended in January 1970. Successive Hausa/Fulani regimes have continued to repress and exclude our people in the scheme of things. Their wickedness and incessant killing of our people::: have revived our resolve for restoration of State of Biafra. That is the only way out of this internal slavery and local imperialism. We are not compatible at all with our oppressors; to warrant living together in one country.

Now::: we beseech the world bodies including United Nations and United States of America::: not to supply weapons to Nigerian Authorities::: under any pretence. Do not send money or any material help to them either; ostensibly to fight terrorism. Most of the ammunition and cash donations::: end up in the hands of terrorists they themselves sponsor. Many of the successful ambushes laid against soldiers::: and capture of military equipments and money::: are pre-arranged. They are now paying salaries::: and housing the insurgents under fake amnesty.

Highly placed persons in Nigerian Government::: and other Northern elite::: finance the activities of: Boko Haram::: ISWAP::: bandits::: name them. This is part of the grand plan to take over Nigeria. They want to conquer::: take over lands in Biafra::: and other Southern and Middle Belt areas::: as Fulani settlements.

It is hypocritical for Nigerian Authorities::: to claim they are fighting insurgency and banditry; and at the same time indirectly arming::: and giving money running into hundreds of millions of dollars::: to those criminals. Thousands of non-Fulanis are being killed every month in the country. In Katsina and Zamfara States for example::: the Fulani bandits are massacring the Hausas on daily basis. And little or nothing is being done about it.

Terrorism and banditry in Nigeria::: can never be stopped by the supplies of weapons::: and donations from any quarter to the Government. They end up equipping and enriching those armed groups. Many of those armed gangs are on the pay roll of Nigerian Government and Northern elite. The much talked about repentant terrorists::: are being placed on jumbo salaries (as much as #100:::000 a month); far above the civil service structure::: from borrowed loans with interests accumulating. Imagine idle illiterates earning more than University professors::: lecturers::: doctors and others::: who are even owed several months of meager pay.

All those labeled repentant terrorists have never confessed their evil deeds for one day. Have they given any information on the location of heavy equipments like armoured cars they captured? Has any of those pretenders::: given insight concerning the whereabouts of multitude of adopted people::: including women and children? Why do they go back to their old lives of kidnapping and banditry? They are all scammers. They and their financers are taking the rest of the country for a ride. These miscreants are promptly absorbed into the armed forces to carry on with their jihadist agenda. Our taskmasters are desperate to make Nigeria Islamic Caliphate. Religious hypocrites.

Miyetty Allah- organization in charge of Fulani Herdsmen::: boasted that United Nations is on its side. This quickly reminds us of UN Under-Secretary
General::: who is a Fulani woman::: from Nigeria. She was allowed to resign her position as a Minister in Buhari’s cabinet; to pick up that job to protect Fulani interest there. Since her assumption of office::: UN has been very passive and adamant to atrocities and heinous crimes::: being committed by Fulani rulers and terrorists::: ravaging the country with impunity. She has never for one day::: uttered a word against the evils going on in Nigeria. We therefore call for her removal from that position::: due to her partisan stance against the rest people in the country. Despite all their atrocities::: Fulanis are not being tried and convicted of any crime. You can hardly get any Fulani in prison. He can not be detained for long. Once order comes from ‘above:::’ they will be left off the hook::: even if they killed people.

Why is it that international Community::: and World Powers including United States and Russia::: have kept quiet over the foreign impostors ruling over Nigeria since the year 2017? The hypocrisy and nonchallant attitude of these bodies::: have left much to be desired. They should carry out thorough investigation::: arrest all culprits and collaborators::: and prosecute them in world court and ICC. Why should they allow foreigners who impersonate a dead ruler to plunder the country::: and leave when they deem fit? They keep on diverting the country’s resources and money to develop neighbouring Niger Republic. They continue to borrow money from international financial institutions::: and creditor countries including China. They borrow and loot. They want to ground the country before absconding. Now::: about 91 percent of the budget is used in debt servicing_ to pay interest on loans. International Community needs to stop lending money to these people: because they part with bulk of the money: thereby plunging the country into perpetual bankruptcy.

We finally call on United Nations and its allies::: to promptly organize referendum for people of Biafra. And follow it up with declaration of sovereign state of Biafra. It is a long overdue.

Yours Sincerely
Evangelist Joseph U. Afurobi. https://

Who is left to be vaccinated against COVID-19::: and why is it the toughest task yet?",11/10/2021 14:34,The mask 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂,Libtards love. Lol,Covid has to be the smartest virus on the planet. It's cured influenza and the cold. Influenza wasn't smart enough to get around the mask but covid figured that rascal mask out. This covid virus with a 0.008 % mortality rate has figured out how to get you sicker than all the other viruses. It's so smart that vaccines don't keep the vaccinated covid free. It's so smart it fools the covid test with false positives and false negatives,Because it’s poison.,The real purpose of this vaccination is to depopulate the earth. Why do you think they aren’t vaccinating the illegal immigrants who cross our borders ? They are keeping them safe to replace those who they’re able to kill with the vaccine. And they’re paying them for getting separated at the border even though they don’t belong here because they didn’t come here legally.,No thanks!!,Really? That is why I haven't been vaccinated? I thought the reason I didn't get vaccinated was because I don't want to. I'm willing to take my chances with covid is why. I never got a day off never got a handout so getting vaccinated will do nothing for me except possibly make me feel crappy for a couple of days. It isn't going to benefit me in any shape. Unless the government is going to give me 20 grand and reduce my income tax by 10 percent for life I see no reason for it. (The 20 grand is to reimburse me for my savings I have had to spend the last 6 months because of inflation and zero help from government to handle it) the 10 percent tax break is to cover cost of continued price hikes. It's really simple if my government wants me vaccinated then step up and give me a person who worked all thru the pandemic the same thing you gave everyone who didn't work. I have even lost two weeks of vacation because we were to short handed for me to take the time off and if it isn't used it's lost at end of year,"Hey guys!

I hope intelligent people here realize that ""forced"" or mandatory vaccinations happened routinely in this country for other diseases::: even when the numbers were low and mortality rates low as well. From the 19th century onward::: children have to be vaccinated against most diseases in order to go to school. From birth until the age of 18::: the vast majority of people are vaccinated against 16 diseases.

I got the sickness…right before I was allowed to get the vaccine. Then I got the vaccine too.

So I’m doubly immunized. And yeah…immunity might fade…but honestly…I’m not getting another shot.

(Not all of the reasons listed)

#1. Remember when Biden::: Harris::: Cuomo::: and other politicians said publicly::: while Trump was still president::: that they would not be getting the vaccine. They claimed they don't trust Trump::: they didn't trust it being rushed::: lack of testing::: and even not trusting the CDC.

#2. The bribery behind getting it. Money::: hamburgers::: donuts::: college tuition::: among other things::: just to get jabbed.

#3. The push for working people to get it to keep their job but I've never heard the push for persons on welfare/
government assistance to get it keep their income.

#4. If masks work so well::: since they are essential enough to wear all the time. Why can't we just wear a mask instead of getting the jab? Just wearing a mask was good enough for healthcare workers in 2020. Some had to reuse masks and other PPE for days.

#5. The fact that the manufacturers of the ""vaccines"" are immune from legal actions against them for side effects.

#6.. Vaccinated individuals can still get COVID::: spread COVID::: die from COVID::: and even die from side effects of the vaccine.
Unvaccinated individuals can do all of those things::: except die from the vaccine side effects.

#6. Humans have an immune system for a reason. Our immune systems get weak when we filter out all the bacteria from cleaning::: wearing a mask::: and social distancing. We need exposure to bacteria.

People die everyday.

It is interesting to see that they no longer hide that they use Marxist strategies. And that they want to dissuade the population by turning family members into ""Commisars"" of the Pharmaceutical cartel.

This looks like socialist propaganda to me

""The upcoming holidays will likely bring together family members with differing beliefs when it comes to the coronavirus pandemic and vaccines. Zimmerman offers a few tips for respectful dialogue including:

Know that it’s unlikely that you will change their view. That mindset removes the win-lose dynamic and puts you in a better position to make a difference.
Talk one-on-one instead of in a large group where a person might feel singled out and thus attacked.
Ask questions to understand how / why they have come to their particular viewpoint and be silent long enough to really hear their perspective.
Briefly share an anecdote that may sway them::: like noting a healthy person you know who died of COVID-19 or explaining what led you to get vaccinated.
Find another person who that individual trusts and encourage them to discuss their concerns with them. """" ""

Search other adverse effects from them if you want. Don't you dare tell me these vaccines are safe. If you got one thank God you're ok. Denmark Iceland Sweden and Finland banned Moderna. Germany Italy France banned Astrazenaca. Stop letting people control us. Stop letting these clowns be in charge. RESIST.

ne",God gave me a immune system when I was born and it is still working just fine. Don't need a shot for something that doesn't exist,When one experiences fear::: the prefontal cortex (rationing logic critical thinking brain) shuts down and they operate from the limbic system which is the fight fight faint freeze control their surroundings and control others around them part of the brain. This happens on the subconscious level but they think they are thinking::: but someone just offered them the solution to their fear so they take the solution right in despite the brain being shut down. The brain literally becomes incapacitated of thinking clearly. This is neurologic physiologic and anatomic fact::: research every bit of it. So no there's zero chance a vast majority are getting a medical experiment injected into their bodies (with plenty of evidence that's it's incredibly harmful) which was developed from people living in fear with their brains shut down. And forced upon people::: from leaders/people in fear.,So let me get this straight. You know that the shot and the mask don't work. It doesn't stop you from getting it or spreading it to others::: yet you won't hold yourselves or your company responsible for the deaths and side effectt. The antibodies created by the vaccine die within a month::: (hence the boosters needed already) yet you don't follow your own research nor admit that you doctored the death numbers and underlying conditions of patients. You lied about the lethality of it::: you lied about how long it would be around::: and are now trying to force people to get it because you realise how bad you screwed the pooch::: and don't want to go down looking like an idiot? Way too late for that. I'll take my 99.8% chances.,Just everybody remember. The FULLY vaccinated still GET AND SPREAD COVID. So if it obviously doesn't work why you want to force everybody to get an experimental injection into their body??? Me and mine will never be vaccinated. Any forceful attempt to do so I will consider to be a threat on our lives and I will act accordingly.,Pathetic,You aren’t convincing anyone. Who cares at this point? If they are old and unvaccinated just let them die. Thin the herd. COVID straight up doesn’t matter anymore. We’ve done what we can. If people haven’t gotten vaccinated by this point they aren’t ever going to. This is a fact.,Blah blah blah,I'm not getting it. Too much bs surrounding it. Its been way to politicized. Plus among the numerous other reasons. I have an immune system and I trust it and it works just peachy.,We have made our decision it is not happening get that through your heads,How about don’t worry about my body it’s my choice leave us the hell alone. For those people who file a religious exemption and are denied that’s discrimination against religion which is against the law. I have more faith in God than I do in man.,"Efficacy has shown to falter after a certain amount of time and those elderly pt with the vaccines are dying of covid before having ability to get 3rd dose or before 3rf dose takes affect...spread

It’s their right and their choice.
Once that happens they are fully protected and shouldn’t worry about anyone who makes a different choice.",Persuasion or bullying? 🤔,Seeing as how I’ve already had the covid and it was terrible but I recovered and been exposed to it I don’t even know how many times ::: and haven’t had more than a common cold since then I feel pretty safe and secure . But we don’t believe in natural immunity in this comment thread ::: natural immunity is a myth ::: like North Dakota . It must just be coincidence that it’s protecting me . Can’t have any sort of scientific basis behind it or anything .

People will have to get booster shots every 6 months::: which is crazy. And::: lots of fully vaccinated people are still getting and spreading the virus and even dying from it. Plus::: we have effective therapeutics and treatments available to treat people who get it. And let's not forget those who have natural immunity::: which is and always has been the gold standard. So stop with with this nonsense and fear-mongering.,Amazing how stupid our universities have become. Thanks but NO thanks!,My body my choice !!!!!!,Everyone must be tracked down and vaccinated because natural immunity is a myth. Natural immunity is not “science”::: so roll up those sleeves and stop trying to think too much or use logic! Just do what your told and follow the crowd!! The vaccine is so effective that it only works if 100% of the population gets the shot 🥴,Blind date love 😎,Standard post from a university. Pfft.,Eric Baker,#clotshot,This is not it chief. Still time to delete this,Why do you guys want everyone to be vaccinated? Who’s paying you?,I will not get anything that was created while Trump was in office he's trying to kill us,Clearly the unvaccinated adults have made their decision (hopefully with the help of their personal physician) not to vaccinate. You can't force this decision on anyone.,It's the toughest task bc only the smart people havent gotten it yet. U can't convince people that think for themselves to do dumb things bc u say too,"Read this guy's obituary.

Me neither,Thank goodness my child passed on this woke school,Pat Mullins Gallagher,Not a chance in hell!,So I'll admit that I stopped reading after Inital few paragraphs::: unbelievable how condescending and belitting this article is. Keep speaking to you vaccinated elites. Unreal.,Probably because no data shows that it is any better then natural immunity. It doesn't lower the chance of catching it spreading covid. Those have been said by each company that makes the vaccine::: the cdc and the WHO. We are now seeing more and more people having major health issues because of the vaccine. Repeating the past::: look up the 1976 swine flu vaccine that the cdc covered up that the vaccine was causing neurological issues and many others. We are seeing it with this vaccine now.,I find it real cute that all the anti-vaxxers are arguing with a medical schools Facebook page as if they know more than doctors.,I’m not I won’t. I’ve had Covid. Everything I have ever learned is about building up immunity. Not just taking meds and getting shots. Stop forcing it.,So since Congress made it so the people with adverse reaction cannot sue the Mfg. of the shot will UofM Cover others medical cost and loss of life function cost since you are pushing the shot?,Go Brady Go. Read “Let’s Blow-Up Now” at my-tribute.net::: search for Donzo.,More people going into the hospital after being vaccinated over people who don't have the vaccine cause they have herd immunity::: my body my choice and it doesn't make me a second class citizen either or are we suddenly forming the Gestapo to force people to get vaccinated.,Garret Steven Halkides,"Seriously question::: what other vaccine has to ""run its course""",#fjb,Unfollow.,#fjb,No reason to take a vaccine that don't work,I think the main reason is it isn't a vaccine,"The issue is that there are risks with the vaccine and risks without::: but the differential in human cognitive terms isn't significant enough for widespread agreement. For example::: a disease that kills 30% of the infected population and a notable % of the total population would probably convince a lot more people to get a vaccine- even a harsh one - than a disease that kills less 3% of known infected people and almost 0% of the total population.

What we have here is the latter with a vaccine that makes enough people sick with side effects::: even if they're ""just"" a fatigue::: fever::: aches::: etc.::: that last long enough and with enough personal and economic impact to make the risk-reward paradigm a lot less attractive.

Even when someone says the chances of dying from the vaccine is X% lower than the disease::: you're already starting with a total mortality rate that rounds to 0.00%::: so saying you're 50% less likely to die than almost 0% (on a total population basis::: not individual risk basis) is not particularly moving.

Meanwhile::: the people who need the vaccine the least are the most likely to suffer side effects. It's not the elderly and infirm who get put down hard by inflammatory symptoms from the vaccine. It's the young and healthy who have the lowest probability of issues with the disease in the first place.

So there we have a problem::: too. We are asking people who need it the least to do the most suffering::: or - at minimum - to risk it.

If you don't start addressing those realities::: or at least start acknowledging them::: then you're not actually accomplishing anything but to deepen the divide.",Because we live in a free country and no one should be forced to do something they don't want!!!

Good luck with that::: you redcoats.,Nope. We do better with our own.,We are consistently told to get the shot for everyone. Fact: one can still transmit covid to others even after vaccination.

The shot protects exactly one person. YOU! FYI I have been vaccinated.

GEORGE WASHINGTON
Deemed the greatest man in the world by everyone
⁠
George Washington was famous for his humility::: and was revered as the ""Greatest Man in the World"" during his timeline according to scholars::: noblemen::: commoners::: and even the King of Britain whom he defeated in battle. He was also the most famous celebrity throughout the world causing people to line-up throughout the countryside just to see him ride past on his horse.
⁠
What the 400 British ships didn't see when they sailed into New York Harbor to defeat George Washington and his ""ragtag"" untrained Continental Army who were fighting for their independence from England's taxes and laws::: was Washington's faith in God and his humility ― the latter being his most noted characteristic of which people wrote about in their letters and diaries.
⁠
Even the other founding fathers agreed that George Washington was the best of them all::: a man with no formal education.
⁠
After Washington defeated King George III and his army after eight straight years of battling::: the King acknowledged Washington as being the best man in the world for turning down the opportunity to be ordained King (as many people wanted to see happen)::: and also for handing his devoted army back to the Congress which had never before then been done by a winning war General in order for him to return back to his farm and live out the rest of his life privately at his home although later::: he would be pressured to become the first President of the United States of America in order to continue spreading his noble::: wise and humbling influence.
⁠
Washington's army in theory::: should never have won the War for Independence (also called the Revolutionary War)::: but they did even though at times twenty-percent of the army went without shoes or clothing having to endure hot and freezing conditions including walking barefoot through frozen lakes::: cutting their feet on rocks::: and having only to eat ""firecake"" at times which is flour mixed water prepared in a kettle over fire thus causing many of them to die from starvation and disease when Washington somehow never got sick like the others did.

Over the years::: his army came to believe that Washington survived gunfire and disease because he was ordained by a higher-order like when a thick-mist appeared from nowhere blocking out everything in sight allowing the Continental army to escape an attack so they could regroup and strategize.
⁠
George Washington freed all his slaves before he died::: some of them had been inherited from his father during times when even African people were selling their poorest and least educated people under the justification that they weren’t like humans::: because they were primitive in culture and tradition.
⁠
It’s unfortunate that Washington::: and all the other good people couldn’t have afforded to purchase all the slaves and give them dignified jobs::: beautiful places to live::: and an educations like many did::: but there were about four million slaves in the end and nobody was rich enough to purchase them all::: especially after the invention of the Cotton Gin which rose America to being the producer of about three quarters of the world’s cotton.

This amassed some of the biggest fortunes during those times which caused many evil and greedy people to raise the price of slaves to 7 or 8 times higher AND it also posed more danger to slaves overall when talking about abolishing slavery during a time when the people making fortunes from it were never more power hungry who would rather see the slaves killed than become free as proven when they hunted down slaves after they were freed.
⁠
Washington's great friend Billy Lee was a black slave that Washington purchased and saved from a potentially horrible fate.
Billy Lee::: rode aside Washington for the 8-years they fought together as a best man and friend.
⁠
Fritz Hirschfeld a historian wrote that::: ""If Billy Lee had been a white man he would have had an honored place in American history because of his close proximity to George Washington during the most exciting periods of his career. But because he was a black servant::: a humble slave::: he has been virtually ignored by both black and white historians and biographers.”
⁠
George Washington::: top scholars::: innovators::: and the founding father’s who worked on developing the U.S. Constitution knew that the Constitution was better than them selves::: and that it was the best attempt to give power to the people NOT the evil that will ALWAYS find itself employed in government.
⁠
They all knew the slaves must be freed for the Constitution to become all that it was written to be::: but knew a gradual approach to freeing the slaves was the best way to protect them from being killed::: and to plan for their integration into society as free and equal people.

Many Africans came to America of their free will settling first in Portland::: the melting post of vast religions::: languages::: and foreign cultures getting along together and excited to be living and exploring the ""new world"" of which they didn't originally know was already inhabited by hundreds of Indian tribes::: some unfriendly like the Shawnee who captured and tortured one of Daniel Boone's sons to death::: and were known for scalping the much different looking foreigners.

Many of the tribes were friendly and showed the foreigners how to grow food and navigate through the uncharted and dangerous terrain::: some of them even partnered with the British by guiding them through forestry during the war.

Washington called the Constitution “The Great Experiment” and I personally believe it is worth dying for::: just like our Bible is and ancient history which have been removed from public education.⁠
⁠
GEORGE WASHINGTON QUOTES:⁠
⁠
“The fate of unborn millions will now depend::: under God::: on the conduct and courage of this army.”⁠
⁠
To be prepared for war is one of the most effective means of preserving peace.”
⁠
“Government is not reason and it is not eloquence. It is force! Like fire it is a dangerous servant and a fearful master. Never for a moment should it be left to irresponsible action.”
⁠
“It should be the highest ambition of every American to extend his views beyond himself::: and to bear in mind that his conduct will not only affect himself::: his country::: and his immediate posterity; but that its influence may be co-extensive with the world::: and stamp political happiness or misery on ages yet unborn.”
⁠
“The time is near at hand which must determine whether Americans are to be fre",BS. What did you do::: U of M::: only interview Democrats?,Did you ask five black people? Because the percentage of vaccinated by demographic in the vast majority of States shown the black community disagrees with your poll.,What about the pregnant women who work in healthcare? Just going to make them get the shot and hope it doesn’t cause any problems like miscarriage::: Down’s syndrome::: or other birth defects? I guess they could just quit or be fired. Really nice thing to put an expecting mother through.,Im not defending or offending the vaccine.. but going out and polling a hyper specific and predetermined bias group of people and using their data in a way so as to create an idea of representation of the whole... is just plain wrong and misinformation,Here's the thing...health care workers also deserve that all pple they treat get the shot unless there is a valid medical reason not to.,I doubt it.

Next::: we play Mambo (from West Side Story) and New York/Empire State of Mind::: an evocation of the energy::: life::: compassion::: love::: and strength of the “city that never sleeps.“ We transition to Who Lives::: Who Dies::: Who Tells Your Story::: which memorializes those who lost their lives while commemorating the unity and strength of the American people. Our performance concludes with a medley of This Land Is Your Land and Stars and Stripes Forever.

After registering::: you will receive a confirmation email about joining the webinar.",8/19/2021 14:00,"Thanks to Vaccine Mandates::: Segregation Is Making a Comeback. Once Again::: Black Americans Will Suffer Most.

With the push to get every man::: woman and child vaccinated against COVID-19::: new policies and mandates are rolling out across the country::: aiming to separate the vaccinated from the unvaccinated.

These actions squarely fit the definition of segregation. And while we watch blatant intolerance and prejudice grow against the unvaccinated::: there seems to be a denial that these new enforcements are in any way akin to the discriminatory laws of the past.
For some::: just hearing the word segregation in the context of separating the vaccinated from the unvaccinated is triggering and deemed offensive — as if the definition pertains only to the past mistreatment of Blacks.

What many people don’t realize is that these new policies and mandates::: set forth under the guise of public health::: are and will disproportionat
ely affect Black people more than any other ethnicity in this country.

Almost half the U.S. population has not received the COVID vaccine and::: according to recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention::: Black Americans have the lowest COVID vaccination rate of all ethnicities — only 28.4% of Blacks in the U.S. have received one dose of the vaccine and only 25.1% have received both doses.

That means 75% of Black Americans are being affected more than any other race when it comes to discrimination based upon vaccine status.
Blacks are once again being segregated::: this time based on their ability or their willingness to receive an experimental pharmaceutical.
With 75% of Black Americans now being kept out of restaurants::: entertainment and sports venues::: campuses — and even having to face unemployment — where do we draw the line on hypocrisy and call things out for exactly what they are?
Which in this case::: is blatant discrimination.
With these policies::: half the population are now second-class citizens::: and Black Americans are forced to repeat history.","So should those who have been exposed to the virus and now have natural immunity (which is always preferred to ""synthetic immunity"")::: still be recommended to get an injection. (Careful::: your answer will either gain or lose credibility with educated individuals.)","https://

21-8","Probably wasn’t the best idea to leave quite so fast that you leave an Arsenal like that behind to be claimed.

Unless of course you’re planning to use it to sell other hardware to folks bc they now need it to defend themselves. Then you could just view it as trading other people’s lives for money.",Questions?,Biden is a tough guy. We’re good🤣🤣🤣🤣,Terrible current administration geriatric old man should be living in a retirement home not running a country.,Heres the problem. Wether we take the troops out now or in another 20 years::: the taliban will ALWAYS move back in and take back over. This just proves Afghanistan CANT take care of themselves. The united States has spent trillions of dollars Training them and Giving them weapons. When does it end? The troops have to come home eventually. We cant be there forever. We might as.well just call Afghanistan United States #2. Think about it,Javed Ali must have voted for Trump. He sounds like he wants American soldiers to fight in a war::: that has nothing to do with American people. How long should troops have stayed? 2040?,What political gains? When did the fighting and killing ever stop? Not to mention::: the plan to pull the US started under the orange traitor’s regime and the GOP all thought it was a GREAT idea! Just how long did you want us to go on fighting an endless war? The Afghan people were given the tools to fight for THEIR country. Why aren’t they doing that!? Did you truly want this to be an endless war?,The biggest worry is the MANY Christians in the countries underground churches. They will::: most certainly::: face death. The Taliban is a brutal terrorist group::: who only promote radical Islam.,"THOUGHTS ON AFGHANISTAN by Unbiased America

Debates about whether former President Bush should have invaded Afghanistan to begin with are legitimate.

Debates about how Bush chose to wage that war::: leaving former President Obama a deteriorating situation while Bush got distracted by Iraq are legitimate.

Debates about how Obama chose to commit to fighting::: leaving former President Trump to inherit a perpetual stalemate are legitimate.

Debates about whether or not Trump should have engaged the Taliban in peace talks at all::: leaving President Biden to inherit the complications of that deal are legitimate.

But only one president owns what is currently unfolding in Afghanistan::: and it’s the one bunkered down in Camp David right now.

He plotted his own course::: he chose the timetable::: he green lighted the strategy. He has been woefully wrong every step of the way and now has created one of the most disastrous foreign policy situations in American history.

There’s a lot of blame to go around for what has happened in Afghanistan over the last two decades::: but there’s only one administration to blame for what has unfolded over the last two months and especially the last two days.","This whole process was started by the Trump administration.
Biden actually slowed the process. We have been there for 20 years during which time the Afghanistan people did not work to have a stable country/
government. The US is not obligated to stay in any country forever to keep its peace. I feel very sorry for the women of that country as their male population did not work to keep them safe. The withdrawal from this country was a long time in the planning never did the US intend to stay 20 years.",This just about sums it up perfectly...,"ACTUALLY...THIS
SUMS IT UP WAY BETTER!!!!",We have a terrorist problem of our own. 20 years wasted. Enough!,Just one more nail in the coffin of this totally inept president. Will easily go down as the worst president this country has ever had.,Don't put this on Biden..just another example of a MAN cleaning up crap from a child demon,Sherry Nevins,With how quickly the army and government folded without the US::: supports how necessary US withdrawal was. The first mistake was arming the Mujahedeen in the first place.,Holy crap there are some real live military experts posting here on FB; they sound wonderfully informed and have every contingency answered for...who woulda thunk?,AS BIDEN aptly said::: if those Afghans are not willing to fight for their own country::: why should we risk American lives. We spent 20 years teaching those Afghans to fight and they ran away from the Taliban as soon as we stopped fighting.,U of M and the far left::: I believe you are losing a bit of your liberal millennial and gen Z supporters. They are starting to see the TRUTH::: after this fiasco::: the vaccine fiasco::: INFLATION::: THE BORDER....and HAVING THEM COME BACK TO SCHOOL IN MASKS. DO NOT FORCE A THIRD SHOT ON THEM! THE VACCINE COMPANIES STAND TO MAKE 40-46 billion. -source WSJ,Javed::: turn on the truthful news and your questions will be answered.,"I want to use this opportunity to thank Dr OLUSEGUN for what he has done for me and for helping me to get my ex back with his love spell at first I thought it's not going to work until I have faith in it and it tells me that it's guarantee and truly I have seen it thanks again papa I we advice you people who need love spell to get their ex back or any type of problems contract Dr OLUSEGUN

304?s=21",Steve Mitchell,It’s almost like we shouldn’t have been there in the first place 🤔🤣🤣,Thank you Biden you idiot!,Those poor people. Unfortunately the Mid East will always be a hell hole. Religion is dumb.,They are already coming up through the southern border. We will face a terror attack at some point I the near future.,The silver lining in all of this is that in 20 years Taliban will be bankrupt and an organically grown movement to replace it will be on its heals. The Iran regime is in its last days::: because the young have turned their back on the Iranian revolution.,5000 prisoners freed and wide open southern borders. Buckle up,Elect stupid leaders and you get horrible decisions::: js,Ali is a former Trump administration official who is deflecting blame from his boss who negotiated this withdrawal.,Guess who's fault that is OBiden,Yeah ::: no . There’s nothing to win in Afghanistan and there never was . There isn’t a good way to leave ::: it’s a waste of our troops and money . You can’t make people fight that simply don’t want to .,I feel bad for those troops sacrifice their lives over the war in the last 20 years.,So have these “experts” served in Afghanistan? Have they ever seen what it looks like on the ground? Or maybe from a comfy chair in an Ann Arbor office gives you more clarity than those who have been there..asking for a friend.,Biden didn't end it::: Trump did. And he patted himself on the back for it.,Get the facts straight first. Trump was the one that negotiated the exit and even bragged about it a few months ago. Biden dragged his feet as long as he could since he was supposed to execute it in May!,just like they did before; the US should learn::: acceptance is the the key,How could Ali fail to mention that this withdrawal was negotiated by the Trump Administration of which he was a member...? No sense of accountability with these people,"Joe can barely read the statement blaming Trump off the teleprompter
When will it finally be acknowledged he can’t put two sentences together::: let alone run the country??",We were just there for the oil::: lithium ion::: and opium,The mistake occurred in 2003 when we didn't leave,Make no mistake: your sons::: your daughters::: your husbands::: wives::: fathers and mothers around the world are at a far more significant risk of a terrorist attack today than they were 24 hours ago. You can thank Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. for that.,“Gone are the good policies that drove the Trump economy and made the world a safer place. In their place are policies antithetical to prosperity::: freedom and security.”,University of Michigan can you get us his thoughts on the deal Trump brokered with the Taliban to begin with?,"Good job Biden
🤦🏻‍♂️","We were going to leave eventually...20
years there and it only took the Taliban a week to retake the country...how long should we be willing to occupy another's country? Having lived through Vietnam era and now this...enough is enough!","Isaiah 36:6
We are the proverbial “thin Reed.”",Taliban ran it 50 years prior to us stepping in. We tried to create a society that wasn’t supported by the Afghan people. We trained 300k soldiers just for them to flee at the site of 70k Taliban. You cannot force democracy.,They Afghan men won't fight for their own freedom::: so why should our men die for them?,"I strongly disagree and I’m a HEAVY trump supporter.

At some point we have to move on from this war and the afghanis have to start protecting themselves.

How long can this war continue? 10 years 50 years 100 years 500 years… when does it stop.. they have to protect themselves… we’re flipping the bill for their war with their own people",The mistake was made 20 years ago. Perhaps the withdrawal could have been handled better but this conclusion was inevitable.,Say what you want about Trump but he would’ve NEVER withdrawn the troops out of Afghanistan,All this sh*t and all the military and civilians who died for what ? For a travel 20 years back in the past to middle-age::: because it will be middle-age in Afghanistan::: again. That's what always happen when you let a religion take the driver's seat...,"If you already have a solution in mind...sometime
s you have to create a problem so you can utilize it. Just something I read in ""How to become a globalist"" Weekly.",Great job sleepy Joe. 0 leadership,Trumpers are beside themselves with glee::: on this post & all over social media. All they see is opportunity to find fault with Biden. No actual concern for Afghans or America’s national interests (which their guy sold out to Russia::: KSA::: & others). Nobody’s fooled by the faux outrage & concern (by those who even bother trying to hide their utter delight).,Most of us wanted to get out but not cold turkey abandoning those in Afghanistan who supported efforts to treat women and girls equally and other western values. Now they face the worst of Sharia Law.,Why was up to the U.S. to keep the Taliban out of Afghanistan? How does the Arab world not have a stake in this? How does the Middle East gain from such extremism::: violence and corruption? The return of Taliban rule isn’t just a U.S. failure::: it’s a global failure.,But President Biden is such a great President! Pfft he is horrible! I had an Interpreter when I was over there in our unit. His exact words were if you ever leave they will come back worse! Man was he right!,Can’t force them to change their government::: that has to come from within. If they want it they can fight for it. Sorry so many service people had to die for a cause doomed to fail thanks to the politicians that only serve themselves.,Yeah I don’t think UM should endorse this statement because most experts believe the mistake happened 20-30 years ago. Michigan has no reason to put out an inflammatory statement like this.,"Greed set the conditions that frame this ""failure"". Let's remember the original objective - to eliminate the Al Queda threat in Afghanistan::: which was achieved shortly after Tora Bora. Adding on requirements for ""Westernizing"" an agrarian society that embraced Sharia Law made this outcome inevitable. We started macro wars with elements who supported the Taliban ouster by enforcing western policies and sensibilities - See Haqqani. You can argue that a strong central government would theoretically prevent Afghanistan from becoming a terrorist safe haven again::: but never in its history has a centrally-gover
ned Afghanistan controlled the land or the people within its borders. The country is ruled valley by valley with regional strongmen. What we did instead guaranteed a protracted presence that enriched the Military Defense Industry::: whose benefactors donated millions to political campaigns. We witnessed legalized money laundering for 20 years across all administrations
. I find it hard to believe our intelligence mechanism didn't foresee a quick transition back to Taliban control::: when in fact we saw prominent Afghan leaders shuttling suitcases full of money out of the airport and to destinations like Qatar.",You are a dreamer. Never going to happen.,Lazaro,"You are a higher education establishment sounding like a political soundboard and completely out of your depth.

The current leadership at UM is as bad as our Federal Lack of Leadership. Know your role. Teach our kids HOW to think. Stay in your lane.",Such a disaster.,Leslie Colbert Baker,There’s the problem,Samario Martin,Why is this on a Michigan thread,Trump started this disaster last year with yet another of his moronic foot in the mouth statements without consulting the military.,Mark Wiitanen,Mark Wiitanen,Mark Wiitanen,You get what you vote for,"On those last three questions: of course::: of course and no.
Those answers are as predictable as the fall we are witnessing.","I'm particularly curious why they decided to post just this particular opinion. If you read the article::: every other journalist and professor blames Trump and Biden equally! If you're going to blame one::: you can't leave out the others involvement. For that matter::: it's hard to not place blame on the Bush and Obama administration'
s as well. The Trump administration initiated the pullout and the Biden administration went along with it. That's the bottom line. We can play the Trump started it::: or it happened on Bidens watch game all day long. It still doesn't change the facts!",The Taliban is going door to door looking for Afghans who worked with the American military. It’s horrific.,why doesnt the media hate biden like they did to our previous president ??,I thought we were about putting America first and let the other country fend for themselves.,"Should read the whole article before commenting. I don't know why UM only highlighted one expert's opinion. Here's another from the article:

Ronald Stockton::: professor of political science at UM-Dearborn::: has conducted research on Arab American and Middle East issues since the 1970s.

“This day was inevitable as soon as the Trump administration signed the Doha document agreeing to withdraw all U.S. forces if the Taliban would promise to behave themselves:::” he said. “At that point::: our allies within the country knew that it was only a matter of time. Those hyperventilatin
g members of Congress are allowed to hyperventilate against Biden if they also hyperventilated
against Trump. Otherwise::: it is just shameless partisan treachery.”","Wasn't it the Trump administration that decided to end combat missions and had an agreement with the Taliban to do that by March 2021? The Biden mission honored that commitment. We had 20 years and four administrations
to prepare for this. I think we can fault all of them for bad foreign policy on this one.",Bush/Trump lackey Javed Ali with a hit piece.,"The fiasco and unfolding tragedy in Afghanistan is completely owned by Biden.

Biden should either resign or be removed from office immediately. The same applies to Secretaries Blinken and Austin. General Milley should resign or be forcibly removed.

Between the border crisis/
invasion; the economy/
inflation disaster; the mishandling of COVID; and now Afghanistan-\-\Bi
den and his administration have completely failed.",You know a liberal president really screwed up bad when they're being openly criticized on social media by public universities.,David Newton,Trump was wrong::: Biden even more so. We need another Ronnie to pull us form this great national morass.,"The Taliban will always be there ::: whether we pull out now ::: in 5 ::: 10 ::: 15 yrs .
Pull-out now TRILLIONS of dollars wasted ::: tragic loss of American and Afghanistan lives .
20 yrs is more than enough any longer will still have the same result FAILURE.",Really... this are the questions? The answer to your stupid questions are HELL NO the Taliban isn't going to keep the good things that the Afghanistan people have implemented.,Josh Larson,Jennifer Lee,Jennifer Lee,Uh::: Trump started the withdrawal of troops from Afganistan (in an effort to completely withdraw).,I won't hold my breath.....I think I have an ingling of what they will do as they've shown by their ruthless (and cowardly) beheadings::: sexism::: and intolerance!,"It’s the Taliban. Who in their right mind thinks that they will ‘act as a responsible government that seeks to improve the lives of all Afghan citizens.’? That’s crazy talk!
Here’s a link to a GoFundMe that will help my friend Srosh and his family . Don’t talk about it; Be about it.

0832784d",We know what precipitated this! An absolutely horrible president BIDEN! HE HAS BLOOD ON HIS HANDS!,This will cost Biden the presidency along with probable impeachment for this and for the border neglect disaster. Not to mention a total emasculation of our armed forces!,Just admit Biden helped create this. President Trump wouldn’t have let this happen. They seized the opportunity that Biden gave them. It’s all on him and his administration.,Will the decision to pull out of Afghanistan be seen as a critical mistake::: or rather the 20-year venture that preceded the withdrawal? My bet is on the latter. There was no happy ending in the cards here.,#MostPopularEver,It wasnt a mistake it was a failure on the previous admins to start the war to even begin and never end it. 20 years of money and lives lost for nothing,Biden trying to take the worst foreign policy president moniker away from Obama….,Doesn't Trump get some of the blame for signing a deal months ago to remove troops? Seems like there is blame to both the current and previous administration in either not keeping good intel on the Taliban or just throwing the hands up and moving on to other things.,See::: what Americans have done to the world!,They can’t make money without unrest… war equals money for these so called politicians,Biden voters posting their L,"Not a mistake.....wel
l planned out",The US is already bad enough right now I can't be bothered by what's going on in Afghanistan.,"Atta boy::: Joe.
How’s your vacation going?",Seems like a lot of wishful thinking in this guy's questioning of the Taliban.,Good job to the administration of #46 for this monumental occasion. What’s next?? But hey::: there are no more mean tweets to read and gas is over $3/gallon now. 81 million votes right? Sure 🤡🤡🤡,You get what you voted for,What a complete failure by the Biden administration,Remember when all of you were mad at the last president because his tweets hurt your feelings?,"https://

Lol.,46 deserves all the criticism he gets for leading this embarrassment,We should have never occupied that country in the first place.,Trump made the deal with the Taliban::: to pull out by May 2021. He also invited Taliban leaders to meet with him at Camp David. The mission ended with the death of Osama Bin Laden and the defeat of Al Quaida. Meanwhile::: the military industrial complex made billions of dollars.,I’m surprised UoM is allowing a post like this,"Only an educated fool::: not an expert would ""wonder if the taliban will reverse"" those gains.

Freedom is the right to be wrong.,Biden recently said the pullout would be organized::: safe::: and with no problems from the Taliban. Discuss.,Thank You Joe Biden. Sheesh.,"The government wasnt ""ovethrown""::: they left. The President bailed with a helicopter full of cash. The Taliban never left. They just blended back into society and waited. They had nothing to lose",Lucas Lotozynski,"Sad to see University of Michigan publishing an opinion without citing all the facts...like how Trump made a deal with the Taliban to pull out even sooner than now (and without involving the Afghani government)::: and freed members of the Taliban to do it.

Or how he had already reduced footprint of troops there.

Or how Obama had not done nearly enough there.

Or how Bush got us into the mess in the first place.","Sadly::: today I'm reminded of 3 recent quotes (all from democrats):

""The likelihood there's going to be the Taliban overrunning everything and owning the whole country is highly unlikely:::"" – Joe Biden

“I think he's (Joe Biden) been wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades.""
Robert Gates- Defense Secretary for the Obama Administration

“Don’t underestimate Joe’s ability to f***k things up”
- Barack Obama",What is the solution though::: occupying it until the end of time? The critical mistake was funding and supporting the mujahideen in the 80s.,This is no different then what the Obama administration did in Iraq.,The Biden decision? The deal was made in February 2020 🤣🤦🏾‍♂️,It's amazing how many heads Trump is still living rent free in,Thank you Biden..this administration is a disgrace and the US is now the laughing stock of the world...great job!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I was 40 years old and the same year my daughter started at the same school. I wanted to go to U of M Ann Arbor in 1968 for nursing when I graduated from high school but knew my parents couldn't afford it and I was brought up to believe you should never owe anyone anything. So that summer I worked to pay for stuff::: quilts for my dorm bed::: suitcases to go back and forth from home and a clock radio to keep on time. Those helped me at Hurley Hospital School of Nursing all 3 years I was there. My dad paid for my first year and I paid for the rest because I worked every summer and when I could for pay at the hospital::: evenings and nights::: as a nursing assistant. I had to take the equivalent to state nursing boards again just to get into the U of M nursing program after almost 30 years of practicing nursing to pass out of basic nursing and nutrition classes. I didn't learn a whole lot in the 5 yrs I went there after working all day I didn't already know except a lot of theory. So it really didn't make me a better nurse. It just made more money for the university.,Miles!!!!

3460e04774",Play ball,To everyone who is upset about the University of Michigan with everyone wearing masks awhile getting the Covid19 vaccine calm down they said are still allowing fans inside UofM football at full capacity with no masks at all awhile they promised all the season ticket holders they will not in the next couple of weeks. Awhile the doctors at Michigan how alot more information about Covid19 than the ones who are refusing to get the vaccine or the Delta Varient as well since am sure half of you are not real doctors at all.,Well done. Of course::: the spreadnecks will howl again::: but most of us are really grateful for informed expert commentary.,Stop it,It means we should never have a vaccine for a virus that continually mutates. It exacerbates the situation. And::: why do we need a vaccine that has a recovery rate of over 99%? Why are we not worrying more about getting unhealthy people the right help to become healthy? That would do more for the world than anything else.,It's coming from the people who received the jab. That's how variants develop. Science. Look it up.,"Watch this from a doctor specifically trained in immunology.

https://

_9KnhUu7Ba4",I can't believe how many people have reading comp issues.,"This is all great information and has proven two things. 1. That if hospitals are truly overrun and don't have the necessities for cases like this each one of these hospitals boards have a lot of explaining to do as to why they don't have the proper funding for their hospitals while collecting their massive paychecks. And 2.
If this is something that's here to stay and it will become a seasonal type of thing how does that change people's point of views of how long to continue getting said boosters if that was a thing..

Example is that with the flu shot there are people who haven't had the flu shot in 10 15 years maybe longer and never get the flu they're people that get the flu shot every year and get sick every year.. So it's kind of hit or miss really regardless but in the end with something like this::: how long do they push it before they take their foot off the gas?

I mean I think you'll probably have more luck being able to push a vaccine on people in the next two or three years when there's at least 5 years of full data. But again if it ends up being something that seasonal and your body is supposed to build immune system properly is it just a one to maybe three time booster and then that's it or is it okay to not yet it considering how other boosters are only effective between 18 to 48% depending on the year and the strain

All good thoughts but yeah I think hospital management especially private hospitals that are non-profit that somehow can open up eight or nine multi centers but still not have enough funding to protect their employees or be ready for something like this is probably the number one thing that needs to be fixed and changed",Why do you think they call it a medical practice when referring to physicians::: They do not have all the answers.,@frankspeech.com come see the truth I date you !!,Could you do a post about how previously infected people still need to get vaccinated? My family thinks they're immune and doesn't want to get vaxxed::: but they trust U-M.,How many people actually read the University of Michigan article by this doctor instead of spreading false information or none of you are usually real doctors?,Bo knew about that doctor,More fear!!,Stephanie Elle,Lies,Choice,My body::: my choice or I think that has always been the argument?

Is it real? I mean. Really real? Like really really real? Or more scare tactics to control the country ?,The cdc determines if it is delta or not. Sounds fishy to me. The covid is real but the vaccine is not protecting people from getting it. They just arent getting a severe case of it. Like the flu shot. You get the flu shot and you might get a mild case of the flu,Is there a way to test for the Delta varient? I wonder if I have it.,Not a lot of UM Med grads on the UM Med page::: eh?,99% recovery rate::: ain't nothing more than a highly contagious flu.,Kevin Molner Jr.,"https://

These kids are more likely to get hit by a car crossing State Street to Angel Hall than they are to get a breakthrough case if they are vaccinated (people under 20 are not that vulnerable to begin with).

CDC: “Yes::: you should be poked regardless of whether you already had COVID-19. That’s because experts do not yet know how long you are protected from getting sick again after recovering from COVID-19.”

ME: Oh::: okay::: we don’t know how long natural immunity lasts. Got it. So::: how long does poke-induced immunity last?

CDC: “There is still a lot we are learning about COVID-19 pokes and CDC is constantly reviewing evidence and updating guidance. We don’t know how long protection lasts for those who are poked.”

ME: Okay … but wait a second. I thought you said the reason I need the poke was because we don’t know how long my natural immunity lasts::: but it seems like you’re saying we ALSO don’t know how long poke immunity lasts either. So::: how exactly is the poke immunity better than my natural immunity?

CDC: …

ME: Uh … alright. But::: haven’t there been a bunch of studies suggesting that natural immunity could last for years or decades?

CDC: Yes.

NEWYORKTIMES: “Years::: maybe even decades::: according to a new study.”

ME: Ah. So natural immunity might last longer than poke immunity?

CDC: Possibly. You never know.

ME: Okay. If I get the poke::: does that mean I won’t get sick?

BRITAIN: Nope. We are just now entering a seasonal spike and about half of our infections and hospital admissions are poked people.

ME: CDC::: is this true? Are there a lot of people in the U.S. catching Covid after getting the poke?

CDC: We stopped tracking breakthrough cases. We accept voluntary reports of breakthroughs but aren’t out there looking for them.

ME: Does that mean that if someone comes in the hospital with Covid::: you don’t track them because they’ve been poked? You only track the UN-poked Covid cases?

CDC: That’s right.

ME: Oh::: okay. Hmm. Well::: if I can still get sick after I get the poke::: how is it helping me?

CDC: We never said you wouldn’t get sick. We said it would reduce your chances of serious illness or death.

ME: Oh::: sorry. Alright::: exactly how much does it reduce my chance of serious illness or death.

CDC: We don’t know “exactly.”

ME: Oh. Then what’s your best estimate for how much risk reduction there is?

CDC: We don’t know::: okay? Next question.

ME: Um::: if I’m healthy and don’t want the poke::: is there any reason I should get it?

CDC: Yes::: for the collective.

ME: How does the collective benefit from me getting poked?

CDC: Because you could spread the virus to someone else who might get sick and die.

ME: Can a poked person spread the virus to someone else?

CDC: Yes.

ME: So if I get poked::: I could still spread the virus to someone else?

CDC: Yes.

ME: But I thought you just said::: the REASON I should get poked was to prevent me spreading the virus? How does that make sense if I can still catch Covid and spread it after getting the poke?

CDC: Never mind that. The other thing is::: if you stay unpoked::: there’s a chance the virus could possibly mutate into a strain that escapes the pokes protection::: putting all poked people at risk.

ME: So the poke stops the virus from mutating?

CDC: No.

ME: So it can still mutate in poked people?

CDC: Yes.

ME: This seems confusing. If the poke doesn’t stop mutations::: and it doesn’t stop infections::: then how does me getting poked help prevent a more deadly strain from evolving to escape the poke?

CDC: You aren’t listening::: okay? The bottom line is: as long as you are unpoked::: you pose a threat to poked people.

ME: But what KIND of threat??

CDC: The threat that they could get a serious case of Covid and possibly die.

ME: My brain hurts. Didn’t you JUST say that the poke doesn’t keep people from catching Covid::: but prevents a serious case or dying? Now it seems like you’re saying poked people can still easily die from Covid even after they got the poke just by running into an unpoked person! Which is it??

CDC: That’s it::: we’re hanging up now.

ME: Wait! I just want to make sure I understand all this. So::: even if I ALREADY had Covid::: I should STILL get poked::: because we don’t know how long natural immunity lasts::: and we also don’t know how long poke immunity lasts. And I should get the poke to keep a poked person from catching Covid from me::: but even if I get the poke::: I can give it to the poked person anyways. And::: the other poked person can still easily catch a serious case of Covid from me and die. Do I have all that right?

…

ME: Um::: hello? Is anyone there?

In healthcare we give options to pts and let the pts decide what they feel is best for them; weather we agree with their decision or not.

“Our goal is to engage with the U-M community to develop the kind of culture and climate where everyone can thrive.

I find this video quite hypocritical. University of Michigan::: we must do better. The proposed segregation of students will do great harm to students and create a divide. These kids have already suffered greatly!,"Culture change? How about:
1. Recognizing individual rights/ control over my body
2. Health privacy
3. Don’t coerce our kids because of your fear.
4. Don’t ostracize our kids because our families have actually done real research and made an informed decision by weighing the risks and benefits.
5. How about a culture that ACCEPTS natural immunity::: and promotes prevention through vitamin D::: zinc::: good nutrition...
6.How about a culture who respects our God given freedoms to choose to participate in experiments::: do business with companies or industries or not to.",What exactly is the desired culture? Sounds like you plan on ruining the campus culture::: not develop it. Shouldn’t it develop organically? These students are adults; let them develop it. You::: U of M::: are supposed to be in the business of educating—not micro-managing every aspect of campus life.,"Sonya’s quote only applies to those students that are vaccinated. It’s ok with U-M to discriminate against those who have chosen not to participate in the experimental medical procedure. Sounds pretty hypocritical to me. I guess you can feel psychologically
::: physically::: and socially safe only if you are in the acceptable group. 🤪",So many alumni feel alienated from Big Blue. Not inclusion. Delusion.

Human trafficking involves the use of force::: fraud::: or coercion to obtain some type of labor or commercial sex act. It happens in every country::: including the United States. This video::: created by the University of Michigan Human Trafficking Collaborative::: shares the compelling stories of survivors. Learn more at HumanTrafficking.UMich.edu,7/3/2021 1:58,I am glad to see that the university is getting involved in making people aware of human trafficking. It is a huge issue.,"Wow::: this is an incredibly important collaborative. It brought me to tears reminding of me of a situation i encountered about three years ago…

One winter::: I spotted signs that popped up all over busy intersections in Westland::: MI that were suspicious because they had looked exactly like the types of signs I had previously learned were often used to ensnare victims of labor and/or sex trafficking.
The suspect road signs offered a non-descript job paying a lot of weekly cash::: with only a number to call with a woman’s name to ask for.

I take pictures of the signs::: drive around the Westland area to see what intersections they were at::: noted them and then called the police to file a report using the non-emergency line for the front desk so i could talk to an officer directly.

I explain to him the signs::: locations and reasoning why i believe they could indicate trafficking. And he basically laughs in response literally asking “do you expect me to call the number to check and see?” I replied with yes because I was too scared using my own number to contact potential traffickers. He then proceeds to take the rest of my information and if memory serves::: leaves me with a case number for my report.

Completely unsatisfied and disbelieving anything would come of my report::: I find the US national human trafficking hotline. I call them and immediately identify myself as not being trafficked or in a related emergency but rather needing to report signs of trafficking from a safe location. And I reach a man who is far more empathetic and validating of my suspicions who takes down all the details of my situation… before unintentionally
breaking my heart by telling me there was nothing more they could do::: or that i could do::: and that them having the case number I created was about as much power I could give them to intervene or help I was capable of offering.

I have no idea what ultimately came of my reports::: but the signs did get taken down a few days later. I wanted to do it myself but was too scared to do it alone. But it taught me a powerful lesson in what our systems are really setup to support… and where the real help actually comes from.

Today::: for the 11th year::: people::: brands::: and businesses around the world are recognizing #SocialMediaDay::: an annual opportunity to celebrate the profound influence of online communities. In anticipation of the event and acknowledgment of the enormous societal impact these platforms have made::: we spoke with University of Michigan School of Information professor Cliff Lampe regarding his thoughts on the divisiveness social media sows and how we can push these platforms to be more positive. myumi.ch/wlYzQ,6/30/2021 13:24,"Social media is quite powerful. And with it comes great knowledge like the song source! Yeah!

The Song Source: ""Down By The Water"" By PJ Harvey::: 1995::: M/V 3:10. The video is missing the last line in the album audio version. You can find the video for free online. Off of album named To Bring You My Love (her album::: not my words…I’m not sure what I’m feeling).

For confirmation play it and target video in 2 different windows and/or learn to eyeball it. Play them at the same time::: the music videos::: and roll it::: keeping it aligned in time::: if one is longer or shorter than 3:10. Yep. Here are some examples that work for eyeballing and playing at the same time:

“Andrenalize” By In This Moment (play at same time)::: “Halo” By Beyonce (try eyeballing this one)::: “Gold” By Chet Faker::: “Purge The Poison” By Marina::: “Feel Good” By Chet Faker::: “Arrasando” By Thalia::: “Crossing Field” By LiSA::: “…Ready For It?” By Taylor Swift::: “Starboy” By The Weeknd::: “Locura” By INNA::: “Ocean Blue” By Inside Creature::: “Crypt Of Ice” By Frozen Soul::: “LoveGame” By Lady Gaga::: “Blinding Lights” By The Weeknd::: “Roar” By Katy Perry::: “déjà vu” By Olivia Rodrigo::: “You Need To Calm Down” By Taylor Swift::: “Higher Power” By Coldplay::: and so on and so forth. “Chantaje” By Shakira. No::: do not go near “Bad Romance” By Lady Gaga and “Look What You Made Me Do” By Taylor Swift. It is too much for your mortal coil thing stuff. I will offer instead::: uh::: “Primadonna” By Marina And The Diamonds and::: uh::: “The Letter” By PJ Harvey::: and::: um::: “Astronaut In The Ocean” By Masked Wolf. Yeah. Okay::: fine::: but I feel like you are lying to me and going to do those two anyway. Uh. And “Disturbia” By Rihanna. I did warn you. “Air Balloon” By Lily Allen. “Sheezus” By Lily Allen. “It’s ‘Cause I Am” By Callista Clark. “Shut Up And Fish” By Maddie and Tae. “Blood In The Cut” By K.Flay. “Panda” By Desiigner. Hm. “E.T.” By Katy Perry ft. Kanye West. “Tehran Tokyo” By Sasy. “Purple Lamborghini” By Skrillex & Rick Ross. “Work B*tch” By Britney Spears. “The Real Slim Shady” By Eminem. I found that one initially hard but eventually realized it after returning to it later. “Mani Per Money” By Era Istrefi. “Lean” By Ashley All Day. “Build A B*tch” By Bella Poarch. “Free Mind” By Tash Sultana. “With Ur Love” By Cher Lloyd (2 different videos for this song). “Bulletproof” By La Roux. “The Hand That Feeds” By Nine Inch Nails. “Only” By Nine Inch Nails (think “bubbles”). (that was hard for me to realize). (the bubbles). “Deal With It” By Ashnikko. “2InYaSpine” By Trill T (Odessa::: Texas rap artist). “A Good Heart” By Elton John. “Wake Up Call” By Phil Collins (kind of hard…you really have to pay attention). “Las de la Intuicion” By Shakira. “Alien” By Die Antwoord. And::: finally::: um…”Some Girls” By Madonna. There. Easy enough. This is in no way about excluding anybody. Oh. And “Oh No” By Marina And The Diamonds. There. Okay::: fine. “Venus Fly” By Grimes feat. Janelle Monae. These are::: again::: examples that work. “She Wolf” By Shakira. Okay::: but just a few more. Really::: it’s a space hog. Uh. “Scream & Shout” By will.i.am featuring Britney Spears. “No Roots” By Alice Merton. “Stylo” By Gorillaz (hard…but basics tell the truth…and the timing). “Pumped Up Kicks” By Foster The People. “Zombies::: March!” By Gwar (actually kind of hard)::: “Everybody Does” By Brooke Candy::: “Focus” By Ariana Grande::: oh::: and Selena Gomez wants a “Boyfriend.” “Aerials” By System Of A Down. There. NO MORE. [X]. What? You have::: like::: the whole internet. Well::: you should. I don’t know about current restrictions wherever you are. Fine. “The Pretender” By Foo Fighters. “Die Another Day” By Madonna. “Killpop” By Slipknot. “Style” By Taylor Swift. “F***ing Young” By Tyler::: The Creator (specifically where he starts out on the rooftop like a TMNT and it ends in a combo video. Should be 6:30 or so in length). One more. I can feel it. Ug. “Intergalactic”
By Beastie Boys. DONE. What now? “Genie In A Bottle” By Dove Cameron/
Christina Aguilera. “Circus” By Britney Spears. “Who Owns My Heart” By Miley Cyrus. There. This is…just thing. “Froot” By Marina And The Diamonds. “The Killing Type” By Amanda Palmer. “Water” By Brad Paisley. “Blessed Up” By Wande (Remix::: feat. Lecrae::: Mike Todd). Please? Thank you.

Dominoes have been lining up for decades for an electric car revolution. More manufacturers are investing resources into creating electric vehicles & we see more charging stations throughout our towns & cities. However there are still some very big challenges to overcome regarding electric vehicles.

Bur mandating Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) products violates federal law.
Kennedy informed Holloway that COVID vaccines::: which are EUA products and therefore by definition experimental::: cannot cannot be mandated. Under federal law::: individuals have the right to accept or refuse EUA products. “Under the Nuremberg Code::: no one may be coerced to participate in a medical experiment. Consent of the individual is absolutely essential.
The college and university mandates have sparked a new wave of voices in the health freedom movement::: as many college students are speaking out against mandating an experimental vaccine for a virus that has a 99.74% survival rate.
According to the CDC’s own medical and scientific data::: in the last four months::: more than 4:::000 deaths tied to COVID-19 vaccines were reported as opposed to 1:::500 total deaths in the previous ten years for all vaccines::: the statement pointed out.
Dr. Farella said that children are at statistically zero risk for COVID-19. The data shows that the survivability rate for COVID-19 patients under the age of 20 is 99.997 percent.","I will help you to complete your assignment. Kindly reach me through email; njoromras@gmail

If we arrive Sunday will they be ready? Thanks!,I would really love to be able to see the peonies this year! But::: will the restrooms be open or will there be port-a-potties out AND kept clean? We came to the Arb once last year and there were only half the number of port-a-potties and they were NOT being cleaned at all - full of trash (because there were also no trash cans out) and so dirty they were unusable.

for the doctors that graduated at michigan university demonstrating knowledge and advances in medicine one more time to save the life of a patient this is what i can call the 1st world university ! i wish you all have a nice and blessed week ! 😃",Shut the Guinea Pig lab down now!,"Cruel animal experiments fail for tinnitus
I’m asking you to end cruel and flawed tinnitus research done on guinea pigs in the laboratory of Susan Shore at the University of Michigan and focus only on human-based studies::: which are already a significant component of the Shore research.

Despite years of studying tinnitus in animal models::: there is still no effective treatment or clear understanding of its cause. Information obtained from animal experiments is misleading and insufficient::: particularly for this complex disorder which is impossible to effectively model in animals.

Electrophysiolo
gical analyses that compared human tinnitus with that induced in animals indicate that there are different physiological processes occurring between humans and animals. Additionally::: behavioral tests in animals show that not all animals develop tinnitus when exposed to the same tinnitus-induci
ng agent. [Eggermont. Front. Aging Neurosci.::: 14 November 2016]

Human-based research is the only way to understand tinnitus. At the Bionics Institute in Melbourne::: Australia::: researchers developed a novel::: non-invasive::: non-radioactive
imaging method using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to study tinnitus. By comparing the scans of people with and without tinnitus and analyzing that data with machine learning::: scientists were not only able to detect tinnitus but could predict those with moderate vs. severe tinnitus with almost 90% accuracy. Human-based studies such as this hold the only potential to treat this disorder.

I urge NIDCD and UM to terminate the guinea pig studies::: which serve only to make animals suffer::: and devote research resources into the human studies already in progress.",What is wrong with you Universities? ::: UW Madison tormenting monkeys no cures::: John Hopkins mangling owls brains for adhd cures which are not forthcoming and deeply flawed? You are supposed to be places of responsibility this nonsense with guinea pigs tormented in tinnitus experiments is crude::: flawed and very unethical! There has never heen a better time to embrace non animal research through tech advancements::: the human brain and body is poles apart from a guinea pig so stop this nonsense and embrace change ::: modernise::: be a compassionate front runner for a better way without subjecting guinea pigs in this instance to horrific pain and suffering. It is not smart and sets a bad example for responsible research and is hindering progress for cures.,"If you don't know::: children and women are being killed in Gaza and Jerusalem and driven out from their homes by the Israeli occupation soldiers
You don't have to be Palestinian to support Palestine

Being human is enough to support Palestine 🇵🇸

You don't need to do much to reject that injustice::: it is enough to reject it with your heart and tongue

You know how many already from this vaccine for 12-17 is at least 3 due to cardiac arrest or blood clots.,Because you are testing kids now!,We don’t know. And won’t for years,Best answer she gave yet,Look at these 3 child abusers::: peddling an experimental vaccine that may alter DNA::: for children who aren't spreaders and are not at risk.,Zantac was on the shelves for 20+ years before they realized it causes cancer. No vaccine or medicine comes without potential side effects,"Why not the viable treatments::: Budesonide has been proven to be effective for ambulatory treatment and could decrease hospitalization
s by 85%.",People are saying that you are intentionally harming children.,You ppl are horrible::: my kids will NEVER get the death jab.... you know the truth::: how bout telling it!,No data,So::: we don’t know the risks but yet you want to tell everybody that the benefits outweigh the risk. What?,Kids have a strong immune system::: they don't need it!!,She lauggs,More BS from my liberal University!,What causes autism,Exactly! No autism!! 💕,What a shock::: people with no factual basis posting stuff of social media and all the actual sheep who like to call other people sheep blindly follow it without doing 1 minute of research for themselves...,Control of America is over !!!,Hmm.

Lol these people who are against it sound foolish.,Any information yet on children who had MIS-C already::: and how the vaccine may impact them?,Go Brady Go..,My 14 year old son received his vaccine today. He wanted to be part of the solution,Nope...,Why do children need the vaccine when they are not super spreaders and they have a survivability rate of %99.97 for covid.,No thanks::: my kids won't be test subjects,Should we give these experimental shots to newborns? Asking for a friend,Isn’t polyethylene glycol radiator coolant,The vaccine kills the immune system... tell the truth.,Experimenting on children is child abuse::: BTW..,I hope schools require it so that more people will start homeschooling their children.....,Dead air!!🤣🤣🤣,To build your immune system start with the plague::: then move onto smallpox::: piece by piece you'll get there,More dead air.

Right-wing settlers launch a fierce attack in Lod::: Haifa::: Acre::: Ramle::: and other cities:::
There are also many confrontations throughout the occupied territories 48::: and Sheikh Jarrah and Al-Eizariya in Jerusalem.

Torched Land Policy in Gaza

Israeli occupation artillery and war jets are combing north Gaza by using extensive fire against the area in preparation for land invasion into the northern part of the Gaza Strip. Paramedics and fire-brigades can't arrive at the area to provide aid to the victims of children::: women and whole families.

The Israeli occupation began to use phosphorous weapons::: targeting defenseless civilians in Gaza City::: wich is banned weapon according to the Geneva Convention (Article Three) and this is considered an international occupation that violates human rights

Your voice matters to stop the massacre

Israeli F 16 war-planes indiscriminatel
y bombard Gaza continuously::: causing big damage to buildings and neighborhoods::: demolishing roofs over the heads of many Palestinian families. Eyewitnesses say that Gaza has never witnessed worse than such bombardment tonight. Israeli war planes non-stop bombing of Gaza resulted in decimation of full families. More than 90 Palestinians are killed until now and searching for other bodies of Palestinian families stopped due to Israeli bombardment and shelling.

A new generation of nontraditional math scholars is being inspired by the Marjorie Lee Browne Scholars Program at U-M to consider earning a PhD. The two-year program::: which admits four fully funded students per year::: is funded by a National Science Foundation Bridging Bridges grant::: a program that highlights mentoring and community building to enhance diversity in STEM fields.

To help better understand herd immunity and #COVID19 vaccine hesitancy::: Abraham Wagner::: research assistant professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigan School of Public Health::: sits down to discuss these topics and provide answers to frequently asked questions. myumi.ch/1pOdV,5/6/2021 21:09,Why don't you talk about the 3:::700 that died after receiving the vaccine? From 1997 thru 2013 less people died from all vaccines combined so why isn't this being discussed?,Vaccine = Poison,"Here’s something that should scare anyone taking the jab. The Salk Institute states that Sars-Co2 is a vascular disease and the spike protein plays a key role. Further::: they state “damage occurs when cells are exposed to the spike protein on its own”. This is exactly what the “vaccine” is instructing the body to produce–the spike protein. So your own body is being instructed to make the very protein that will create vascular destruction.

Don't believe me? Look up The Great Reset and actually research it::: it has been verified by multiple sources as not a conspiracy and there are MULTIPLE World Leaders on video discussing it openly::: you can also see their agenda on The World Economic Forum.

Also look at the CDC website almost NO DEATHS FROM COMMON ILLNESSES SUCH AS COLD::: FLU::: ETC. SINCE COVID-19 started! That stuff doesn't just go away the numbers are being artificially inflated by being lumped into COVID deaths to continue fear mongering!!!

The story of the Class of 2021 is an adventure like no other. As we await tomorrow's spring commencement::: we celebrate the memories they made and the legacy they’ll leave. Forever::: Go Blue! myumi.ch/MEj1N,5/1/2021 0:58,"Open-Letter to Joe Biden of USA.

Sir.
We will first commend you::: on your emergence as current President of United States of America. You are now more or less number one world leader. Your influence and authority extends to other nations; far beyond United States.

We therefore urge you to rule with the fear of Almighty God::: who has allowed you to occupy that exulted position for a while. For the whole world is His::: and the fullness thereof. For God looks down in the kingdoms of men; to pay everyone according to his deeds.

We are glad you spoke of being of the Catholic Christian Faith. It’s a welcome development. You are expected to study the bible and go to Church regularly. The founding fathers of America like George Washington and Abraham Lincolm::: trusted in Jehovah; and He saw them through.

In the books of Kings in the bible (1st and 2nd Kings)::: the LORD visited the kings of Israel and Judah::: at one time or the other. He blessed or dealt with them and their families individually; depending on whether they served God or not. Kings like David::: Josiah and Hezekiah::: served the true God::: and they were blessed. On the other hand::: evil kings like Jeroboam and Ahab arose. Years later::: God wiped them and their families::: out of the surface of the earth!

We urge you to emulate the God-fearing disposition of your immediate predecessor::: Donald Trump. He made remarkable achievements in pushing the Middle East peace process forward. Also::: he gave recognition to Jerusalem as eternal capital of Israel. He moved US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem; and encouraged many nations to follow suit. He fought terrorism and dictatorship around the world.

We would want you to beam your searchlight::: on the activities of dictators over the nations; especially in Nigeria. The Crux of the matter is that Nigeria has been ruled for years now::: by a succession of foreign impostors. These foreign nationals are being hired::: cloned::: and masked::: to impersonate the dead Nigerian ruler. We will be very glad if you collaborate with United Nations::: or International Community::: to carry out thorough investigations of what is happening in Nigeria::: and bring perpetrators to book::: without any sentiment attached. ICC is a toothless bulldog. Wanton destruction of lives and property::: tribalism::: and high level looting of the treasury::: are all hinged on the facts::: that nobody can be held responsible. Nigeria is in virtual state of anarchy::: where Fulanis are being used to kill people on daily basis; while our wicked rulers keep quiet.

When a hireling::: is lording over a sovereign nation in the name of governance::: it has far reaching consequences on the masses. Take for instance::: the killings going on across Nigeria by sponsored Fulanis. The person at the helm of affairs::: occupying Aso Rock doesn’t care. He knows that one day::: he will suddenly leave the place with or without a trace. His kinsmen from mostly Niger Republic::: are pouring into Nigeria to engage in terrorism::: armed robbery (sorry banditry)::: kidnapping::: and other heinous crimes::: with impunity. How long will international community continue in the conspiracy of silence? We appeal to the conscience of world leaders. We are entitled to self-defence::: as our dynamic Biafra leader::: Nnamdi Kanu and his colleagues::: are organizing Eastern Security Network (ESN).

We appeal you use your position as world leader::: coupled with your sound educational background::: to stop the wickedness going on in Nigeria::: for the sake of humanity. Everybody knows that President Joe Biden is alive and real. Your picture anywhere under different attires::: remain the same. Your identity can never be under suspicion. Your oval face is there; which looks like the shape of “paw paw” in Africa.

International Community has been dragging its foot to restore Biafra. Biafra has met all the requirements::: to be an independent nation from oppressive Nigeria. If former Soviet Union::: Yugoslava::: and other countries::: can be divided into many nations without a war; why won’t Biafra go? What you people see as ethnic groups in Nigeria::: are nations in Europe. United Nations have consulted with the Biafra leader Nnamdi Kanu::: and his colleagues a number of times to deliberate on Biafra issues. We want something concrete to come out of it. Let the UN facilitate the independence of Biafra. Fulani atrocities and lordship over our people::: are far worse than colonial rule. We want to be free from the clutches of the wicked.

The issue is that Nigerian Authorities have been spending fortunes to “settle” rulers of nations that matter; to scuttle Biafra bid. Nigeria is hell to our people. Agents of Satan are ruling over the country. This struggle started over fifty years ago; when millions of our people were massacred::: raped::: their property destroyed::: and bank accounts frozen::: by evil rulers in the country. No human being or devil can stop Biafra. Anybody talking about making Nigeria to remain one::: is a hypocrite who has vested interest in wickedness going on there::: in name of governance.

Donald Trump did the much he could::: to advance the cause of Biafra during his tenure. He tried as a human being. Other world rulers like: Putin of Russia::: Netanyahu of Israel::: and Emmanuel Macron of France::: are lending their support for the restoration of Biafra. However::: our greatest trust lies in Almighty God::: creator of the whole universe. He has the power to remove anybody from whatever position and replace him with whoever pleases Him.

We urge you to hold consultations with Biafran leader::: Nnamdi Kanu and his colleagues::: to find lasting solution to Biafra restoration.

God Almighty reigns in the kingdom of men. If you observe carefully::: you will notice He is dealing with wicked rulers::: and their surrogates in Nigeria. He has taken away many of them out of this world::: since the middle of the year 2020. People are running away from Aso Rock for fear of mysterious deaths. God Almighty will judge any nation or individual::: that gangs up against Biafran people; no matter how highly placed. On the other hand::: He will bless nations and individuals::: who support and work toward Biafra independence::: from Nigerian slavery.

We are eagerly waiting for your swift positive response. Let not United Nations wait for the situation to degenerate into another genocide::: and full scale civil war before intervening. For our Biafran leader and his team are highly determined to defend our land. Let them not think they can repeat the atrocities they committed during the civil war; when millions of our people mostly civilians were massacred. They should know that if they start another war::: it will reach all parts of the country.

God said::: “Fret not yourself because of evildoers::: neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity. For they shall soon be cut down like the grass::: and wither as the green herb. For evildoers shall be cut off::: but those that wait upon the LORD::: they shall inherit the earth. For yet a little while::: and the wicked shall not be: yea::: thou shall diligently consider his place::: and it shall not be.

“The wicked plots against the just and gnashes upon him with his teeth. The LORD shall laugh at him; for he sees that his day is coming. The wicked have bent their bow::: to cast down the poor and needy::: and to slay such as be of upright conversation. Their sword shall enter into their own hearts::: and there bows shall be broken.

“I have seen the wicked in great power::: and spreading himself like a green bay tree. Yet he passed away::: and lo he was not; yea I sought him::: but he could not be found. Mark the perfect man::: and behold the upright: for the end of that man is peace. But the transgressor shall be destroyed together the end of the wicked shall be cut off”—Psalms 37.

I will write you again in due course.
Yours Sincerely:::
Evangelist Joseph U. Afurobi.

All Fossil Fuel Burning electricity generation systems::: Nuclear Power generating facilities::: Windmills::: and Solar farms are elaborate and have risks and limitations.","Open-Letter to Joe Biden of USA.

Sir.
We will first commend you::: on your emergence as current President of United States of America. You are now more or less number one world leader. Your influence and authority extends to other nations; far beyond United States.

We therefore urge you to rule with the fear of Almighty God::: who has allowed you to occupy that exulted position for a while. For the whole world is His::: and the fullness thereof. For God looks down in the kingdoms of men; to pay everyone according to his deeds.

We are glad you spoke of being of the Catholic Christian Faith. It’s a welcome development. You are expected to study the bible and go to Church regularly. The founding fathers of America like George Washington and Abraham Lincolm::: trusted in Jehovah; and He saw them through.

In the books of Kings in the bible (1st and 2nd Kings)::: the LORD visited the kings of Israel and Judah::: at one time or the other. He blessed or dealt with them and their families individually; depending on whether they served God or not. Kings like David::: Josiah and Hezekiah::: served the true God::: and they were blessed. On the other hand::: evil kings like Jeroboam and Ahab arose. Years later::: God wiped them and their families::: out of the surface of the earth!

We urge you to emulate the God-fearing disposition of your immediate predecessor::: Donald Trump. He made remarkable achievements in pushing the Middle East peace process forward. Also::: he gave recognition to Jerusalem as eternal capital of Israel. He moved US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem; and encouraged many nations to follow suit. He fought terrorism and dictatorship around the world.

We would want you to beam your searchlight::: on the activities of dictators over the nations; especially in Nigeria. The Crux of the matter is that Nigeria has been ruled for years now::: by a succession of foreign impostors. These foreign nationals are being hired::: cloned::: and masked::: to impersonate the dead Nigerian ruler. We will be very glad if you collaborate with United Nations::: or International Community::: to carry out thorough investigations of what is happening in Nigeria::: and bring perpetrators to book::: without any sentiment attached. ICC is a toothless bulldog. Wanton destruction of lives and property::: tribalism::: and high level looting of the treasury::: are all hinged on the facts::: that nobody can be held responsible. Nigeria is in virtual state of anarchy::: where Fulanis are being used to kill people on daily basis; while our wicked rulers keep quiet.

When a hireling::: is lording over a sovereign nation in the name of governance::: it has far reaching consequences on the masses. Take for instance::: the killings going on across Nigeria by sponsored Fulanis. The person at the helm of affairs::: occupying Aso Rock doesn’t care. He knows that one day::: he will suddenly leave the place with or without a trace. His kinsmen from mostly Niger Republic::: are pouring into Nigeria to engage in terrorism::: armed robbery (sorry banditry)::: kidnapping::: and other heinous crimes::: with impunity. How long will international community continue in the conspiracy of silence? We appeal to the conscience of world leaders. We are entitled to self-defence::: as our dynamic Biafra leader::: Nnamdi Kanu and his colleagues::: are organizing Eastern Security Network (ESN).

We appeal you use your position as world leader::: coupled with your sound educational background::: to stop the wickedness going on in Nigeria::: for the sake of humanity. Everybody knows that President Joe Biden is alive and real. Your picture anywhere under different attires::: remain the same. Your identity can never be under suspicion. Your oval face is there; which looks like the shape of “paw paw” in Africa.

International Community has been dragging its foot to restore Biafra. Biafra has met all the requirements::: to be an independent nation from oppressive Nigeria. If former Soviet Union::: Yugoslava::: and other countries::: can be divided into many nations without a war; why won’t Biafra go? What you people see as ethnic groups in Nigeria::: are nations in Europe. United Nations have consulted with the Biafra leader Nnamdi Kanu::: and his colleagues a number of times to deliberate on Biafra issues. We want something concrete to come out of it. Let the UN facilitate the independence of Biafra. Fulani atrocities and lordship over our people::: are far worse than colonial rule. We want to be free from the clutches of the wicked.

The issue is that Nigerian Authorities have been spending fortunes to “settle” rulers of nations that matter; to scuttle Biafra bid. Nigeria is hell to our people. Agents of Satan are ruling over the country. This struggle started over fifty years ago; when millions of our people were massacred::: raped::: their property destroyed::: and bank accounts frozen::: by evil rulers in the country. No human being or devil can stop Biafra. Anybody talking about making Nigeria to remain one::: is a hypocrite who has vested interest in wickedness going on there::: in name of governance.

Donald Trump did the much he could::: to advance the cause of Biafra during his tenure. He tried as a human being. Other world rulers like: Putin of Russia::: Netanyahu of Israel::: and Emmanuel Macron of France::: are lending their support for the restoration of Biafra. However::: our greatest trust lies in Almighty God::: creator of the whole universe. He has the power to remove anybody from whatever position and replace him with whoever pleases Him.

We urge you to hold consultations with Biafran leader::: Nnamdi Kanu and his colleagues::: to find lasting solution to Biafra restoration.

God Almighty reigns in the kingdom of men. If you observe carefully::: you will notice He is dealing with wicked rulers::: and their surrogates in Nigeria. He has taken away many of them out of this world::: since the middle of the year 2020. People are running away from Aso Rock for fear of mysterious deaths. God Almighty will judge any nation or individual::: that gangs up against Biafran people; no matter how highly placed. On the other hand::: He will bless nations and individuals::: who support and work toward Biafra independence::: from Nigerian slavery.

We are eagerly waiting for your swift positive response. Let not United Nations wait for the situation to degenerate into another genocide::: and full scale civil war before intervening. For our Biafran leader and his team are highly determined to defend our land. Let them not think they can repeat the atrocities they committed during the civil war; when millions of our people mostly civilians were massacred. They should know that if they start another war::: it will reach all parts of the country.

God said::: “Fret not yourself because of evildoers::: neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity. For they shall soon be cut down like the grass::: and wither as the green herb. For evildoers shall be cut off::: but those that wait upon the LORD::: they shall inherit the earth. For yet a little while::: and the wicked shall not be: yea::: thou shall diligently consider his place::: and it shall not be.

“The wicked plots against the just and gnashes upon him with his teeth. The LORD shall laugh at him; for he sees that his day is coming. The wicked have bent their bow::: to cast down the poor and needy::: and to slay such as be of upright conversation. Their sword shall enter into their own hearts::: and there bows shall be broken.

“I have seen the wicked in great power::: and spreading himself like a green bay tree. Yet he passed away::: and lo he was not; yea I sought him::: but he could not be found. Mark the perfect man::: and behold the upright: for the end of that man is peace. But the transgressor shall be destroyed together the end of the wicked shall be cut off”—Psalms 37.

I will write you again in due course.
Yours Sincerely:::
Evangelist Joseph U. Afurobi.

If I get the shot many get sick and their immune system goes into hyperspace which is supposed to build herd immunity.
If the shot was going to protect you and you got the shot how does that build herd immunity? Isn’t herd immunity becoming exposed contract the virus immune system beats it and it passes along to other people?
If we isolate from one another how can herd immunity grow?
Is that why we need a vaccine because people no longer gather?
Wouldn’t it be healthier and more advantageous for people to take immune building vitamins and be around people?
That would also help the mental state of people instead of them being isolated and drained they would feed off from other peoples closeness.",It’s poison,SICK.

The ones who survive with serious debilitating injuries are not finding any help to cope with those injuries. They cannot sue Pfizer or Moderna because the EUA protects them from any liability::: and doctors are totally unprepared (and in many cases probably unwilling) to treat COVID mRNA injuries::: so the victims are on their own to try and find help::: at their own expense.

Then they look at the white man as a boogeyman!? Rich people like mark schissel and the rich politicians that run institutions need to go away. The reason a guy like Derek chauvin had the opportunity to did what he did was A. The union fighting for his job! B. The city people in charge not keeping him fired! He had been in trouble several times for abusing power! All you rich politicians talking about injustice? It comes from you all not doing your jobs! Then their media sources blame it on a white man who cares nothing about color! And says he’s racist even if he don’t know he is! Martin Luther king jr dreamed of a time when we judged men by their character and not the color of their skin! All the media and politicians want to do is make it about the color of skin!

Fair and equitable right?

Chauvin is guilty of manslaughter and police brutality. He didn't set out to kill Floyd. Floyd was going to die due to the amount of drugs in his body::: his heart condition::: and a lack of response to get the paramedics to the scene on time. (calling it what it is)

Does Chauvin deserve to go to jail? Yes. But not for murder. Matter of fact lock up Hollis for pleading the 5th. After all he set everything in motion by being Floyd's dealer.

""Johnson & Johnson criminal history""
""Astrezeneca criminal history""

That anyone has any trust at all becomes simply amazing.",But not white Americans?,Keep on looking at EVERYTHING thru the lens of black & white / race. You wanna be known as progressives::: but keep up the aggressive tribalism — you’re as regressive as can be. Sad.,It's all about race! Everyone complains about Blacks not getting the vaccine because it must be a racist conspiracy by the Whites?? If that was the case::: you wouldn't have to beg them to get it.... They have every opportunity that we all have::: but no::: they have to be begged to get it !!! UGH!!,"Sometimes::: I am genuinely embarrassed that I received multiple degrees from this institution.

Not everything is about race. An equal number of black AND white people are concerned about the vaccine (although I encourage everyone to get vaccinated).

I forgave my man and he is back to the same man i used to know and he loves me so much now and we do everything as a couple with our daughter.

ACT.,In recognition of Women's History Month::: please immediately purge your Board of Regents of Mr. Ron Weiser.,If you truly want to recognize amazing women::: then Weisner needs to go.,Great School? or Boys club? As the parent of a daughter::: in Michigan::: I can hardly support a university that supports the likes of Ron Weiser.,It is really disappointing that this panel does not have nursing represented. But not surprising.,In recognition of women’s history month you should boot recent GOP politicians that threatened female leaders from having anything named after them and even accepting their money. So much for women in history.,Will Ron Weiser overseeing this program?,Maybe we alums should stop donating as long as Weiser remains a regent.,this seems hypocritical considering Ron Weiser is on your board of regents,What woman would want to attend UM after Weiser’s despicable comments? My three daughters graduated from Michigan as did both their parents::: and I am appalled that Michigan has allowed this horrible man to represent this college. Shame on Michigan.,"As a Michigan Alumnus::: LSA::: BS::: Computer Science 1986::: I am disgusted beyond belief re: the misogynistic and violent statements made by UM Board of Regents member::: Ron Wieser. He needs to be removed immediately otherwise UM is complicit and he will forever be a stain on UM. Show that you are truly Leaders and Best by standing up for women and against violent rhetoric by your actions. Otherwise::: your recognition of #WomensHistoryMo
nth rings hollow.

In a bit of irony::: I just received a phone call from a grad student asking for donations for the Rackham Graduate Student Emergency Funds. I almost said no because of Ron Weiser::: but I decided to donate because I didn't want the grad students to suffer for his actions. But::: I will be following this issue closely and if Weiser is not forced to resign::: I will have made my last donation to any University of Michigan fundraising request.",#FireRonWeiser or remove::: whichever. Completely reprehensible comments.,I’m incredibly disappointed in this school. After the waves of abuse cover-ups against women on major college campuses::: Weisner::: and others like him::: have no place on your board. Let him “learn to do better” on his own time and put someone else in that doesn’t have a misogynistic view of women!,"Why has Mr. Weiser's email address been removed from the website? The profile of every other regent on this website includes a contact email address. https://

ron-weiser/.","Here’s a worthy conversation? Please get rid of Ron Weiser who advocated for the three witches being burned at the stake. He claims his statement was taken out of context. The direct quote: our job now is to soften up those three witches and have good candidates against them::: be ready for the burning at the stake. Oh he also advocated assassinating those who voted in support of Trump’s impeachment. Email umregents@umich
.edu","Let’s have a critical
Convo about Ron Weiser. As a graduate and a daughter starting at UofM in the fall I am disgusted he isn’t forced off the board. There is no place for the language against women let alone anyone. There is no place for talk of killing especially
Knowing the threats and people who attempted to kidnap the governor. Party aside it’s not ok. Weiser needs to go. Don’t plan on getting another dime of my money if you are ok with. Silence and inaction is complacency. .",I think U of M will sit on this for awhile and hope it blows over. mr. weiser is a big donor after all::: and that most likely trumps principles. How fitting would it be to bounce mr. weiser from the Board of Regents during Women's History Month.,It's amusing to watch Ron Weiser::: who seems to be feeling a daily need to chest-pound and stave off impotence::: dig himself in a deeper hole. Oh::: his open call for assassination was not meant to be a call for violence? Maybe before he remains involved with UM::: he needs to retake freshman English::: or maybe he needs to go back to 6th grade. Because assassinations are violent::: and he probably should have known that. Also::: if he watches the news even once a month::: he would be inclined to see that there are all kinds of violent doofs armed up and hoping for some perceived permission.,Lisa Kelly Reed,"I just posted a comment about mr. weiser and U of M. at the top of this page and I don't see it anymore. Does U of M censor comments on its public page? I mentioned not hearing/seeing any comments from U of M regarding weiser::: but I just found one. I believe President Schissel and a dean ""lambasted"" weiser. Whew! I'm so glad that happened! That's undo the damage weiser has done. That'll show him! When are you going to relieve mr. weiser of his duties as a Regent? Or do you condone what he said because that's what it surely looks like.",Ron Weiser should be made to resign.,Need financial help with school stuffs and personal stuffs?

He said that his words were taken out of context::: but that means only that he was sorry he got caught.

How will the University address this? Or is it open season on any woman who dares to achieve and excel?

What a racist virus 🙄,Gtfoh,Good old liberal U of M!,Who’s been running those cities for years?.....,In other words::: lack of proper nutrition to defend themselves from a virus?,How about differences in biology::: differences in culture? It has nothing to do with race which is just plain stupid.,You think? Help the people!,Dustin Hubbard,Allen Bell,Didnt know money was a preventative to a virus.,Wow::: that's a stretch.,Where in the USA is there active segregation? WTF?,& away we go!,This why the football team is trash?,Scott Mann,"How are you not viewing all the factors in this? This is so dishonest..... just a few factors come to mind........

1. Vitamin D definciey rates::: in people of color? Nothing to do with anything other than their biology? Pretty simple Lighter skin absorbs more vitamin D from sun::: darker skin does not::: as a natural evolution based on where a persons ancestors lived geographically.


2. Socio economics- is it possible people of lower income levels live with more people to reduce costs? Hince making the likelyhood of passing Covid around more likely? Not a race issue.

3. Population Density of Metro areas- Possible that living on top of eachother in a densely populatied area creates a scenerio where its easy to pass around?",Ok::: Karen.,it sounds so mod ! the truth is people on welfare and who work in the gig economies were hit hard! this meant lots of poor white single moms and their kids. stop race baiting,Wow. Propaganda much? 🙄,Whoever wasted their tuition with this study needs a refund! Your educational credentials are now ranked with your football team for posting this garbage. Good job! Segregation is and has been long gone. People really need to stop this rhetoric! It’s posts like this that keep the divisiveness alive and well. Can we just become 1 country? Please? 🙏,It’s nice to see people calling out the blatant lies they are spreading,William Bailey Swift,Or perhaps because their bigger cities??? Hello!!!,Biased statements. The truth is unhealthy::: uneducated::: low income people generally don't follow rules and guidelines because they feel they don't want to be told what to do!,From the Florida Lawbooks::: Misuse Of Police Officiating.,these comments show a lack of frontal lobe development 💀💀,🙁,My personal study says that Covid -19 would not have bee a threat if the Chinese lab had not invented it and been careless to let it out of the lab.,I already knew what to expect when coming to the comments section::: but it is still astonishing to see this much blatant disregard for the scientific method from a study coming out of a department ranked #3 in the entire country. I know that very little will change the minds of those who refuse to believe in science and research... but whew chile 😩,"Dear U-M::: we crossed your school of our list of possible schools for our child to attend. I'm sure you don't need our money. Keep up the great work of silencing those with differing opinions...show
s what a truly backward and non-inclusive system you are running.",I'm not a scientist (and apparently neither are they)::: but maybe::: just maybe it had more to do with these areas are more densely inhabited.,Then it seems there should have been a lot of homeless effected . But I’ve never seen one story that they have been .,Ooh::: here comes all the armchair sociologists that think they know more. Grab the popcorn,The CDC count shows “white women” as the most affected group followed by white men. I find it disturbing how people take advantage of a crisis for their own politics goals.,“ never let a crisis go to waste “ sound familiar?,Yeah OK,So then why did I get it?,I doubt that's true.

So sad...,Segregation??? Where???,No. Just::: no.,More talk of segregation by the people who want segregation... Flip flop::: back and forth... You think they'd be dizzy by now...,As far as I know in todays world if you have segregation then that is by choice::: not policy!,And who's fault is this ?? The white man is to blame. Unlike the people and party you vote for Over and over and over,🧐,This is the dumbest sh!t ever. Had to do with crap governors::: but yeah race always wins the polls.,You must be joking.,So all the majority Democrat ran cities? Don't need an expensive college degree to figure that one out.,Matt Steward,Lmao 🇺🇸,Rachel Brustein the laugh reacts and comments on this post are so concerning 😬,Add lower accessibility to COVID19 vaccines also due to inequalities based on race & income. Governor down here in Florida is favoring white wealthy communities over people of color in lower income areas.,And you thought just the football team sucked?,This article is absolute trash.,Oh good grief!🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️,Those of you who aren’t smart enough to decipher research such as this can freely choose to stop following my university’s posts.,You mean in all those Metro places that were rioting and looting for months without wearing masks,Waste of money,Yes cause the virus is racist!,Everything is racist!!!! Woohoo!!!!,One comment. BS.,It's a CASUAL relationship::: not CAUSAL,Lol. What a joke.,Stfu,Stop::: just please stop... playing this card has gotten extremely old !,Was self quarantining taken into account? Was following the guidelines taken into account including no gatherings of people including families?,omfg::: now covid is racist /facepalm,"Odd!

It's killing everyone equally::: so everyone needs equal care!"" but when it's research about how to prevent infection it's all ""deal with it::: cucks."" I wonder what the difference is!

(Just kidding::: I don't wonder - it's the presence of people of color in the research or photography.)",GTFOH,I'm sure the social an family oriented events of those groups had nothing to do with it. Smh...,Well if this is true::: you libturds need to stop voting democrat. They are the modern day plantation owners.

Really U of M?,"Losing more and more respect for this ""school""",Ok,Have you done a study in Appalachia?,Lori Patt,I knew covid was racist so are hurricanes.. not to mention sexists!,BS...,Why because they are somehow incapable of wearing masks::: social distancing and staying home unless it is for necessity????,"This “study” seems to be filled with preconceived notions of blaming “segregation” for everything.
Is it not possible that behavior influences chances of getting Covid? Listening or not listening to CDC recommendations
? Maybe staying home and not having large family or neighborhood gatherings?
There are many possibilities other than “segregation”.
And once again::: a liberal biased study that places correlation over proof of causation.",Shut the **** up. How stupid can y'all be.

Just stop the politics it's not rocket science","No .... you have Nazi Governors That locked people down and Theree EOs that sent sick people to nursing homes and assisted living ..... she killed thousands of seniors!!! Just like New York !!!
Whitmer should be held accountable for all the people she killed with her EOs and lock downs ...! Has nothing to with race !!! Stop the bs !!

Look at Florida...! Twice the population as Michigan and the OLDEST POPULATION IN THE USA...... were open and never had the problems that Michigan had .... Over 22 million in Florida!!
Governor Ron DeSantis .... !!",Clearly a bunch of Walmart Wolverines on this post.,Lots of very smart ppl on this thread lol not,I think I’ll just follow the sports pages now::: thanks.,🙄,If you try hard enough to tie everything to race::: you will succeed. The numbers in NY would have been lower if Cuomo hadn’t forced COVId patients into nursing homes too. Don’t ignore that little gem of reality.,You’re telling me a study performed by a liberal leaning school::: conducted by liberals will give you a result of guilt and stir emotions....,And then they made more income disparities by closing everything down and making people lose their homes. Go figure.,I guess you'll have to move out some of the city's population out so the numbers will go down. What do you expect in cities with 500:::000+.?? Of course the more people::: the higher the numbers::: small cities::: towns::: villages and rural areas have less people so lower numbers::: just a bit of common sense will tell you that.!! Oh::: wait::: we're talking establishment career political hacks and their appointees::: no common sense in the lot.!!.....,Larry Horrell,Maybe just maybe it could due to life style choices,So instead of sending money to foreign countries and supporting illegal immigrants::: maybe we should take care of our own citizens who are living in segregation and poverty. Just a thought.,UM what a disgraceful post,You mean::: segregation lead to bad things again? Shocker! History is important people! Regardless if it used upon a race of people or a society of people::: it NEVER benefits anyone!,Maybe they shouldn't have put covid patients in nursing homes,So if your black and poor do you also get worse colds and flu than white rich people,Wow! FINALLY this Coronavirus is revealed to be RACIST after all... what a clever virus::: had us ALL fooled thinking that it was killing folks of ALL races.... 🙄,Now Michigan might as well re-designate their BS degree as just BS.,Did you really need a study for that?,All democratic ran states & cities... #shutdown,"Perhaps it would be a good idea to factor in and acknowledge that dark skinned people tend to have lower vitamin D levels due to the extra melanin in their skin....yes::: that's a real thing. And those that have died or are hospitalized tend to have low vitamin D levels...there is a correlation there::: but I guess the ""experts"" want to ignore that fact. Why wasn't the State supplementing poorer communities with good food and immune support? 🤔",This post makes me sick,I am sorry I don't buy this.,"Wow::: U of M! Higher education is failing us as a nation.
Way to keep the divide real and using a pandemic as a crutch!
How about it’s higher because the population is more dense in large cities and people are still getting together in high numbers without precautions.
College has officially begun to make this country more ignorant!",Is this real life?,Shutdown::: putting positive patients in nursing homes::: no school::: riots all summer::: the list goes on...,Being poor sucks. Thanks for the super important study.,"Racial segregation?

It has absolutely nothing to do with lousy progressive policies.",All cities that traditionally have Democratic Mayor's and city councils. Interesting they would have the most poverty.,Scotti Peterson the comments on this post did not pass the vibe check,Segregation??,So this is a problem but the consent killing of individuals in these cities means nothing? These Covid studies are so stupid!,Sadly I’ve known many white ::: elderly people who died from covid and thanks WHITMER,So::: basically::: you wasted time and money on a study. 🙄,Were the people in question asked if they went to a protest??,"Let’s sit back snd look at the racist comments by the uneducated right.

News",Apparently not many of the people posting here attended University of Michigan as their ignorance is showing. Perhaps it would be wise to learn something instead of spouting out garbage,Conjecture.,Matthew Graboske Jr. Dani Graboske look at them making it safe for y’all,Not likely at all!,How about a study of increasing isolation during the holidays increasing suicide?,Wow! Is this a rough estimate? 🤔😂,How can you study what (presumably) DIDN'T happen and arrive at that conclusion?,"This used to be a ""free country"" before covid",Just curious how many of you naysayers actually have a degree from UM? At all?,🤣🤣🤣🤣,Adam Bussard,I don’t know anyone that social distanced lol,We gathered and so did everyone else I know so I’d say this is flawed.,Funny thing is... their figures are way off!! Most of us carried on with the holidays like usual. You didn’t save anybody. More people died in the US in 2019 than all of 2020,Show the research,Fake news!,That’s bs::: I got symptoms the day after Thanksgiving::: I was exposed probably 10 days bf and all I did was go to work with the same 10 people who have Not had covid::: masks don’t help and neither did social distancing,The amount of idiots on this university of Michigan thread that didn’t even attend college anywhere is incredible. Surely the scientists and companies making vaccines are wrong::: but Roy the assistant manager at jiffy lube has the low down on the virus and the liberal media conspiracy to ruin malls and poison their bud heavy so it turns them gay.,Don Haskins,Lololololol,Oh please. We gathered w/family as usual::: 18 of us::: 4 states & all ages. Not even a sniffle!,Total bs,What did Whitmer pay you to say that?,Gotta love how all of this “factual data” is coming out now that Biden is President 🙄🙄🙄,Brought to you by the same people that thought Rich Rod and the spread offense was a good idea.,Yea because nobody in Toledo had it they were running south for cocktails on the weekends lol,Horse crap!!!!!,You mean when people actually said “screw it” (PG) and visited their families and traveled?,Suckers...,Marcus Loper,Haha sure it did🤣🤣🤣 Have fun killing people with that pos vaccine idiots!!!,LOL!! We did the same thing we do every year - over 15 of us gathered on multiple days - some from out of state - we even had a restaurant seat us as a group of 8. Went to friends homes as well for parties. Great study 😂😂,Wow all fake news on this page even the people!!!!!,SHAVUAH TOV,you think we were listening? Thats funny.,🤦‍♀️,Bs !!,Sure they did. 😉,University of Fearmongering!,HCQ Could have SAVED MORE LIVES along the way ... if the Left and the MEDIA did not discount it. We know.,"Look::: Guys.
We know.
We know HCQ was a valid and affordable medicine for Covid-19.
We know HCQ has been safely used for 60+ years.
We know the left and mainstream media lied to us.
We know the Lancet created a fake study on HCQ and had to retract it.
We know the AMA in JANUARY suddenly indicated HCQ is a good treatment for Covid-19 and stated it will save lives.
We know the left and the media virtually attacked Donald Trump unfairly and ridiculed him for indicating HCQ can help us.
We know MANY people died unnecessarily because of this.
We know our politicians are not being fully honest with us.
We know the elections were rigged and mainstream media was part of the coverup.
We know many of our politicians are controlled by others … and these others may be evil.
We know you don’t report the full truth.
We know Antifa and BLM were PART of the plan in the Capitol upheaval and SOME of the DC police were in on it.
We know “magically” democrat run states are suddenly opening up after January 20 as though the threat of COVID-19 diminished when the three-volley salute for Biden took place.
We know the mainstream media is owned by 6 key entities who are controlling the messages precisely as they wish. (https://

We know Mockingbird is legit and gaslighting has been ongoing as you push FEAR and LIES.
We know you use bots online to give the impression of an “army” from the left.
We know those who readily consume your crafted narratives of fiction prefer to homogenize anyone who does not go along with them::: absurdly condemning even mild moderates as crazy zealots.
We know CENSORSHIP is your latest tool to silence practically all dissonance::: even the most tame statements that go against your fake narratives are “fact checked” by first amendment killers.
We know those who have lapped up the mainstream media messages can’t possibly believe any of this is true.
Ultimately::: we know better than to ever trust you. We all know.
Know that.",What a pile of 💩,Not many ppl listed to any of that.... we all had huge gatherings.,Or as study shows it made no difference,People did Christmas and thanksgiving maybe this virus isn’t what they think shocker,Do you know how many came to Florida for both holidays ??

You oughta be ashamed of yourself u of m,But wait. I thought our irresponsible behavior over the holidays was going to kill grandma and doom us all. Gretch told us so.

It is amazing this year.,Full of crap,Doesn't take a 4 year degree to figure that 1 out,Sure::: periodic measures makes sense.

Even MSU isn't that dense,I see all the religious and trumptarded folk are out in full force.,When did my beloved alma mater decide to walk away from science? There are males and there are females.

Stop talking to us as if this nonsense is fact.,Man::: i feel like a woman...,I identify as a vagitarian.,Like what? Which hole to dress for?,I wonder why. Idiots,🥀,"University of Michigan many of the comments on here are incredibly transphobic and potentially triggering to a population you are highlighting in this very post as being vulnerable to harm. Considering the nature of these comments::: which are dehumanizing and disgusting::: I think it is your moral imperative to moderate the comment section and openly/
explicitly take a stand against bigotry with some kind of statement on this post or in the comments. Otherwise::: you might as well have not posted the article in the first place. Staying neutral is not an option here.",A lot of people commenting would never get into UofM and it shows 🤦🏻‍♂️,I'm a lifelong UofM fan but am now unfollowing this page due to the university's FAR LEFT stance on EVERYTHING!,Matthew Dale Thompson,have you watched the Jules episode of Euphoria that dropped over the weekend?,"No one would have known w/o a ""study."" 😢",It's kind of neat to see a particular demographic just melt when confronted with anything that isn't misogynist fest 2021.,These comments are not it. Wow. So much hatred.,This is why teens shouldnt be allowed to make choices like this. They cant comprehend the consequences of their actions before they make them. You need to be in a mature state to handle being transgender. Its not for the faint of heart::: you have to be brave. You cant just change and then cry at the slightest bit of resistance from others. Know that the world is bigger than you. Do what you want with your body but the whole world is never going to love you and accept you for who/what you are and that goes for gay and straight people also.

Grateful to have cut people like that out of my life already.,I'm in the small percentage of people who believe these young people are mis-wired and it's a mental health issue.

So is trans better for some people::: or worse? No idea really.,Uh::: duh. Needed a university study to tell us this.?,Tommy Jones,They hate on here is ridiculous.

Black communities have long been underserved in terms of healthcare which means chronic diseases get left under treated or not treated at all. We have been told that populations with underlying conditions are more vulnerable to Covid complications and death. This is supported by number of cases and deaths. Hence::: disproportionat
e impact.

The fact that a lot of y’all jumped to “race baiting” instead of being knowledgeable or reading up on it says more about you than this intervention initiative.

CNN BREAKING: The flu is racist 😂,And people actually pay to attend this school.....🤣,People be preaching change but not actually doing anything just sitting here whining about it,will you people stop being stupid already:::::: this virus IS NOT racist... stop spreading hatred.... maybe its a good thing your athletics are put on hold for now...it takes common sense and intelligence to partake in sports,FFS::: who are they arguing with? It's like there's some racist faction that says no vaccine for black people! Really::: people who make loony garbage like this need to hand in their degrees.,Think what you want I don’t really care if you get it or not.,"Why don't you tell the about how that are starting these required ""Human Experiments"" at a black school in NJ? Why didn't they start this BS at Harvard? Isn't it funny how the US reports the shots as ""Emergency Use"" and ""Safe & Effective"" and other counties report it as ""Human Experiments"" and ""Clinical Trials""::: looks like the Tuskeege all over again!

My daughters in college and I'm not a fan of forcing her to partake in these vaccine clinical trials. Students are our future::: they should have a choice to decline. Can we learn from Israeli's example and give them a choice?

""Reading the contract signed between the Israeli government and Pfizer::: it is clear::: unequivocal and unambiguous that this is a clinical study for all intents and purposes::: and thus::: it needed to be approved by the Helsinki Committee:::"" a senior official explained to Calcalist::: adding: ""And that's what will be written in the Committee's opinion: 'There's nothing wrong with clinical trials::: on the contrary::: but clinical trials (human trials) must get committee approval::: and of course::: from the people on whom the trial is being conducted::: while giving the right to refuse to be part of the trial.

20 Years ago I began research on the critical Socratic Dialectical Inquiry—""How did Legality and Morality get separated in America? Eventually answering this question became a 5-Volume collection of books titled-\-\""THE PROGRESSIVE REVOLUTION: History of Liberal Fascism through the Ages.""
In the Prologue section of those books I cited ""Year 1871"" as Year One when Liberal Fascism became fully operational in America and the original 1787 Constitution founded under Natural Law::: Natural Rights::: and the Original Intent of the Constitutional Framers became a deadletter. . . Until the Apotheosis of PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP (2017 - Present) who recently resurrected our sacred REPUBLIC conceived on July 4::: 1776 = United States for America🥰🥳🙏
What does that mean for U.S. in Year 2021? “Since 1871 the United States president and the United States Congress has been playing politics under a different set of rules and policies. The American people do not know that there are two Constitutions in the United States. The first penned by the leaders of the newly independent states of the United States in 1776. On July 4::: 1776::: the people claimed their independence from Britain and Democracy was born. And for 95 years the United States people were free and independent. That freedom ended in 1871 when the original “Constitution for the united states for America” was changed to the “THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA”.

Worry about getting the football program strong again not this other bs,Chris Parent,"The whataboutism in this comment section is as hilarious as it is to be expected by the Trump cult followers. I'm not going to appeal to any sense of reason because it is clear you have lost the congnitive ability to discern fact from fiction. You've lost the presidency and the senate over this lunacy::: enjoy the next two years ""patriots.""",It was no Portland!,Worry about beating that team from the south. You are not a political institution.,I see all the stable geniuses have their internet turned on tonight.,U of M poster::: you prove you are a fascist::: and by including U of M in your fascist post::: you implicate U of M as an institution of fascism... Step aside and sit down... Universities are supposed to be bastions of free speech and conversation::: not fascist safe spaces for cowering leftists with thin skin...,Who allowed them on the grounds ? Homeless was removed for trying to sleep on many state Capitol grounds . They could stop this. I cry out God heals our lands not no man.,Mind your own business!,There's still parts of Seattle occupied by antifa.,Keep your BS to yourself,I have a lot of respect for the UofM but your statement set me back. There was no violence today and please quit and the assault on our liberty was by stealing the election. Today Americans stood up for our rights as a free people. We will not let lifetime politicians tell us how to live! Politicians are getting richer by the minute. I condemn you Mark for making such a statement on behalf of such a fine establishment as the UofM. You should be fired,Robert Hudson,Wow::: that REALLY helped (in no way whatsoever).,Mike Here,Mike Here,They say the violent protesters were Trump supporters but I don't know.,Actually the assault on democracy was the massive voter fraud...,Lol all these whiny treasonous crybabies forgot how Democracy works::: you lost and this little tantrum isn't going to change anything. Stay mad morons,and the disrespect for the last four years. SHUT UP.,Go figure a liberal University who's hypocrisy knows no limits!!! Also you should remove the BLM patch from your basketball uniforms. Michigan Athletics should not be supporting a liberal extremists group responsible for the destruction of Minneapolis and other cities in the name of peaceful protest.,"Well stated. United we stand!!
Go Blue!!",Go Blue 💙💙💙,OHIO!!!!,indoctrination school right here,Where were you over the summer?,I just find it hypocritical that during the BLM riots it was the “will of the American people” and should be supported::: but now it’s a so wrong and we all suddenly need to unite. It was and is all wrong no matter what political side you stand on.,B.S.!,Lmao antifa much?,This is a vile::: liberal breeding ground::: not a top flight university.,Comparing with those events in summer::: the one happened today in DC is peaceful. The biggest difference: in summer::: many people broke into stores::: took away all kinds of stuffs. Today::: a few of people broke into a capital building::: took some photos.,Susan Schultz,"Where were all your posts disavowing the violence from Antifa and BLM? Oh::: right::: you were teaching your students to glorify that cause and its participants. Pathetically::: you are now a university that represents socialist::: leftist::: nihilist doctrines; and you are tragically indoctrinating a generation of marxists/
communist students. Shame on you U of M.",UofM::: the college with an entire administration dedicated to control speech on campus::: yet says nothing when Antifa burns down a dozen US cities and their propaganda department::: now all of a sudden::: is against peaceful protests? May I also mention that the weather underground was birthed on campus and all they did was bomb the pentagon and the leader went on to mentor future President Obama.,I used to live & breathe U of M. I was fortunate enough to get a top notch education in the late 70s/ early 80s when there wasn't indoctrination going on (at least not in my classes). Over the years I have been a loyal alum and donor. That all stopped the moment I saw Obamas being courted and all of the other left leaning BS going on. If I could ask for my donations back::: I would! Know this: I will NEVER contribute another penny::: nor will I ever return to Ann Arbor.,Where were these statements a when blm was burning down cities and destroying businesses. Why do liberals hate America?,The swamp runs deep,Tyler Konkle 💙💛,He was to busy supporting the Democrats version of law and order!,Wow. I am so disappointed in my Alma Mater. Back in the 60's we learned sound economic principles that are now being brushed aside as socialism is embraced. Have we learned nothing? Socialism has failed everywhere it has been tried. When society provides no incentive to succeed::: no one succeeds. The old adage that with hard work you can achieve anything becomes meaningless. Shame on you University of Michigan.,Spewing your leftist garbage again. You won't be satisfied until we ARE the CCP.,Hypocrite.,"Ann arbor isn't the problem::: it the powers that be::: the regents::: the boosters::: the administration.
...once upon a time there was no better place to me on this earth! I will forever be GO BLUE ALL DAMN DAY! That being said::: when they hired shitstickissle from ivy league college I knew we were screwed!!!",STOP GIVING TO U of M. This statement sucks as bad as your football team!,I didnt hear you spouting off when blm was burning and looting.,"What a bunch of crap.

Ahh. Liberals. Your party leadership has committed treason. Your party is the puppet of China. Your presidential nominee is owned by China. Congratulations
. You've crippled your own country. Conservatives didn't do this. Your party did. They accosted people in restaurants::: their homes::: on the street::: in their churches. They themselves stormed the Capitol and supreme court. Not one objection from you. Your illustrious leaders fomented this behavior. Maxine Waters called for it. Your party shot and wounded a Republican representative.

In cities like Kenosha::: WI. the national guard was called in last couple nights afraid of the Democrat party's militant wing and their rioting... You know::: just like Portland::: Seattle::: Minneapolis::: and other cities they've ruined.

And now you complain? Hysterical.

Here's the difference. Much of DC will be cleaned up when they're done.",Of course we condemn today's violence in D.C. just as some of us condemned the violence this past summer committed by Antifa and BLM. Violence should be condemned no matter who is committing it; no matter which side of the aisle. But::: as we know::: this standard is not applied across the board. And::: remember::: the violence this past summer was much::: much worse and resulted in people's deaths and the loss of people's businesses.,Ya think ???,But::: Antifa violence in Portland was the “summer of love”::: right??,They asked for it::: they got it.,"Is it the will of the people to send billions and billions of taxpayer dollars overseas while American citizens are begging on street corners for money so they can eat ?

As a 30 year taxpayer I can tell you it’s not my will...eliminat
e all foreign aid and fix your football team::: please",Send it to Antifa/BLM as they were the ones breaking in dressed to resemble Trump Supporters. You probably know their leaders since you are liberal trash also. I am so ashamed of the Univ. of Michigan::: and the choices for President they have made.

Hey. This is something I feel that needs to be PUSHED for HARD at u of m & elsewhere AROUND THE WORLD.

I've been asking for people to share my facebook posts especially the ones from today::: because I really need them to go viral & be seen by large amounts of people at or around the same time...but people frequently ignore my requests.

U of M & other medical facilities NEED to STOP giving medications & start actually TREATING the underlying CAUSES for symptoms of depression etc and mental illnesses!!

It is my opinion or knowledge I should say::: really::: that they need to begin having people who come in for help in the psychiatric hospital or are inpatients listen to these binaural beats.

Have them meditate & Do yoga. Music therapy. Eating healthier & less meat.

In my opinion Delonis & other places that impact the homeless community greatly needs to enact a change in their menu to provide better food that has better nutritional value.

If you feed people a steak::: vs giving them avocado. There is a difference in the affect that meal will have.

Food and nutrition is one of the top things that can affect someone either positively or negatively.

The food you eat::: how it is prepared::: etc. That all matters and can affect MOODS of a human being in negative or positive ways.

These hospitals and doctors need to encourage those suffering or struggling with mental ""illness"" to do healthy things like writing in journals. Art therapy. Incense & aromatherapy.

Use what is enjoyable & calming & soothing to assist these people.

Delonis could benefit people a lot from using soothing::: soft music playing there::: like this video I sent to you.

Aromatherapy would be very helpful and beneficial there::: like a diffuser with essential oils.

Letting people do art on a regular basis and having access to art supplies at any time.

Things tha
t provide healthy & natural outlets for stress::: grief::: emotional issues..

They need to start actually MEETING the peoples health needs and spiritual care is super important to those who suffer from mental ""illness"".

Meds cure nothing at all. They don't even frequently help people cope! It is such a waste.

These issues that they ""treat"" with pills can be SOLVED if they TREAT them properly & adequately!

No more fucking BANDAIDS to this issue!!

There is a CURE FOR MENTAL ILLNESSES.

I'VE EXPERIENCED IT MYSELF MANY TIMES.

After being traumatized victimized terrorized demonized.....r
e traumatized over and over again...

These HEAL & help recovery of parts of the brain that are or have been damaged by things like trauma and conditioning.

And I know that without a doubt they work.

Many of these doctors know it too but they are pushed & pressured to diagnose::: prescribe & over prescribe.

Many of them fall victim to the pressure of those who are deemed or seen as being ""higher up"" or ""more powerful"" than they are & they crumble under the weight & pressure & succumb to it.

This also needs to STOP. It is causing damaging effects to all walks of life and all people. Across the board::: it is.

I say. Remove the vs. And shake hands across that line. If everyone just removes the vs between them. There is no more DIVISION there will only then be unity the main thing it takes is communication and understanding.

A commitment to do what's right & best bc I really do not think anyone enjoys doing wrong or bad.

Pills & medications are not the answer to most of these situations.

Doctors need to stop covering for hospitals and hospitals need to stop covering for doctors too.

This is super important.

Of course my mind is always on the issues and how we can solve them.

I hope to see & experience a world without issues!

Happy New Year To You::: Lauren!

Blessings To You & To Your Family & To Your Friends & To Everyone!

Stop pushing PILLS and give people REAL RELIEF FROM THE ISSUES THEY SUFFER FROM!!!!!!!!

U OF M COULD BE THE POSTER CHILD FOR A NEW WAY OF TREATING AND DEALING WITH MENTAL ILLNESS.

FOCUS AND PUT YOUR HEART AND HANDS TO WORK FOR THE BENEFIT AND GOOD OF ALL PEOPLE!!!!!!!!",It’s gonna be a picnic....,Good 2021!,Happy New Year!!! to all Current and former Michigan Students and Staff.

Why take a 30 million dollar bailout while michigan businesses struggle. I know college is a business but come on::: billions in endowments and taking bailouts?,"I was in a similar situation: the so-called ""low risk"" group but ended up in the hospital with pneumonia. This is serious and it's a shame that some people downplay it. Being hospitalized and experiencing debilitating symptoms is not something you would want upon yourself. Unfortunately::: sometimes you become exposed through circumstances beyond your control::: such as working in a healthcare setting. People need to be vigilant and mitigate the risks of infection and transmission. And::: as the interviewee stated::: being young does not mean asymptomatic.",Wow! You’re a special kind of ignorant!!!,Troll,so dangerous that you put your student athletes at risk so you can make money.,"Thank you for sharing your COVID story.

or Vitamin D supplementation. This is also part of the reason in the northern hemisphere every year we see “flu season” since there is generally less sunlight and hence drops in Vitamin D levels.

Even if I am not selected::: they hype with Harbaugh is OVER!!! His brother is a better coach!!!,"I’ve seen covid-19 compared to the 1918 plague many times. But the numbers are Skewed.

The population back in 1918 was only 1.8 billion. Our current population is over 7.6 billion. So when you adjust the death rates in 1918::: which was 50 million estimated. Then take our population in 2020. Adjust for the population differences with simple math. You will find out::: That plague would kill over 200 million plus in 2020.

Obviously::: measures to contain said plague::: were different back then. So was our medical knowledge and technology. But thats a debate for another time.

We are currently standing At 1.61 million dead world wide. The 1918 Plague lasted 2 years. If you do the math. COVID-19 will not reach 50 million dead in two years.

That is the number that died back in the 1918-1920 plague::: Let alone the adjusted death number’s for the population difference. The survival rate for Covid-19 is also incredibly high. Far higher then the 1918-1920 plague was::: with a much smaller population.

Again if you adjust for the population difference::: that plague from 1918 would have a 89.45% survival rate in 2020 with the difference in population.

That is the rough mathematical calculation with given information via the internet. With cross referencing to try and get accurate numbers.

Instead of just blindly listening to others or the media::: I choose to research on my own. This is what I came up with. So now I have to say it. Why on earth are we panicking.

I know it exists and I know it can be deadly. But our response does not match the numbers. Our response is extreme::: almost like it had a 50% death rate. Which if it did::: I would say we need the extreme!

But numbers do not lie unless the numbers were wrong in the first place.

April 25::: 2009: The World Health Organization (WHO) declares a public health emergency of international concern.

June 11::: 2009: WHO officially declares the new 2009 H1N1 outbreak a pandemic.

October 5::: 2009: The first doses of monovalent H1N1 pandemic vaccine are administered.

I had all the diseases like measles::: mumps - and still have high antibody titers - and in principle trust natural immunity more. But COVID-19 has made many people suffer for months - even if the fatality rate is only 0.5%::: the morbidity - of people having symptoms that makes them often unable to work is up to 40% - that is decidedly different and much worse than flu - even if the mortality may soon be similar (if we all could get the VIP treatment that Christie::: Trump::: Giuliani and Carson got.

The cases of transverse myelitis were with the AZ vaccine::: which is only 62% effective::: maybe 70% as they claim. For that vaccine::: I would also rather wait. That was not a side effect in Moderna or Pfizer vaccines.

We’re grateful.,How about having a speaker that says otherwise,When I signed up for the Pfizer trial I agreed to the 2 years follow up. Nothing in the agreement stated it would remain blinded. In fact my phone interviewer::: the site interviewer and even the nurse administering the shot (as well as the nurse with the 2nd dose) all said that when it came to market it would be unblinded. I specifically asked what 'coming to market' means and the all (and I mean all) said when it gets EUA. The success of EUA was on the backs of the trial participants. Promises unkept erode confidence.,Go Brady Go,Frederick Evans,No thanks. I’ll take my chances with the virus that::: for most of the general population::: is no worse than the flu.,The more people who refuse to wear masks and won't take the vaccine is great news. It will help reduce the number of foolish and ignorant people in the population,Not taking it. Dont need it,Has the vaccine been tested on children?,"""Funny"" how the people who cry the most about the shutdowns are the same ones who refuse to do anything that mitigates the spread.",I assume people who take the vaccine will be so much less likely to spread the virus to more vulnerable people. Just a thought.,Yeah no thanks.,"Help me understand::: UMich: Once I get my two doses and wait::: say::: a month::: I understand we will still be masking up for some time. If I am to be 90+% protected::: am I wearing the mask to protect myself from the remaining 10%? Even if I’m vaccine-protect
ed::: can I still be a carrier and give it to others? If all my friends and family are vaccinated::: can we visit each other’s homes maskless?

"The quality of life is important to people suffering from traumatic brain injuries (TBI) and oftentimes those caring for people with TBI are overlooked. A new study by Michigan Medicine uses a unique tool to help understand the experiences and the impact on the mental health and well-being of caregivers of people with TBI. myumi.ch/r8Qy2

Understanding Quality of Life for Caregivers of Persons with Traumatic Brain Injury",12/3/2020 0:00,"Dr Margarite Griesz-Brisson MD PhD is a leading European neurologist and
neurophysiologi
st. In October 2020::: she warned that rebreathing our exhaled air::: because of
wearing masks::: will create oxygen deficiency and an excess of carbon dioxide in the body.
‘We know:::’ she said::: ‘that the human brain is very sensitive to oxygen deprivation. There are
nerve cells in the hippocampus that cannot last longer than three minutes without oxygen.’ Dr
Griesz-Brisson pointed out that the acute warning symptoms of oxygen deprivation are
headaches::: drowsiness::: dizziness::: difficulty in concentration and slowing down of reaction
times. The real danger is::: however::: that when the oxygen deprivation becomes chronic::: the
symptoms disappear because the body gets used to them. However::: efficiency remains
impaired and the damage to the brain continues. ‘
Children and teenagers must never wear masks:::
partly because they have extremely active and adaptive immune systems but also because
their brains are especially active and vulnerable. The more active an organ is the more
oxygen it needs. And so the damage to children’s brains is huge and irreversible.
She warns that dementia is going to increase in ten years::: and the younger generation will
not be able to reach their potential because of the mask wearing.
Oxygen deprivation adversely affects the heart and the lungs but it also damages the brain.
And the damage will be permanent. ‘My conclusion has to be that no one has the right to force us to deprive our bodies of
oxygen for absolutely no good reason. Depriving individuals of oxygen is a crime perpetrated
by those demanding that we wear masks. Those who let it happen and those who collaborate
are also guilty",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many Families Unwilling to Skip Thanksgiving Gatherings During COVID-19",11/25/2020 17:00,No fuckin duh,We are not promised the next breath. Enjoy family while they are here. Young and old could be gone in a flash and I am not willing to lose that time for a virus that has a vey high survival rate.,I don't have a family or anyone likely to invite me to an in-home gathering of any sort. For the past 20 years I've spent Thanksgiving in a restaurant first with my mother and Betty::: then just with Betty. The past three years I brought takeout to Betty's bedside. I take some calculated risks not to spend too much time alone in my apartment. I consider (for myself) having to spend Thanksgiving alone a fate worse than death so I made a date to meet a friend at a restaurant. We will most likely eat indoors because it's raining. This will be the first and probably the last time I eat indoors at a restaurant. My friend has a COVID test every week because she works at an assisted living facility. The inside of this restaurant has a perimeter of tables where there are not tables next to each other horizontally (hard to describe) so I will be facing my friend but other people will have their backs to our backs.,🦃🙏,So they can blame Trump if they get it,You are correct.

S*** if you already live with your in-laws and there's five of you in a house and that's all that's ever been This isn't about them.

If you have a network of people that you've only been around and those people are the only people that have been around you that's not what's in question either.

I'm assuming the only issue is is that going to see a family member that lives somewhere else that you haven't been around in a while otherwise spending the same time in your house with the people that have already been in and out of your house for the last couple of weeks or months... Is not going to spread covid in your house currently. That's simply a fear tactic.Unless of course you've got people that are seeing more friends and being loose with how they protect themselves then that might be a bit more of a concern but overall if you stick to your same core family members that you still see on a daily basis you're fine Don't be fear-mongered into thinking you can't spend time with people that you've already been spending the last couple of months around..

I’m getting vaccinated.,I am getting it when it comes out. I trust the integrity of all the scientists and the people who took a personal risk to test the new vaccine.,Ignorance. Pure ignorance !,Yes for sure,Screw Pfizer.,"The flu vaccine has been around 78 years..
And guess what? So has the flu.
Smh.",You have American company making the vaccine made in American,You'd be crazy if you got the first try of the vaccine. I'll wait a little::: I have more faith in my body fighting it off.,61% of detroiters are the reason we are in this situation AGAIN. Just sayin..,George Sboukis,Lmfao yet you ALL supposedly voted for Biden 😂🤣😂 VAX up bitches!!!,here is your democrat sheep dip!,Great news. Warms my heart knowing the majority arent sheep,Shame on the politicians that put fear and doubt into people’s minds. Option-take vaccine and worry in far future of side effects or get covid and hope to live another day,👏Yay! More for us sane people!! All you non-vax folks can go ahead and be sick and die!!!👋,Timothy Micheal Murphy,Timothy Micheal Murphy,Timothy Micheal Murphy,Timothy Micheal Murphy,Why not::: most of you dummies love lockdowns and worship whitmer,I'd do the Vaxxart oral::: but definitely not injection,But they voted for Biden::: the man who pushed for these vaccines.,Garbage like the flu shot,A rushed vaccine from a company that is free from any and all lawsuits if things go wrong...... I’ll wait,Good for me the front line workers will be first. Hope it's good for them. Unfortunately 45 has intentionally compromised CDC::: FDA. There is no trust right now,I will where is it,All politicians take it first and if they are alright after 3 months then maybe try it on everyone else.,My body my choice.,I can’t wait for the vaccine but I think we will be wearing masks for a long time until everyone or a high percentage are vaccinated,Given how rushed it is::: to be honest I'm kind of hesitant myself. I understand the urgency of such a vaccine::: but it still makes me a bit uneasy.,Good! Keep it that way so no one gets it we don’t need a vaccine!,It’s ok. Gretch will just keep us locked down anyways,"“STOP LIVING IN FEAR!!!”

We all took the polio vaccine::: measles::: rubella::: mumps::: shingles::: flu and pneumonia vaccines. I’m ready. 👍,0% chance here....

But the dam greedy pharmaceutical and our government knows there is no money to be made,I won’t be getting it...right away. A vaccine this rushed To development makes me very uneasy. I’m not anti vaccine at all::: but I am for a delayed approach that makes sure we can see which vaccine causes a reaction::: if it does. And I’m also for making sure that it’s a truly tested and safe vaccine. We all know there’s an immense pressure to get a vaccine out::: which could definitely lead to shortcuts.,Yeah::: no thanks,Only way I’ll get it is if it’s mandatory to attend events.,I absolutely will. Once trials are peer reviewed and ok’d by the FDA.,Great!! My 87 year old Mom wants one. So do I. More for us!! 😁,Good.

Testing is very important to minimize or eliminate side effects. There is NO WAY I am going to take a vaccine rushed into production in a matter of months. I will take my chances with the virus and it's 99.8% survival rate.,Why would they? Vaccines take years not months...,Y'all really trust the Trump admin to properly vet this thing?,"well with the side effects::: pain::: discomfort they say you will have with it plus frontlines need to be out of 3 days twice in a months time to get it::: plus them saying masks and social distancing will have to continue...what
is the point?",Just wait. It won’t be long before employers make it mandatory. I hope I’m wrong::: but this will be pushed by the Government. Airlines are already jumping on the vaccine bandwagon. No vaccine::: no world traveling. Hang on::: this is just the beginning. Stay safe and healthy.,I am going to wait. I am a remote worker::: I know the vaccine won't be out in full mass for a while::: I want to make sure those that have to leave the house for work and be on the front lines get it long before me the IT guy in my cave gets it since they need it more,Wow,Why do we need a vaccine if masks work?,Demonrat stooges. They bought the Biden/Harris line that any Trump vaccine was unsafe. I live in Metro Detroit::: and if they all croak::: I'm fine with it.,A PART OF SCIENCE. It's possible both vaccine or more::: if effectiveness of vaccine more than 90 %. Most important safe::: no induced mortality and without side effect. Thank you.,Trust the government? Lmao::: Come on now,I will get the Pfizer's vaccine maybe. They are not funded by the govt.,We may get another 500:::000 deaths then.

Only a fool wouldn’t protect themselves,No mask no shot no problem. I'll risk it. My body my choice,Morons,Hell no my choice. It’s my body .. my freedom.,Well people are generally stupid so ...,Not me.....,Well yeah. You dont need a vacation for something that has a 99.9% survival rate. Also because of the media and the fear they have been pedaling for the last 3 years no one trusts them or government now because of the media or fake news.,Trust in Government is very low.,"Shithole Detroit?..shock

I hope Americans are watching the Democrats as they once again block COVID relief from moving forward. Senate GOP has tried multiple times to pass a targeted::: fiscally responsible bill that would help Americans in need of *immediate* relief. Democrats have blocked every attempt.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday downplayed chances of Congress passing a big new economic stimulus bill before the election::: even as Democrats voted to block a slimmed-down GOP relief measure in the Senate.

The vote in the Senate was 51-44 along party lines::: well short of the 60 votes that would have been needed to advance the approximately $500 billion measure. It was practically the same outcome as last month::: when Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) tried to advance a nearly identical bill in the Senate.

Senate GOP leaders argued that their approximately $500 billion bill was the appropriate response::: and would have provided at least some help to needy Americans who’ve been waiting months for more relief from Congress as layoffs mount and coronavirus cases rise.

Someone who lives in a dorm next to a sick person can’t get tested?,〽️ #HAIL 💙💛 #GoBlue ][\\/][,Go blue,Ummmm...😬,Alex Gee,Disgraceful! Should be ashamed of themselves. Buckled under big Republican money🤦‍♀️,I don't care.....this is not a season,Guess they didn't want to lose $100 million per school,Alum here who thinks this is a horrible decision.,GO BLUE!,Who cares? College or pro football playing does not pay my bills. I do not have the time to pay attention.,Yahoo! Go blue!,Football is back when you have people on strike? I am disappointed on how U of M is handling things.,As an alum::: I am so disappointed in this decision. I trusted that Michigan would do better to protect the community::: and particularly marginalized populations. You really can no longer claim to be the “leaders and the best.” I am no longer proud to be associated with UM.,Whelp there goes a third generation legacy. Probably couldn't afford to to send my kid anyway but still going to advise they go somewhere else.,If the football team can't beat OSU then why even bother?,Disgusting,Really stupid idea,This is a financial decision not a decision based on health and safety. Appalled as an alum. Did you consult your own school of public health scientists?!!! Bet they said go back to your room!,So excited,And Theres Karen::: aka Michele Carito::: bringing in politics to college football. Go back under your rock::: no one cares what YOUR opinion is Karen.,GOOD,Not a fan. Football should be a dying sport. Let it die.,Terrible decision and so irresponsible.,Woo! Hoo! Another year to get embarrassed by Ohio State!,Woo Hooo !!,Silly idea,"http://chng.it/
JMbvHLV4 SIGN",A willfully negligent::: greed-informed decision. A disappointment.,While this is fun and all::: I can’t help thinking that somebody will die from this. Not one of the players::: they’ll just get sick and be perhaps permanently crippled with Covid lungs. But their parents and grandparents at Thanksgiving? Watch out!,Great... Now we have to witness getting smashed by OSU another year. I never wanted to see Fields again.,You can't keep your students safe in the dorms::: the Dance building has shut down::: the quarantine housing is a disgrace::: GEO AND RA's are on strike. But by all means focus on football.,Will tailgating be allowed?,Tammy Salamey,Chris Sturgeon did you see this???,Ehh,Go Blue!!!! The guys have worked hard and deserve to play! The authorities have taken all the necessary precautions::: nobody tested positive in August::: and nobody this month. Give them a chance! I'm sure once they start::: if guys start testing positive::: then they'll do the right thing. I used to think Michigan fans were the greatest::: but all I ever hear is another year losing to OSU. If your a fan::: then your a fan::: win or lose! GO BLUE!!! 💙,Greed over safety.,GO BLUE!!!,Craig Paridy there goes your golf schedule,Was this really in the best interest of the students? Not at all. I hope everyone can stay safe and healthy.,Grayson Tishko,Great and what about the students that are now being given a reason to gather in groups. Will they have access to rapid testing? It would probably be safer to let 25:::000 students into the big house with masks and socially distanced to watch the games then in groups all over Ann Arbor.,Shameful. Cannot believe the university is publicizing this decision in celebration while continuing to endanger its students,Bring this energy to good faith bargaining with the Graduate Employees.,"As a parent of an OOS freshman and marching band member (from California where we are still pretty much locked down)::: there are so many pieces to this puzzle. One is that football and basketball pay for almost ALL other sports. It is not the ticket sales::: it is the TV package. So if tailgating is not allowed::: and no fans or even students attend games::: the big money TV still comes in. When the PAC12 announced no Fall sports::: Stanford University::: the school with the most NCAA championships in all sports::: immediately eliminated::: permanently::: about 6 sports::: including men's volleyball which they are perennial championship contenders. That is a shame for all kids.

So while my better judgment tells this is probably not the best move for long term control of the virus::: having any season might just save the lacrosse or field hockey teams.",Even with a vaccine obviously not everyone will get it so how can you keep anyone safe even then?,I am so excited!! We need some normal in our life !,"As a football fan I'm happy. As a concerned citizen::: I worry that playing even only against conference foes::: this will endanger and expose more people then are involved in the games.
In my opinion::: and it's only my opinion because I don't know all the facts or figures. It comes down to one of two things why they allowed them to play. 1: this pandemic although real and dangerous to some::: is a hoax ( meaning the numbers are all a lie). Or 2: money. Bowl games bring in big money.
I'm probably wrong because again I don't have facts or figures they are using. Maybe it's just spoiled pampered atheletes once again getting what they want while everyone else is left high and dry.
The safety and well being::: of the student body should be their number one priority. Not someone's draft status in the nfl draft...","Do we know yet if they will allow spectators into the stadium? Even a social-distanci
ng number of people?",I'm sure there's very good lawyers out there watching and waiting,What about marching band?,It took you long enough.,"As an alum (BM'82) I'm simply fed up. Some thoughts: 1) I wonder if ""no fans in the stands"" will apply to people who use the luxury boxes? 2) Indeed::: what ABOUT marching band? 3) The older I get::: the less connected I am to ""the U"". You know what? Outside of my classmates and friends from various groups::: and the occasional alumni get-together for a Saturday football game...",Keeping our kids safe::: and the players are kids::: should be our first priority.,"Will it be.. better than ever before? Because this kind of seems like a biggly move.

An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Oh::: wait. That's right. There is no COVID cure. There is only prevention.

Be prepared to reap what you sow::: my alma mater. 🤷‍♂️🙇‍♂️",Oui !!! GO BLUE 💙,"Look at the knuckle-draggin

This is why America shouldn’t AND can’t have nice things.",Go Blue,Still worried gut GO BLUE!!,Dana Green,Hahaha another wasteful season of losing.,Go Blue!!!!,It’s going to be a sub par product... see ya next year,This is just fucking stupid.

Each year in memory of those who lost their lives on September 11::: 2001::: members of U-M’s ROTC programs stand guard at the flagpole on the Central Campus Diag as part of a memorial vigil.,9/11/2020 18:28,"19 years ago::: this Wolverine was in shock as I evacuated my office in Pittsburgh and went to retrieve my 2 year old at daycare.
I had been alerted by friends that there was a plane ( Flight 93) that may be headed for Pittsburgh after the twin towers had been hit.
It was that day:::feeling helpless and wanting to do anything to help and not feel so useless::: the concept of Homefront Hugs was born.

We began one month later on 10/11/01 in honor of our heroes on the frontlines and our nation as we stood united::: one nation::: ready to heal and support our heroes without conditions. My Jewish grandfather had taught me so much about love against hate and honoring our WWII troops who saved so many::: this was in honor of all our heroes.

We have lost too many to suicide since 9/11 and every day we try to make a difference one hero at Homefront Hugs Foundation

Remembering all those lost today 19 years ago::: and how our country came together with allies worldwide. There was no room for hate or bitterness against any religion or group.

I was holding my little boy::: wondering how I would bring some meaning to this one day. His Daddy was a pilot in the Air Force. I wanted him to understand what heroes do. I wanted him not to hate but to help. And so it began.

We need to remember this again during this pandemic. Together we heal and get through this if we reject the divisions. Your help is gratefully accepted if you can donate or volunteer.",NEVER FORGET,At least 16 U of M alumni were lost there that day.,👏🏻👏🏻 🇺🇸🇺🇸 💛💙,Thank you to U of M ROTC for protecting our great country 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸,🇺🇸,ROTC peeps need to guard those flags cause the rest of the shitty people in A2 will step on them unless its a blm flag.,Kudos to the ROTC,David M Frieberg,I write here as an alum from France. Although I often disagree with whatever happens in the USA I felt horror on that day watching this attack from afar. Learning today that quite a number of the victims were alumni from U of M makes me feel very sad. But tell me::: what of those who ordered this horrific onslaught? Who? Who are they? This is nagging me.,Austin Colbert,How wonderful to see them honoring those we lost 19 years ago today; thanks for posting these photos::: U. of M. Our ROTC programs are so important and the young men and women who choose this rigorous path are a very special and dedicated group of people. They're our future officers and leaders. May God bless them::: our military::: and our great country always. 🇺🇸,Thank you so much for taking the time to remember the fallen hero's on an extremely sad day!!

What the hell is wrong with people in this country nobody seems to be able to think straight..they make up s*** in their head and then write articles and put it out there for people to read it makes no sense..

Trust me children are going to be just as much of spreaders with this virus as any other ...Jesus effing Christ

I truly believe the powers-that-be are insane something went wrong nobody has the ability to do critical thinking anymore.. they keep trying to make this virus to be something that it isn't. give this virus to children to incubate in and see the damage it does",Because kids can't vote so they are not the target audience.,Liberalism,Computer science assignment writing is a strenuous process and most of the students require help on the subject.

OFFICIAL: The Big Ten has postponed all fall competition due to COVID-19.

Complete information and the resulting impact on fall::: winter and spring sports is not known at this time.

The University of Michigan will decide on organized team and voluntary student-athlete activities as soon as information becomes available.

DETAILS » https://myumi.ch/9oPqN",8/11/2020 20:07,Sports is all we had left. This fall/winter is going to be rough::: especially for the midwestern snow states!! #covidsucks,Pussies,"Congratulations
for making the right and moral decision to safeguard your students an supporters!",Dang,People before profits. Well done B1G 👍🏼,Sheep🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂,Anthony Henry,Does that make us big ten champs? Lol I mean we did go undefeated,MSU will finally go undefeated,😭,Well::: whoever said osu wouldn't beat Michigan in football was right! lol,Upsetting but understandable,I’m sorry but this is the right decision!,What a joke........,Sad,At least we won’t lose to OSU this year.,Wait I thought it was cancelled..?,It NOT because of COVID-19 ::: it is because of fear! I would have never in my life thought that Americans would let the media & liberals play them as we are being played now! We have become a bunch of whiny cowards.,It is very sda::: but the correct decision medically.,Kind of surprised at this canceling. How will colleges make up the revenue they will loose? Expect the government to bail them out. I agree::: it is the flu. Protect yourself the same way you do every year when the flu is out. The media has blown this way out.,Roll over and play dead... One cannot imagine the ultimate harm that is being done in the name of safety. Where does this end and life begin again.,There is unfortunately no safe way for contact sports! Covid-19 kills!,That’s the right thing to do.,Someone needs to make the first call....,Looks like the ACC and SEC are playing football. If it works the BIG TEN will look foolish and there will be no football in the spring since a national championship will come from that group. Not much thought was put into the consequences of these presidents actions maybe they should be removed if this backfires on them. How many recruits will come to Michigan and how many will leave to play in conferences that use the same data and make better decisions,Rachel X Peng 快来看精彩评论,George Dillard,"Worst year of my exsistence.....
.",So sad,George Dillard,Well it looks like Michigan football will finally go undefeated in the fall!!,Let the ones play who want to play let the ones sit who want to sit. Stop acting on behalf of everyone.,"How does this affect those on scholarships???
How does it affect seniors since it would b their last year can they come back for one more season??? I’m upset by it and think it’s dumb but I am more concerned for how it affects them as students than men missing football",I think we just need to postpone life . Unbelievable!,"Complete bullshit...time
to watch SEC football",Wrong choice,...and yet more “control”,Follow the science they said . Know we know it’s not about the science,David,Hey OSU something came up can I reschedule my ass beating,Shame on you,Reality is you can't fill stadiums this fall until there is a vaccine. Besides football is a contact sport. In spite of all the precautions all it takes one or two players to contract it and screw up your season. A spring season can be the same as a spring practice.,Sad and glad. Keep everyone safe.,Disappointing- but Right thing to do.,No surprise there.,It's the right thing to do. As much as I hate missing Football::: keeping these young men alive is much more important.,If they are canceling all sports they better cancel all meet in person classes too.,Tom Richardson,😫,Say it isn't so!!!!😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭,Now we need MHSAA to follow suit and postpone. big ten has way more resources for testing get etc than public schools. They should take note.,How sad !!,Good!😷,I will miss you.,Shocker🙄,Aaron Pender,And Trumpy wanted them to play football. Dumb MF. Let the students die so he can attend a game and ignore what's going on::: on the field. Like he did last season.,😢But for the best.We got to get this virus kicked so we can get back to yelling GO BLUE at the Big House again. Will miss ya Wolverines this year still will always love my ❤Wolverines❤,Isn't safe to play football::: is safe to have face to face classes?? mmmmm,Who want to watch in the spring I wanted In the fall,Thank you for protecting these young people!!!! So very proud to be a Michigan fan!,Thank you for doing the right thing for the safety of the student athletes!,So disappointed ☹️,Terrible decision,Players are safer in a school teams atmosphere vs home atmosphere any day! Stupidity. How sad that this is our world and y'all made the decision to let Stupidity rule.,Wisdom prevails! 👍🏼🎉👏🏼😊Forever Go Blue💛💙😄,Protect them from losing to Ohio state,Disappointed to miss fall football season::: but absolutely the right call for protecting the community.,Sad but the right thing to do is never popular or easy,Disappointing but understandable,Weak sauce,Feel sorry for those students who got sport scholaships,Ugh. And how do these Facebook people know the details of the players home life?,Well::: it has made the liberal scaredy-cat's happy. 😆😆😆,Weak,A hard decision but better to decide on safety of players and fans. My husband will miss watching hours of football and I will too. 🙂,At least we don’t have to get trucked by OSU this year,Then the students shouldn’t be allowed back either,Exactly what needs to happen. Great move.,"""Postpones""::: eh?",Support my alma mater and their decision::: even if I feel sad not to watch fall sports. Thanks for making the safe call.

All of their talking points are factually and demonstrably incorrect.

I will attach screencaps of these facts to demonstrate as much. The changes in these states are so drastic that they’re now being reflected in the national aggregate numbers.

Oxygen suckers like the data deniers above are a threat to public safety and put blind ideological hackery ahead of all else. And most telling of all::: is that while these clowns spread misinformation and play cavalier with the lives of their fellow citizens and neighbors::: Republican governors in these states in the south that are experiencing these outbreaks are walking back their reopenings::: because they’re not so demented as to wash their hands of knowledge.

Corona Virus And The Decisive Statement That Is Not To Be Taken for Amusement

In the name of Allah The One::: The Perpetual Forgiver::: The Almighty::: The Overpowering::: blessings and peace be upon the chosen prophet Mohammed::: the messenger of Allah::: sent with the Reminder [The Quran] to all mankind.

O decision makers::: the leaders of man and their peoples in all countries::: I advise you of one thing only: - that you stand for Allah::: in pairs and individually::: and then give thought to who Allah proved his challenge to be true in reality with regards to the so-called corona virus!

Did Allah not challenge doctors altogether::: or did He challenge the awaited Mahdi::: the servant of Allah and His caliph the Imam Mahdi::: Nasser Mohammed Al-Yemeni? That is for you to know with certainty that you will never encompass anything of His knowledge except for what He wills::: Exalted is He and high above what you associate with Him and High above what you deviate because of being deluded by what you have of modern science.

And He has encompassed you with what the former people did not have the knowledge of::: then you became deluded concerning what you have of the knowledge of Information Technology and the knowledge in different fields and that is why He Has challenged you with what you do not have knowledge about::: which it is one of the smallest soldiers of Allah::: until He made your knowledge equal to zero::: O you who have rejoiced in the knowledge you have.

And you thought that you are capable of everything::: as a result::: Allah Has insulted your ability::: humiliated your pride::: and Has removed your vanity with the smallest soldier from his creation that cannot be seen by the naked eye due to its tiny size::: and that is for you to know the worth of yourselves.

Peace be upon the messengers::: and praise to Allah::: Lord of the worlds.

The caliph and the servant of Allah:::
Imam Mahdi Nasser Muhammad Al-Yamani

..Corona-virus is from the minor chastisement before the major chastisement so they may turn (to Allah)

In the name of Allah the All Merciful::: the Most Merciful::: Allah’s prayer of forgiveness upon His prophets and His loyal-servants in every time and place::: no fear for them from His chastisement nor they shall grieve..
Indeed::: so often we advised the decision makers; especially leaders of the Muslims::: and the disbelievers in general also those who turn away but they do not like the advisers. Anyway::: the deniers have disbelieved in Allah’s narration whether the atheists or the polytheists or the Muslims except upon whom my Lord has mercy from among them and he earned good in his faith::: surely I left you to Allah the One::: the Supreme::: Who made me Khalifa of His over the worlds to make me prevail against you by His way and His power. Confirming with the word of Allah the Most High: {So leave Me alone with him who rejects this announcement. We shall lead them on (to destruction)::: from where they do not know.(44) And I fill them (with false hopes)::: surely My plan is firm.(45)}Truth
ful Allah the Great [Al-Qalam] 68:44-45
{فَذَرْنِي وَمَن يُكَذِّبُ بِهَٰذَا الْحَدِيثِ ۖ سَنَسْتَدْرِجُه
ُم مِّنْ حَيْثُ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ﴿٤٤﴾
وَأُمْلِي لَهُمْ ۚ إِنَّ كَيْدِي مَتِينٌ﴿٤٥﴾}صدق
الله العظيم [القلم].

Verily::: here He is challenging you with the smallest of His soldiers that can not be seen by the naked eye::: then He shook (all) countries of the world; the great and small::: a major shake while it is a mere human virus that you do not encompass knowledge about it where from Allah invaded you by it with which Allah is challenging the entire human medical scientists. Surely by no means and they can never find an antidote vaccine for it as they claim::: no matter what they announced::: do not let them seduce you! By Allah::: they are indeed liars [although it is a tiny living creature from Allah’s hidden soldiers] even if the entire human medical doctors met for it; even if they were aiders and supporters to each other they can not and could never be able::: by Allah’s permission::: in order for you to know that you do not encompass a thing of His knowledge except in what He pleases::: glory be to Him::: but you are atheist people and you will indeed see what you did not expect from the scheme of Allah’s unknown soldier (Corona-virus) the suffocator. And Allah leads them on (to destruction) by means of His intelligent hidden way to get to whom Allah pleases of their elite from where they do not know::: and I see the world health organization do not consider it an international disease yet! In fact with their claim that they will control it::: they are indeed liars. How can they control Allah’s chastisement?!
But I am Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammad Al-Yemeni a khalifa of Allah over the worlds I issue fatwa to you with Truth that it is not a mere international disease in fact a global chastisement::: and since it is sort of minor chastisement before the major chastisement then definitely the death toll is few initially but now the infected ones are in the millions yet many of them do not know that they are infected::: and this is cunning from Allah so they infect other people they think themselves are secure from Allah’s chastisement suffocating the respiratory system::: so it would constrict him breathing air little by little as if he elevates up in the sky until he suffocates because of the constriction of his respiratory system and its channel::: so how Allah would not afflict the arrogant of whom Allah pleases from among them while they deserve the most to be burned therein? Those who turn away from the reminder of their Lord for they may return (to Him)::: and Allah would annihilate of them whom he pleases from among them as admonishment to the worlds for they may return back to their True Lord by pleading and supplicating to remove His chastisement away from them promising Allah to follow His Book the grand Quran and asking Allah steadfastness Who comes between them and their hearts so they would beseech from Allah to make their hearts steadfast to fulfill what they promised Him to avoid them His chastisement then removes it away from them to follow His Book the grand Quran so they be of these who are guided aright.

With what I want to seal this explanatory-sta
tement of mine is the call from Allah in His decisive Book during an admonition of His chastisement by the chest disease. Confirming with the word of Allah the Most High: {O people::: there has come to you indeed an admonition from your Lord and a healing for what is in the chests; and a guidance and a mercy for the believers.}Trut
hful Allah the Great [Younus] 10:57.. Surely this is a chastisement admonition::: a wisdom for the dutiful ones.

Survival is not a measure of ""success"" when permanent debilitating medical conditions are a frequent accompaniment::: even in those with mild to no symptoms::: even in younger people. And no::: this isn't the only way things could be done. The entire rest of the world did it better than us::: so there are a lot of examples of how wrong we've done it. Again::: I hope that most of the respondents on this thread so far are just Trump trolls showcasing their usual ignorance rather than actual U of M grads::: because if that's not the case then the quality of a UM education has dropped sharply!",A quick question. When did the large volume of testing begin? Is that factored into this graph? If it's accurate::: that's fine.

Less deaths are a sign things are going better.",Death isn't the only devastation it causes! Being alive is vastly different than living. It effects every part of the body::: can cause permanent damage in mild cases::: is very painful and takes months to recover but yea nothing to be concerned about!,Its highly geographic dependent and also so far leans towards natural immunity is more widespread than originally thought in certain areas.,Here we go again 😶,Carrie Lynn Stidham !!!!,Is the number treated relevant? To me it’s like asking how many total people were in the Trade Center Towers and comparing those lives lost as a percentage. 130k people dead so far this year. Does that death rate as a percentage of those treated mean anything - sincerely::: I’m asking. I am under the assumption that 130k lives lost and counting is enough to take serious action.,Bogus graph.,Go back to same level testing when we were flattening the curve?

It works. The data is out there. Ivermectin does too. And the auto immune suppressants if the patient is further along. This is treatable. We CAN get that mortality rate down.

Have Zinc and Quercetin on hand in case of exposure::: travel::: or crowd encounters.",Kiel Gloden,If stop testing then numbers will go down 😄🤡,My question is we are now seeing more daily cases than ever before. In the beginning they claimed the hospitals where overrunning with bodies and patients. How come we dont see that now?,"I’m seeing a lot of comments on posts about Covid 19 and wearing masks where “woke” people are trying to tell everyone to listen to the medical “experts” and just wear masks.

I’m wondering how many of those same people actually listen to medical “experts” and eat well::: exercise::: get proper rest::: control their weight::: stop smoking::: stop consuming alcoholic beverages::: stop using recreational drugs::: etc",Why are the deaths so high?,Or all this could be explained that we are testing alot more now so more are being found,Flattening the curve is about not overwhelming hospitals. How many of these confirmed cases are occupying a hospital bed?,Go about your life. People will die. Continue going about your life. More will die. That’s what happens.,If these comments are any indication::: we as a society are doomed.,This is bullshit.,Facts Matter! Science Matters! The Impeached leadership in Washington is Killing U.S.,But are the the number of deaths increasing?

People dont need to live in such hysterical fear!!!,Well researched vaccines take years to develop and test properly. Forcing a vaccine into the market without proper procedures is risking even more lives. I’m not anti vax I’m just pro choice and pro research. And the truth is that vaccines should not be rushed. We also cannot possibly social distance until a vaccine has been developed and proven safe! If you want to risk a vaccine that didn’t undergo proper trials::: be my guest. Otherwise::: understand that unfortunately the only other method is through natural heard immunity. I personally will continue to protect my family in the way I did before covid 19 when my daughter was diagnosed with immune deficiency. We will continue to avoid large crowds and dirty public places. We will continue to eat healthy::: wash our hands often::: use sanitizer when we can’t::: and mask up when in crowded or confined areas. We have been doing this for 5 months longer than the rest of the world. It is doable!! It’s common sense. When enough people (usually 2/3 of the population) has contracted covid 19 then there will be herd immunity. It’s actually incredibly simple science.,Each state has its own curve,And if there is never a vaccine available?,Everyone is fine. The average survivability rate is 95.6% if you do the math with a pocket calculator.,"come on guys...more tests=more positives...you
would think that an institution like u of m could come up with that bit of brilliance?",Why isn’t there a a graph that shows how many tests were administered to overlap::: so the mathematicians can easily do percentages?🤔,There's a rise of cases because there's a rise of tests. Doesn't matter. The odds are staggering that you'll just be fine even if you do get it. And just think::: I used to respect your school.,"Deaths are going down::: even with more cases.

We should be celebrating that ""herd immunity"" is being established without more deaths.","Overlay fatalities to see a true view.

When the Declaration of Independence was written::: it spelled promise for so many::: but the ideals of true equality and independence were imperfectly embodied.

Take the best thoughts and get on with your lives:::::: try and make a grand::: uplifting start as they did!,Unfortunately too many people weren’t taught true history. They totally glossed over slavery. Black people were not treated equally for years. They were used as collateral for cotton farms. They weren’t given the same opportunities at ownership of land::: education or jobs. Even as recent as the 1950s Jim Crow laws and inequality were still in place. We must educate ourselves and our children to ensure history doesn’t ever repeat itself and to finally make sure all people really are treated equally.,Well if people do not like our country::: the opportunities the founders created for us::: our way of life::: and our flaws you are welcome to leave. Nothing is holding anyone here. You cannot erase history. You cannot change history.

As time went on Black people could only buy houses in certain neighborhoods (redlining) even in the 1970s. Mortgage rates were different for Black people. Funding for schools even to this day is different for poor black neighborhoods making education different. There’s quite a bit of material out there.

Hope the nba wnba nfl mlb nhl hollowood and all destroy themselves from within protesting a lie. So lamebron and 'his people' are scared of police and they are the problem. I will pay for him and his team to walk down a street at night in Cleveland or chicago with their best clothes and jewelry on and lets see if the police are the problem.

Black lies matter say the reason why they protest one black criminal getting shot and/or killed by police and ignore the other 4500+ murders of blacks across the nation is because police are getting away with murder and others arent. Well there are almost 70% unsolved cases of the 4500+ murders of blacks. The actual reason why they protest police shootings is that black lies matter is looking for an excuse for failed lives and blacks murdering blacks by the 1000's cant be used as an excuse like police can. Doctors have raped little children and even murder people before but you dont see them being protested and the reason why is because they cant be used as an excuse for failed lives either. If anyone has a right to protest it would be the police and against black brutality since more police get murdered by black criminals than the other way around

The black lies matter movement is nothing more than hate and revenge covered by the words social injustice and racism

Because they can deny existence to make existence does not exit.

For example::: there have been some very brazen criminal Chinese invaders claiming they were narcotics police as they were sexually seducing woman with illusory drug & illicit drug with an attempt to rape as their method to struggle criminal black power & evil fortune. For another example::: there have been some very brazen criminal Chinese invaders insisting they did nothing wrong as they were perpetrating harassments & riots.

Therefore::: I think only those brazen criminal Chinese invaders are justified to be placed in laboratory experiments because these heinous criminals can deny existence to make existence does not exist. Thank you!

Even when classes went remote in March after fears about coronavirus became more serious::: I remember seeing students out partying—how are these measures going to counteract that? All it takes is one student who is sick attending a frat party::: having too much to drink::: taking off their mask::: and suddenly tons of people may be made sick.

And just to mention::: I’m sure many students will follow these guidelines and comply with protocol. The problem is the ones who don’t::: who may ruin it for everyone else.

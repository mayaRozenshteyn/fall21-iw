"The NYU Ability Project had already been working with the Intrepid Sea::: Air & Space Museum to make its exhibits accessible for people with physical::: sensory::: cognitive::: or behavioral disabilities when the pandemic hit. Safety concerns precipitated by COVID-19 suddenly shifted the focus from tangible (touch) interaction and the use of shared audio guides in the museum::: where visitors could no longer crowd around exhibit labels::: gather in small areas::: or use shared equipment.

The solution? The Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) Mobile Guide::: which allows attendees to use their phones to self-navigate and obtain information about the Intrepid Museum‚Äôs myriad attractions. ‚ÄúWe focused a lot on accessibility of the content::: like recognizing reading level::: thinking about translation to multiple languages::: thinking about audio descriptions for video:::‚Äù says Ability Project director Amy Hurst. She adds that all of it is on a website rather than an application because ‚Äúit‚Äôs much more privacy preserving and also really easy for the staff to update all the content.‚Äù http://spr.ly/6185Jp0QL",2021-11-07 14:54:00,üëç,üëçüëç,Aymen Al-Ghiryani,"MY BEST TRADING EXPERIENCE EVER

How will you do on that day? Here's a quick test: How many lies have you told in your life? Have you ever stolen anything? Have you used God's name in vain? Have you ever looked at someone with lust? Have you had sex outside of marriage? Have you ever had::: or been involved in::: an abortion?

Will you be guilty on Judgment Day? If you have done these things::: God sees you as a lying::: thieving::: fornicating::: blasphemer::: adulterer at heart::: and murderer::: and the Bible warns that God will punish you in a terrible place called the lake of fire: Revelation 21:8::: AV: ""But the fearful::: and unbelieving::: and the abominable::: and murderers::: and whoremongers::: and sorcerers::: and idolaters::: and all liars::: shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.""

Yet God::: who is ""...rich in mercy:::..."" sent His Son the Lord Jesus Christ to suffer and die on the cross for all guilty sinners. We broke God's Law and the Lord Jesus Christ paid our fine. That means God can legally dismiss our case and He can commute our death sentence. John 3:16::: AV: ""For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son::: that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life."" Then the Lord Jesus Christ rose from the dead and defeated death.

Please::: repent and trust in the Lord Jesus Christ as Savior::: and God will give you eternal life as a free gift: Ephesians 2:8-9::: AV: ""For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works::: lest any man should boast.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"üì∑üå±: Have you visited NYU's newest secret garden? This green wall‚Äîalso known as a living wall or vertical greenery system‚Äîin the lobby of @nyupublichealth's new home at 708 Broadway boasts a hybrid irrigation system::: plants that produce high oxygen levels::: and properties that create a unique sense of calm for passersby. If created in an urban environment and on a significant scale::: research suggests that a combination of green roofs and green walls may improve air quality and attenuate noise while promoting the health and well-being of citizens‚Äîsomething to celebrate as we close out Campus Sustainability Month.

‚ÄúNYU faculty research shows that people feel better::: work better::: and study better when they encounter green spaces during their daily lives. It‚Äôs vital to be reminded that nature is not just ‚Äòout there‚Äô in the woods somewhere. We still live in an environment::: even if it‚Äôs a human-dominated one::: and a green wall can remind us of that every time we pass it:::‚Äù says NYUGreen's Cecil Scheib::: NYU's chief sustainability officer.

The creators of the living wall::: an ever-evolving work of art::: selected various blooming plants to provide ""pops"" of color. Some examples are anthuriums::: the Mona Lisa lipstick plant::: and chocolate columnea. Several species‚Äîincluding aglaonema::: pothos::: and chlorophytum comosum (spider plants)‚Äîare among the plants that::: according to NASA research::: are believed to sequester VOCs::: filter air::: and produce oxygen.

‚ÄúThe inspiration behind our living Green Wall comes from the desire to emphasize the elements of life required to survive and thrive‚Äîearth::: water::: fire::: and air. We hope all who pass by it can benefit from its high oxygen levels:::"" says NYU School of Global Public Health Dean Cheryl G. Healton.

International Pronouns Day seeks to make respecting::: sharing::: and educating about pronouns commonplace. Referring to people by the pronouns they determine for themselves is basic to human dignity::: but many transgender::: non-binary::: and gender non-conforming people are regularly called by the wrong pronouns::: which causes erasure and marginalization.

Sharing your pronouns is an easy way to communicate with others how you‚Äôd like to be identified and signals to others to do the same. You can find other tips on pronoun use in our IG stories/highlights as well as pronounsday.org

God created the woman for man only and God instituted the institution of marriage between a man and a woman only. And God blessed and made Holy the Sabbath Day of rest for all created beings which is the 7th day of the week as His memorial to creation and all who keep the Sabbath Day Holy show allegiance to God. who said if you love me then keep my 10 commandments.

"Indigenous Peoples' Day is an opportunity to reveal historical truths about the genocide and oppression of Indigenous peoples in the Americas::: to organize against current injustices::: and to celebrate Indigenous resistance.

NYU Center for Multicultural Education and Programs (NYU CMEP) suggests recognizing the day by using these prompts to reflect on the land you occupy:

"‚ÄúWe are still gathering all the facts::: but at this point::: based on initial information::: we can say that around 3 p.m. there was a shooting incident in MetroTech Center in Brooklyn::: which is home to our School of Engineering. Our understanding is that the shooting was the result of a dispute that originated elsewhere in the vicinity.

‚ÄúA male bystander::: an NYU student who was standing outside in the MetroTech plaza::: was injured by a stray bullet or a ricochet. After being injured::: the individual proceeded into one of our buildings::: where he was promptly attended to by emergency responders and taken to the hospital. Our understanding is that the injuries were not life threatening::: and the individual did not lose consciousness. The police have declared the area 'clear:::' and NYU community members in the MetroTech area are able to resume normal activities.

‚ÄúWe are deeply concerned about the well-being of the injured student; the thoughts of the NYU community are with him::: as our profound wishes that his injuries are not too serious and his recovery will be swift. The University is sending personnel to the hospital to offer support and has been in touch with the student‚Äôs family.

‚ÄúThe University is also concerned about the occurrence of a shooting so near one of our buildings. We will be talking with city law enforcement authorities about the episode and what can be done to enhance safety in the area.‚Äù

NYU.EDU
Statement from NYU Spokesperson John Beckman About the Shooting Incident in the Vicinity of NYU Tandon",2021-09-21 21:20:13,I hope you are taking this incident very seriously. We have entrusted our precious children to you and I hope you will be able keep them safe. This is a phone call no parent ever wants to get!! Praying for the victim and family involved üôèüèº,"Please make our students‚Äô safety a priority üôè please increase the number of your patrols::: and communicate with NYPD to ensure the safety of our children I‚Äôm really concerned!
It‚Äôs essential to support the officers who are in charge of security",Looks like Washington Square Park isn‚Äôt the only area that needs more attention and security from NYU. Please up your patrols and work with NYPD to make NYU students safe,Go remote honestly,Thugs with guns have no place near the school.,So upsetting. I‚Äôm glad that he is okay::: though terribly traumatic.,As a parent I have to say I received a text immediately alerting of the incident and when it was safe for students to resume activities. Thank you NYU!,Please ensure that safety remains a top priority and not like Columbia university,Well you did say nyc is their campus‚Ä¶ comes with the good and bad and nyc has mostly become bad these days,"You can talk to city law enforcement all you want; they have lost funding::: have not been supported by the mayor::: and are apathetic at this point. NYU is a city campus with no gates or borders and will experience what the the rest of the city is going thru::: if not worse due to Washington Square Park‚Äôs demise.

Nothing will change until there is change in the mayor::: or you increase your own private security patrols in all of the areas of the city where NYU has a presence.

GEORGE WASHINGTON
Deemed the greatest man in the world by everyone
‚Å†
George Washington was famous for his humility::: and was revered as the ""Greatest Man in the World"" during his timeline according to scholars::: noblemen::: commoners::: and even the King of Britain whom he defeated in battle. He was also the most famous celebrity throughout the world causing people to line-up throughout the countryside just to see him ride past on his horse.
‚Å†
What the 400 British ships didn't see when they sailed into New York Harbor to defeat George Washington and his ""ragtag"" untrained Continental Army who were fighting for their independence from England's taxes and laws::: was Washington's faith in God and his humility ‚Äï the latter being his most noted characteristic of which people wrote about in their letters and diaries.
‚Å†
Even the other founding fathers agreed that George Washington was the best of them all::: a man with no formal education.
‚Å†
After Washington defeated King George III and his army after eight straight years of battling::: the King acknowledged Washington as being the best man in the world for turning down the opportunity to be ordained King (as many people wanted to see happen)::: and also for handing his devoted army back to the Congress which had never before then been done by a winning war General in order for him to return back to his farm and live out the rest of his life privately at his home although later::: he would be pressured to become the first President of the United States of America in order to continue spreading his noble::: wise and humbling influence.
‚Å†
Washington's army in theory::: should never have won the War for Independence (also called the Revolutionary War)::: but they did even though at times twenty-percent of the army went without shoes or clothing having to endure hot and freezing conditions including walking barefoot through frozen lakes::: cutting their feet on rocks::: and having only to eat ""firecake"" at times which is flour mixed water prepared in a kettle over fire thus causing many of them to die from starvation and disease when Washington somehow never got sick like the others did.

Over the years::: his army came to believe that Washington survived gunfire and disease because he was ordained by a higher-order like when a thick-mist appeared from nowhere blocking out everything in sight allowing the Continental army to escape an attack so they could regroup and strategize.
‚Å†
George Washington freed all his slaves before he died::: some of them had been inherited from his father during times when even African people were selling their poorest and least educated people under the justification that they weren‚Äôt like humans::: because they were primitive in culture and tradition.
‚Å†
It‚Äôs unfortunate that Washington::: and all the other good people couldn‚Äôt have afforded to purchase all the slaves and give them dignified jobs::: beautiful places to live::: and an educations like many did::: but there were about four million slaves in the end and nobody was rich enough to purchase them all::: especially after the invention of the Cotton Gin which rose America to being the producer of about three quarters of the world‚Äôs cotton.

This amassed some of the biggest fortunes during those times which caused many evil and greedy people to raise the price of slaves to 7 or 8 times higher AND it also posed more danger to slaves overall when talking about abolishing slavery during a time when the people making fortunes from it were never more power hungry who would rather see the slaves killed than become free as proven when they hunted down slaves after they were freed.
‚Å†
Washington's great friend Billy Lee was a black slave that Washington purchased and saved from a potentially horrible fate.
Billy Lee::: rode aside Washington for the 8-years they fought together as a best man and friend.
‚Å†
Fritz Hirschfeld a historian wrote that::: ""If Billy Lee had been a white man he would have had an honored place in American history because of his close proximity to George Washington during the most exciting periods of his career. But because he was a black servant::: a humble slave::: he has been virtually ignored by both black and white historians and biographers.‚Äù
‚Å†
George Washington::: top scholars::: innovators::: and the founding father‚Äôs who worked on developing the U.S. Constitution knew that the Constitution was better than them selves::: and that it was the best attempt to give power to the people NOT the evil that will ALWAYS find itself employed in government.
‚Å†
They all knew the slaves must be freed for the Constitution to become all that it was written to be::: but knew a gradual approach to freeing the slaves was the best way to protect them from being killed::: and to plan for their integration into society as free and equal people.

Many Africans came to America of their free will settling first in Portland::: the melting post of vast religions::: languages::: and foreign cultures getting along together and excited to be living and exploring the ""new world"" of which they didn't originally know was already inhabited by hundreds of Indian tribes::: some unfriendly like the Shawnee who captured and tortured one of Daniel Boone's sons to death::: and were known for scalping the much different looking foreigners.

Many of the tribes were friendly and showed the foreigners how to grow food and navigate through the uncharted and dangerous terrain::: some of them even partnered with the British by guiding them through forestry during the war.

Washington called the Constitution ‚ÄúThe Great Experiment‚Äù and I personally believe it is worth dying for::: just like our Bible is and ancient history which have been removed from public education.‚Å†
‚Å†
GEORGE WASHINGTON QUOTES:‚Å†
‚Å†
‚ÄúThe fate of unborn millions will now depend::: under God::: on the conduct and courage of this army.‚Äù‚Å†
‚Å†
To be prepared for war is one of the most effective means of preserving peace.‚Äù
‚Å†
‚ÄúGovernment is not reason and it is not eloquence. It is force! Like fire it is a dangerous servant and a fearful master. Never for a moment should it be left to irresponsible action.‚Äù
‚Å†
‚ÄúIt should be the highest ambition of every American to extend his views beyond himself::: and to bear in mind that his conduct will not only affect himself::: his country::: and his immediate posterity; but that its influence may be co-extensive with the world::: and stamp political happiness or misery on ages yet unborn.‚Äù

Patents and copyrights are stolen in our country
Ivan Str√°nsk√Ω Politics March 29::: 2019
Why do we act like a assembly plant and a herd of useful idiots?
This week I watched the American film Patent Dispute on Czech television. It was a melodrama - the life story of an inventor who::: as an employee of an automotive concern::: invented a simpler solution for a car wiper cycler at Ford. As we know::: courts in the US operate on the basis of jury decisions. I have seen a difficult struggle for patent verification::: with both parties to the dispute proving that the law is on their side. Just before the jury's expected decision::: the night before::: the employer's representative visited the inventor in his home and offered him an out-of-court settlement of $ 30 million (!). Contractually. After consulting with the family::: the dear inventor heroically refused. The next day::: the jury found that the plaintiff's legal claim was justified. And it ruled that Ford was required to pay the applicant $ 10:::390:::000. I do not know how in the United States::: but in our country this would never happen::: even in disproportionat
ely lower amounts. Let me explain why.
In our state::: it is very dangerous to bring into the world not only the idea of a technical solution (even disproportionat
ely more serious than a wiper cycler)::: but also to prove that you have the world's technical first. In order to discourage you from such a label::: the state will first incur high costs for administrative acts and opposition. Then he quite correctly objects to you with similar solutions that already have protection. You have to prove that what you intend to patent has nothing to do with it::: and besides::: it is not only better::: but completely new. As the whole event is of course very complicated and must have the right diction::: you have to hire a patent law expert to process the application and submit the opposition proceedings (in my case it was the renowned patent law office Ziegrroser and partner::: Prague).
If you do not do this and proceed yourself (eg your funds are not infinite)::: then you run the high risk that if your subject matter of the application really has the required novelty::: it is as if you were sending this application directly to competing entities. The Office for Patents and Inventions of the Czech Republic will reject it for formal shortcomings. This puts you in a situation where what you have created in the sweat of your face and in the long days::: weeks::: months::: etc. is thwarted.
Let's say you're with the money and you put it in the right places. You are far from winning! After long delays (usually years)::: the IPO of the Czech Republic will notify you that your world championship has been verified and you will be issued a protection patent document if you pay this issue and annual maintenance fees.
So if you are a new inventor::: you will get a predicate to it. Finally::: you buy a bottle of sparkling wine and celebrate with friends who understand what they have in you::: including a possible wife. (She is happy that the money::: which was not enough::: will be returned to the family.) Whoa.
The Industrial Property Office of the Czech Republic will do what it has to do. He will print the full description of your news in his journal::: including a translation into English. I don't have to elaborate on who and how follows these journals in the sense of industrial espionage. The world's manufacturers in your field will immediately find out the merits of the thing and read it nicely. Then find out how you're doing. Thus::: whether the described subject matter of the invention is protected in states other than yours.
Don't you? Great. They can copy and manufacture it. Do you have? Well::: that's a coincidence! You obviously had a stupid investor who paid for you - protection - because you need ""long"" money for that. But your stupid investor probably didn't realize that there are so-called modifications to the basic subject of the invention. (It must be saved::: even if it costs millions). The competition will engage their purchased brains and challenge them to bypass your subject matter with a similar modification::: with the playful handling of the evidentiary proceedings in court. (Your stupid investor didn't consider the possibility that he would also protect modifications to your basic idea::: where a certain group of modifications is called a ""nest"" by patent lawyers.)
Of course::: this costs a lot of money. And so the game of cat and mouse starts. Through lawyers::: you will contact the competition by proposing to transfer the license for their production of your subject matter of the protected invention. They have two paths used. The dead beetle method::: where they ignore your annoying challenges and refuse to negotiate a license. Or do you meet together and they kindly ask what you are asking of them? License fees? Incredibly! Yes::: they read it in the Journal. It is possible that their solution is similar. But they will not provide any payments. Don't you like it? Yes::: please resolve it in court. Prove to us that we are violating your rights. You know::: inventor::: we have a very capable legal representation:::
and we're used to that. In addition::: we have unlimited funding to protect our interests. We will advise you well: you will not win this dispute. What is the next act in this would-be operetta? There are two options. (1) Either clench your teeth with your investor and continue the lawsuit (unlikely). (2) Or your investor will ""wrap"" you","https://

"In a time of seemingly irreconcilable political polarization::: it can be hard to imagine how group and identity dynamics that so often seem to turn toxic could be used to bring us together. But research by NYU's Jay Van Bavel and colleagues suggests that it's actually pretty easy to harness human psychology to build healthy teams. ""The minute people are part of a team::: you can observe differences in their brain activity and behavior:::"" Van Bavel says. ""People are more interested in becoming friends with in-group members and express more empathy when they are in pain. We also find that simply being assigned to a mixed-race team can help overcome our biases‚Äîleading people to automatically feel more positive toward all of their in-group members.‚Äù

f6d9-s07.html","Anyone who understands the chemistry of anger can easily control it.

""What is the chemistry of anger?""
There are sixteen chemicals inside us. These chemicals shape our emotions::: our emotions::: our emotions determine our moods and these moods shape our personality. The duration of each of our emotions is 12 minutes. For example::: anger is an emotion. This emotion is caused by a chemical reaction. For example::: our body did not make insulin or it was less than necessary::: we ate too much salt. We didn't get enough sleep or we came out of the house empty stomach. What will happen if we have a chemical reaction inside us? This reaction will increase our blood pressure and this blood pressure will create anger in us. We will erupt but this eruption will only last for 12 minutes. Our body will produce anger-fighting chemicals after 12 minutes and so we will be down in the next 15 minutes::: so if we learn to manage twelve minutes of anger::: then Jim will avoid the ravages of anger.
""Is this prescription limited to anger only?""
No::: we have six basic emotions: anger::: fear::: hatred::: surprise::: pleasure and sadness. All these emotions are only twelve minutes old. We are scared for only 12 minutes::: we laugh for only 12 minutes::: we are sad for only 12 minutes::: we are hated for only 12 minutes::: we are angry for 12 minutes and we are overwhelmed by surprise Stays
Our body normalizes all our emotions after twelve minutes but most of the time we see people all day in a world of anger::: sadness::: hatred and fear. They are not normal all day::: so you look at these emotions like fire. There is a fire in front of you. If you keep pouring a little oil on this fire::: what will happen if you keep putting dry wood on it? This fire will spread and it will continue to burn.
In the same way::: most of us put oil and wood on our emotions instead of quenching them. If we don't manage even during the day::: that passion becomes our long mood and this mood becomes our personality.
Have you ever wondered why so many of us have surprise::: laughter::: hatred::: fear::: sadness or anger on our faces all the time?
The reason is obvious. The emotion knocked on his face for twelve minutes but he did not let it go and so the emotion became surprise::: laughter::: hatred::: fear::: sadness or anger became his personality. He was written on their faces forever. If these people had managed for twelve minutes::: they would have escaped the scourge of a lifetime. They would not have become slaves of any one emotion.
So let's learn how to manage these twelve minutes?
For example::: when I realized that my condition would last only 12 minutes::: I got up quietly::: performed ablutions and started praying. I spent 20 minutes on this process. In those 20 minutes::: my anger also subsided.
So should prayers be offered every time in anger?
""Absolutely not."" Whenever I am overwhelmed by an emotion::: I shut my mouth first. I do not utter a word. I go for a walk in the attack of fear::: anger::: sadness and pleasure. I do 'Wudhu'::: I fast for 20 minutes in silence::: I glorify Istighfar::: I try to relax myself by calling the person I like to talk to and try to relax myself by closing my ears and eyes. I go to bed or get up and pray. Twelve minutes pass like this. The storm goes away. My mind comes to rest and I am able to make a decision.
And what do I do if I don't have all these facilities?
I do not open my mouth when the sky falls or the earth cracks
I remain silent and you can be sure that no matter how big the tsunami is::: it cannot cope with the silence of man. He retreats anyway. You too can defeat all the storms of life by remaining silent.
Also::: here are some simple tips to share with you

When you are angry::: leave the scene for some time::: never respond immediately. Stop for five minutes in anger. This will largely control your words. If you are standing::: then sit down. Lying down means changing your position. This will also help you a lot in changing your mood. Drink water immediately because anger is actually fire. ÿ•ŸêŸÑŸéŸëÿß ÿ®ŸêÿßŸÑŸÑŸëŸáŸê) Read it. Anger will fly away immediately.

"We're so excited to welcome students to campus! A Move-In note for those in residence halls: To minimize lines and elevator trips::: and to keep everyone safe::: this year's motto is ONE HELPER::: ONE BIN::: ONE TRIP.

Only one person can accompany a student up to the room at a time. There will be a wrist-band available::: and only those visitors with a wrist-band will be permitted upstairs. Whoever goes upstairs with the student resident must be fully vaccinated or have had a negative PCR test within three days prior to Move-in Day.

NYU provides bins to help students carry their belongings to their rooms; the dimensions are typically about 19 sq ft. We‚Äôd like students to show up with no more belongings than can fit in the bin and be carried by hand in one trip in the elevator. The rest can be shipped.

"‚ÄúNeuroscience suggests that fear itself can be contagious::: but fear also tends to fade or decay.

"A word on the Delta variant::: mask guidance::: and more: NYU continues to require masking in indoor spaces. Given the emergence of the Delta variant::: we expect to continue that practice at least through the remainder of the summer::: and possibly into the fall.

The effects of the Delta variant are a sharp reminder of how unpredictable and challenging COVID-19 has been from the beginning. The best response? Get vaccinated as soon as possible. More: http://spr.ly/6189y50M5",2021-07-30 06:00:00,I thought all staff and students had to be vaccinated?,Nour good ol' maitland jones,has that blue bio book not changed in over 20 years???,Just a reminder that if you‚Äôre vaccinated::: you don‚Äôt need to wear a mask NYU.,A vaccine should free you from wearing a mask!,I wish to join but i cant i can't aford it,"Facts::: Accountability and Reflections:

While it is crucial that we all come together in this fight::: we cannot merely move on without learning our history or we will continue to make the same mistakes. As Ronald Reagan said::: ‚ÄúIt is time to restore the American precept that each individual is accountable for his actions.‚Äù

On February 25th::: 2020 during his visit to India Donald Trump promised that a vaccine would be available soon. ‚ÄúNow they have it::: they have studied it::: they know very much::: in fact::: we‚Äôre very close to a vaccine:::‚Äù

On February 28th Trump said at a press conference that the coronavirus will ‚Äúdisappear‚Äù like a ‚Äúmiracle‚Äù. Also in February::: he speculated that warm weather would kill the virus and stop its spread.

On March 4th Trump told Fox viewers that based on a hunch the death rate was a ‚Äúfraction of 1 percent‚Äù.

During that March 4th call with Sean Hannity::: Trump also compared coronavirus with the flu. He mentioned that the flu kills anywhere between 27:::000 and 77:::000 people every year::: implying that coronavirus isn‚Äôt as serious of a threat to public health as Influenza. He also calls Covid-19 ""corona flu"". He suggested it was fine for people with Coronavirus to go to work::: in sharp contrast to experts. He compared coronavirus to ""the regular flu:::"" not realizing they are quite different.

On March 7th Trump said that anyone who wants a test for Covid-19 could get one. Many Americans including doctors and patients have proven this was definitely not the case.

On March 10th he told reporters on Capitol Hill that Coronavirus ‚Äúwill go away‚Äù::: not implying months or years from now.

Also on March 10th he said::: ""No::: I think the U.S. has done a very good job on testing. We had to change things that were done::: that were nobody's fault. Perhaps they wanted to do something a different way::: but it was a much slower process from a previous administration.
And we did change them. We made the changes. But the testing has gone very well. And when people need a test::: they can get a test.‚Äù (was still a proven lie).

On March 15th::: 2020 apparently he hadn‚Äôt learned by his previous misinformation and that day Trump again contradicted Anthony Fauci's and local health officials‚Äô warnings throughout the U.S.::: at a White House briefing claiming:

‚ÄúIt's a very contagious virus::: it's incredible::: but it's something we have tremendous control of.‚Äù

In recently disclosed videos to Bob Woodward Trump is shown admitting back in February that this was actually a serious threat and much more dangerous than the flu but he didn‚Äôt want to panic you and me. Do you appreciate such life and death information being withheld from you by Big Brother?

Throughout October of 2020 during most of his maskless campaign rallies he proclaimed we had ‚Äúturned the corner‚Äù on the virus but within weeks the rates of the virus and hospitalization
s skyrocketed in most states & the painful lonely deaths are continuing with many hospitals close to capacity.

So I‚Äôm really confused. The GOP in the past has prided itself on holding people personally accountable for their words and actions::: and supposedly being ‚Äúpro-life‚Äù.

Fans say they love that Trump speaks his mind but these quotes are his exact words above and they have been highly inaccurate and knowingly contradictory::: thus risking thousands of American lives. How can you support him & his band of Senate & House enablers::: and look at yourself in the mirror each day?",I will come,ielend.net,"The PCR tests are fake.

""NYU remains unwavering in its support of Dreamers::: whom we cherish as part of both our NYU community and our nation as a whole. We have and will continue to advocate on their behalf to help ensure that they can have a clear path to citizenship.

I then learned that all this eventually leads to the big city and New York is a big place. So it was fun to look at what happened in ‚Äô85 and ‚Äô86::: the years of the songs. It‚Äôs like thinking about what else was going on in NY while our rappers were recording their albums.

Students and employees: Take a few minutes to upload your proof of vaccination and then get back to enjoying the long weekend! ‚òÄÔ∏èüçîüéÜ Upload here: http://spr.ly/6185ypH2L,2021-07-02 07:00:00,Hello::: I am trying to upload the vaccination card::: however the system does not confirm that the process has been successful. The first time I had no problem with the process.,Thank goodness we are not attending online courses it should be a choice not required üò°,"I hope your institution and all other institutions and any organization who forces another to take the Covid-19 shot get sued by their students or staff members for making it mandatory that they get the Covid-19 shot.

Your actions::: in forcing them to get the shot violates the constitution of the US.

Free will is an unalienable right that is protected by the Constitution of the US which you are violating by forcing another to take he Covid-19 shot.

God gave mankind Free will which is an unalienable right and that right is so precious to God that even He will not take away that right from a person.

So what makes mankind think he knows better than God what is right.

God gave every created being free will which means they have the right to follow the dictates of their heart even if we do not agree with how they choose to exercise their free will choices.

Just as we believers in the Lord have the right to follow the dictates of our heart and exercise our free will choices based on what we believe.

No one has the right to take away another persons free will choice as there is no love in forcing someone to do what you want them to do by what you believe and visa versa.

when all is said and done all are accountable to God for the deeds done in the body whether they be good or bad

And The Constitution of the United States says.

We hold these truths to be self-evident::: that all men are created equal::: that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights::: that among these are Life::: Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.

Which means no one has the right to force another to get the vaccinated. show id Cards pertaining to the covid-19 shot etc.

The only fear we have is fear itself.

And Those who would give up essential life::: Liberty::: and the pursuit of happiness to purchase temporary Safety::: and temp freedom deserve neither Liberty::: life or Safety."" Stop letting them take away your rights.",Proof of Vaccination: Upload Instructions,Whatyourname,NYU is heavily invested in Pfizer so now you know why this is being pushed so heavily by them. Follow the money people. It was never about your health it‚Äôs about making money off of large Pharma.,"Big Pharma has gotten to be too big::: and this is the latest proof of it. We've seen reputable doctors and researchers banned from social media for following the scientific method in scrutinizing these vaccines. And these aren't homeopathic vaccines which give you a dead version of the virus so your body can adapt to it::: they're mRNA vaccines which modify your cells to produce the same thing as COVID. That's not only a bad idea::: it's also not called a vaccine. 'Mutagen' is the correct term to use.

Here's another example of how BIg Pharma is out of control: right now we're being pushed to believe Medicare for All is the best plan for everyone and we're being reassured that it will cost less than the current cost of our healthcare system. The doctors whose studies have been cited to make this claim are coming out saying their findings were misrepresented by Bernie::: AOC::: and others in order to gain support for Medicare for All. Does anyone really believe that once Medicare for All is passed::: Big Pharma isn't just going to get the politicians they control to vote to give them higher prices for their drugs? And any politician who refuses will be portrayed by the mainstream media as being heartless and letting his constituents die from their illness.

Here's another example: right now we're being told that transgendered people are born that way and anyone who questions why these phenomenon does not occur in other animals is shamed as being a bigot. We know that females cannot produce a male child on their own. Even if asexual reproduction were possible::: their children would all be female::: as they have no Y chromosome to create a boy. How is it possible::: then::: for a woman to be born in the wrong body and actually be male::: if she has no copy of the genetic material necessary to create a male? For that matter::: is it rational to believe that a child who isn't able to consent to sex or smoke cigarettes somehow has the capacity to know they're the wrong sex?

A consequence of gender reassignment is that it requires lifelong treatment on hormones and puberty blockers. This just happens to benefit Big Pharma tremendously::: and this is being pushed on us as though it's somehow the next step of the movement Martin Luther King started. If Martin Luther King could see this::: he'd turn in his grave.

The next step for Big Pharma is to get as many kids on transgender hormones as possible and then pass Medicare for All so it can get the politicians it controls to vote for higher prices for hormones that more and more members of the public have to take for the rest of their lives::: and anyone who opposes will be called a transphobic bigot.

Americans need to take down Big Pharma::: just as we need to take down the Military Industrial Complex. Oligarchy has gotten out of control and we need to retake our country and introduce new Constitutional amendments to ensure this never happens again.","https://

"Feeling #VioletPride for #NYU2021's John Gargano::: Jr.::: this year's NYU School of Professional Studies undergraduate convocation student speaker who received clemency from former President Barack Obama in 2016. Read more about John's story:

Barack Obama
June 28 at 2:43 PM ¬∑

As President I had the chance to review requests for clemency from people who were incarcerated. It was a task I never took lightly::: since I knew my decision could change the course of someone‚Äôs life.

That was certainly true for John Gargano::: Jr. I granted John clemency in 2016::: and just last month::: he graduated from New York University with an impressive 3.9 GPA and a Bachelor of Science in Leadership and Management Studies.

John grew up on a small vegetable farm in New Jersey. He later moved to Philadelphia after high school and began working various jobs to make ends meet. While there::: he started using and selling drugs and was ultimately arrested and sentenced to 30 years in prison::: despite being a non-violent first-time offender. For the first three years he was incarcerated::: John didn‚Äôt want to talk to anyone. But he eventually vowed that he ‚Äúwould refuse to allow his sentence to break him‚Äù and turned to education to ""inspire and restore his hope for the future."" He started taking classes through the Ohio University College Program for the Incarcerated::: and helped others prepare for their GED.

After John was granted clemency::: the transition out of the criminal justice system wasn‚Äôt easy. But he credits family and programs like the Coming Home Project at St. Luke‚Äôs Mt. Sinai Hospital in Manhattan::: the Three Strikes Project at Stanford University::: and the Colleges Initiative at John Jay College for helping him make it through. In 2017::: John enrolled at Hostos Community College and graduated with a 4.0 GPA and an Associate's degree in Business Management. In 2019::: he transferred to NYU on a scholarship where he continued to excel in his studies::: participating in their Leadership Fellows program and working as a manager at a restaurant. He also worked to help others who were incarcerated find jobs or pursue higher education.

Last month::: John was selected by his classmates to serve as NYU‚Äôs undergraduate student convocation speaker. Today::: he works as a general manager at one of Chef Tom Colicchio‚Äôs restaurants in New York City and is an advocate for prison reform. John's life is a testament to the power of a second chance‚Äîand I could not be prouder of him.",2021-06-28 20:57:37,Bravo John and NYU from a proud grad and 35 year employee. Thx President Obama,Great story of human triumph against the odds.,Best story ever! Congrats::: John!üôåü•≥,Love this - thanks for sharing.

"The uprising that began at the Stonewall Inn::: just blocks away from NYU's Washington Square campus::: in the early hours of June 28::: 1969::: became a turning point in the modern LGBTQ+ movement that is now commemorated in annual Pride marches in the Village and around the world.

The first photo (Courtesy::: of the Municipal Archives::: City of New York) was taken in 1962 to update the ‚Äúproperty card‚Äù for the Village Voice building at the corner of 7th Avenue and Christopher Street::: which then sported a sign advertising the Stonewall Inn. The sign is long gone::: but this stretch of Christopher Street has been re-named Stonewall Place::: and the adjacent park is now a national monument.

NEW: NYU::: like a number of major research universities::: has decided to require all faculty (tenured::: tenure-track::: full-time contract::: and adjunct) and employees working at its US campuses and locations to be fully vaccinated with an FDA-approved or WHO-listed vaccine::: and to upload proof of vaccination by August 1::: 2021. (As previously announced::: students are also required to be vaccinated and to upload proof by July 19::: 2021.) We will have in place an exemption process for those with qualifying medical conditions or religious beliefs::: and we will also make provisions for an excused absence for those who feel unwell the day after being vaccinated. Details: http://spr.ly/6187y3U1L,2021-06-15 20:45:01,"""We will have in place an exemption process for those with religious beliefs"" effectively undoes every other word in this post.

Might as well say it's not required instead of saying ""It's required except for those who don't wanna""",I was about to say this is a lawsuit waiting to happen::: but I see there are exceptions on religious grounds::: but what about other non-religious and non medical conscientious objectors ? this will probably still end up in court. Now following other lawsuits like the one in Houston::: Methodist Hospital::: this is certainly going to end up in the Supreme Court.,Well done. This was a black eye for NYU for far too long. Have to give kudos to the right decision. Never::: have your students be required to do something you‚Äôre not willing to do yourself.,This should be a choice not a requirement.

"NYU Tisch School of the Arts students::: faculty::: and alumni have created ""The Haunting:::"" an immersive public art installation to be unveiled May 29 at Astor Place Plaza::: commemorating the first anniversary of George Floyd‚Äôs death on May 25.

The Haunting installation features iconography associated with Day of the Dead (D√≠a de los Muertos) and weaves in familiar references for death and mourning from different cultures. The immersive event::: which is free and open to the public from 6:30 to 7:30 p.m. on May 29::: is designed for audience members to move independently through space and interact with performers::: while being immersed in sound and other media. At sunset::: the installation will transform into a candlelight vigil.

‚ÄúRituals are necessary to help remind us where we've been and where we want to go. Many cultures use rituals to keep their struggles::: faith::: and traditions alive and to help them remember. This needs to be our ritual::: every year on May 25::: so we can continue to push for social justice and reform:::‚Äù said James Richards::: co-director of The Haunting and Projection Supervisor at NYU Tisch.

What is happening today in Sheikh Jarrah is the removal of the Palestinian indigenous people who live in this neighborhood::: turning it into a Zionist settlement::: and the demolishment of Palestinian heritage and culture in this neighborhood.

It is a real catastrophe that the Palestinian people are faced to be displaced and ethnically cleansed by the illegal Israeli forces.

#FreePalestine","Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood is located on the eastern side of the Old City in occupied Jerusalem. The neighborhood was established in 1956 according to an agreement signed between UNRWA and the Jordanian government.

What is happening today in Sheikh Jarrah is the removal of the Palestinian indigenous people who live in this neighborhood::: turning it into a Zionist settlement::: and the demolishment of Palestinian heritage and culture in this neighborhood.

It is a real catastrophe that the Palestinian people are faced to be displaced and ethnically cleansed by the illegal Israeli forces.

Economic sanctions are the solution::: United States should take this decision to support human rights::: the same way it did against other countries.
Israel must follow human rights declaration.","Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood is located on the eastern side of the Old City in occupied Jerusalem. The neighborhood was established in 1956 according to an agreement signed between UNRWA and the Jordanian government.

What is happening today in Sheikh Jarrah is the removal of the Palestinian indigenous people who live in this neighborhood::: turning it into a Zionist settlement::: and the demolishment of Palestinian heritage and culture in this neighborhood.

It is a real catastrophe that the Palestinian people are faced to be displaced and ethnically cleansed by the illegal Israeli forces.

FROM World wide opinion::: ASAP for Under 12 years old are provided Covid vaccine ::: we pray !,"Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood is located on the eastern side of the Old City in occupied Jerusalem. The neighborhood was established in 1956 according to an agreement signed between UNRWA and the Jordanian government.

What is happening today in Sheikh Jarrah is the removal of the Palestinian indigenous people who live in this neighborhood::: turning it into a Zionist settlement::: and the demolishment of Palestinian heritage and culture in this neighborhood.

It is a real catastrophe that the Palestinian people are faced to be displaced and ethnically cleansed by the illegal Israeli forces.

"NEW: All members of the NYU community‚Äîstudents and employees‚Äîwho get vaccinated at NYU Langone Health or off campus are now required to upload their vaccine card to the Student Health Center Portal. If you were vaccinated through the Student Health Center‚Äôs on-campus program::: your record of vaccination is automatically uploaded.

The science tells us that vaccination is central to our goals of keeping each other safe while easing campus restrictions and returning to in-person activities. Uploading your proof of vaccination is important and doesn‚Äôt take long::: so please do it promptly after receiving the final dose of any FDA authorized or World Health Organization (WHO) listed vaccines. FAQ and instructions: http://spr.ly/6186HhSmr",2021-05-07 14:21:52,What you did suppressing actual intellectual thought from Mark Crispin Miller's class just shows that you are afraid::: compromised and anything you teach now is only for compliance. You are part of the problem and should be ashamed. As far as I'm concerned and any rational person who values free speech and thought::: this university is a farce.,Since the science says what it says the NYU staff will be required to take the vaccine correct?,And once it is uploaded::: you are no longer required to wear a mask,"NYU invited ex/president Alvaro Uribe to speak::: even though more than a thousand students and faculty members signed a letter asking the university to rescind the invitation. It's not cancel culture::: it's about not celebrating a man responsible for vast human rights violations. https://

"""To become a nurse::: you don‚Äôt just learn human anatomy.

ictator",How can an institution dedicated to knowledge be so tone deaf as to invite √Ålvaro Uribe to speak publicly after he comanded the military forces that committed at least 6.400 verified civilian murders? Especially as Colombia currently bleeds under the riots that are happening as a result of his successor's horrific work? #CancelUribe #soscolombia,"My name is Diana Carvajal and I am a professor at Universidad Externado de Colombia. I am astonished at the initiative of this center to promote the talk of former president Alvaro Uribe. The very title ""Sustainable Colombia: Politics::: Planet and Democratic Security: A conversation with the president"" is a total incongruity and lack of empathy with the current situation in the country.
It bothers me as a citizen and researcher that within this academic exercise you are not considering the before mentioned sensitive issue as well as other voices since there are no other Colombian academics as panelists on this discussion. On the other hand::: you do not take into account information on the damage caused by the government of Alvaro Uribe and the current government of Ivan Duque to human rights and the peace agreements.

I hope in the future your center will discuss Colombian problems with greater and well-informed criteria and out of respect for current conditions::: I think you must cancel this talk.",He is no longer president of Colombia for many years! #UribeDioLaOrden #UribeAsesino #soscolombia,"Dear New York University and NYU Brademas Center::: is outrageous that you are inviting ex-president Alvaro Uribe to hold a conversation about sustainability and democracy.

NYU Office of Global Inclusion::: Diversity::: and Strategic Innovation
April 26 at 3:42 PM ¬∑

This has been an incredibly trying and painful year for our New York University communities‚Äîamidst the COVID-19 pandemic and the surge of racism and racist violence that continue to plague the United States and our global community::: we have also experienced arguably the largest::: most global::: and most transgenerational movement for racial justice in history. We have come together to innovate during disruption which has brought forth new challenges along with new opportunities.

During these unprecedented times::: NYU Office of Global Inclusion::: Diversity::: and Strategic Innovation has worked across NYU this academic year to double down on efforts to advance diversity::: equity::: inclusion::: and access. As we do each year::: we are organizing an open space for all NYU community members::: during which Dr. Lisa Coleman::: SVP for Global Inclusion and Strategic Innovation::: will reflect back and charge us to accelerate forward as we create a more inclusive NYU together.

"Happy 190th birthday to us! NYU was founded on this day in 1831::: and this Founders Memorial on Schwartz Plaza (just east of Bobst Library) features the only surviving architectural detail from the very first building the University built on Washington Square. It's had quite a journey over the years.  The University Building‚Äîwhich sat on the east side of Washington Square::: where the Silver Center for Arts and Science is now‚Äîwas largely completed by 1835 and dedicated in 1837. Its iconic architectural style was Gothic Revival.  In 1894::: NYU moved the bulk of undergraduate instruction from Greenwich Village to the new University Heights campus in the Bronx. In the same year::: the University tore down the University Building::: preserving this spire‚Äîcomplete with a few ""grotesques""‚Äîto install at University Heights in memory of our first home. When NYU sold the Heights campus in 1973::: the Founders Memorial was returned to Washington Square.",2021-04-18 10:58:53,I wish you a big and memorable birthday that will tell you how important you are to us and that with each passing year you become wiser::: cooler and better.

This past year has been marked by not one but two pandemics: COVID-19 and the plague of systemic racism. They may seem unconnected::: but racial bias is why Black communities are among those most vulnerable to the virus. Civil rights and racial justice scholar Deborah Archer is acutely familiar with the inequitable practices that degrade Black lives. The NYU School of Law professor and ACLU president studies systemic racism in the criminal legal system. Archer‚Äôs recent research focuses on how crime-free housing ordinances‚Äîlaws that encourage or require private landlords to exclude or evict tenants who have had encounters with the criminal legal system‚Äîenable discrimination.

New York University added a new photo. April 12::: 2021 at 5:32 AM ¬∑ More options  Heard at NYU: Issa Rae::: co-creator and star of HBO's Insecure::: spoke at the Fusion Film Festival::: where she was named 2021 Woman of the Year. ü§©,2021-04-12 13:32:35,Ms. Issa Ray::: ma'am did you know that NYU puts out racists students? I'm not referring to expelling them but educating them and sending them out into the world to spread their filth and sickness. Ms. Julia H. Goldring (Beres) is a known one.,Is that House Box Office HBO?,It was like a dream when my husband and l were together for 4 years & it was 1 year since we separated. I still love him::: but somehow I feel it‚Äôs unfair why love someone who obviously doesn‚Äôt love you back? I‚Äôve prayed & prayed for all these year & nothing::: He is still with his new girlfriend (whom he lives with). But it doesn‚Äôt mean I have to look for help. The first week after the breakup::: I was on my knees praying to get help::: I used to SMS him but no response calling him he never picked my calls and finally blocked all my numbers not even to support the kids. I really missed him so much::: I have tried all other means to get him back but couldn't::: then I found a blogpost online however about a spiritual mama helping to restore relationships::: get ex-lover back and many others. ‚Äù So I decided to give a try cause I love my husband so much. So I contacted Mama adamz on +256785800158::: I told her all my problems and she gave me a guarantee that I will have my husband back after the spell prayer. So I was gifted and lucky to have contacted her. I did everything she asked me to do::: and to my greatest surprise a day after the prayer my husband called me and apologized for what he did to me. He asked for my forgiveness to come back home for me. I got really hurt & went through those moments whereby he left me. After all::: Mama did for me::: I forgave him and he came back home with more love and happiness. All thanks to the gods and Mama adamz the real spiritual Healer so far google recommended this year. So please if you need any help contact her too on this. You see in conclusion you have to just trust the process::: Mama adamz is a good real Spiritual Healer and by giving this testimony is the only way I could pay or thank her... so you can also call/Whatsapp Mama adamz on +256785800158 for a spell prayer incase of any life challenges.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was less than a century ago that Americans confronted the epidemic peak of polio::: a viral disease that attacks the central nervous system. But the country was very different then. ‚ÄúThere was no vaccine resistance‚Äîthe notion of not taking a vaccine because one in a million kids could be hurt by it was ridiculous:::‚Äù says NYU Langone Health's David Oshinsky::: the author of the Pulitzer Prize‚Äìwinning Polio: An American Story. ‚ÄúThere was no belief that the medical community was out to poison or make money off people. There were no TV networks saying the disease was being overhyped by one political party for political gain.‚Äù  In a way::: Oshinsky says::: vaccines are a victim of their own success::: having done their job so well with conditions such as polio that the evidence of what they take care of is gone::: erasing memories of what life was like before them. For that reason::: among others::: it‚Äôs fitting to remember how America successfully‚Äîand collectively‚Äîconquered polio. ‚ÄúIt was all hands on deck:::‚Äù Oshinsky says. ‚ÄúPeople saw what polio was and they were all in it together to make certain that a safe vaccine was produced.‚Äù  Read more in the latest issue of Scope::: NYU's research magazine: http://spr.ly/6186HQWEM,2021-03-27 13:33:04,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"""The deaths of these eight victims‚Äîsix of whom were Asian::: including five women‚Äîstand out not only for their senselessness and violence::: but also for the backdrop against which they occurred: an appalling increase in hateful attacks across the country directed at those in the Asian community:::"" wrote President Hamilton today in a statement about yesterday's brutal killings in Georgia.  ""We at NYU stand together with the Asian community in mourning the murdered::: in repudiating and opposing those who fan the fires of hate and stoke them with violent acts::: and in letting the members of this community at NYU know that they are welcome here::: that they are supported::: that they belong here::: and that as an institution we remain committed to their safety and well-being.  ""In this tragic moment::: I want to remind everyone that we will continue to take action to address specific issues here at NYU."" More:  NYU.EDU Statement from NYU President Andrew Hamilton on Killings in Georgia",2021-03-17 18:59:38,1. There are 2 genders::: not 2 dozen. 2. New York University is NOT on stolen land. 3. There is no increase in attacks on Asians. This is a media-created perception. Nobody hates Asians. Saying otherwise is a lie. 4. The attacks in Georgia were motivated by mental illness and sexual addiction::: not racism. 5. ALL murder is evil. The ethnicity of the victims does not make a murder more horrible OR less horrible.,We mourn the violence against and death of working Asian women and the anti-Asian hatred in all its manifestations.  But::: be aware that NYU is collaborating with the US government on its racist China Initiative::: by terminating the tenure and employment of Chinese/ Chinese-American scientists or other scientists of color who have lab sharing with Chinese scientists. NYU does this under the cover of federal racial profiling that assumes that such scientists in the US are engaging in espionage for the PRC. Andy Hamilton has facilitated the US racist China Initiative at NYU. His crocodile tears about anti-Asian racism and hatred must be taken with a large grain of salt.,This is a very sad sad day on the 8 lives that have been lost. I am so glad that NYU has recognized this as a tragedy. Once more::: we also must pay homage to the lives and loved ones lost in the United States from COVID-19.

March 19th and April 19th are extra days off for NYU employees this year. Our hope is that everyone will enjoy the time to rest and recharge‚Äîrather than being tempted to use it catch up on work! Some ideas: https://bit.ly/2P5hIFn  NYU Work Life March 15::: 2021 at 11:30 AM ¬∑  Many of us have found the separation between our work and home lives blurred over the last year - which is why we are encouraging the NYU community to Take the Day on March 19 and April 19!

It is our daughters senior year so she has effectively lost 3 semesters (and 2 spring breaks) to the ‚Äúpandemic‚Äù. Surely you know that most kids don‚Äôt have Friday classes anyways so these days ‚Äúoff‚Äù are a joke. But still::: graduation is virtual and no adjustment in grad dates as if they had a week long spring breaks and this semester was normal. If you cared at all about the mental state of your community::: you‚Äôd have made real adjustments to the schedule to make sure the students had a real break from the virtual learning that no one really signed on to do for 15 mos running but had golden handcuffs to commit to if they wanted to graduate from the university with whom they had made a bigger commitment to than they had to them...,Martha Huertas,ÿ¥ÿßÿπÿ±Ÿá ÿßŸÑÿßÿ≥ÿßÿ∑Ÿäÿ±,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here's the latest from NYU leadership on the health of the NYU community (including an uptick in positive cases and the need to stick with our safety rules)::: our plans for summer and fall::: the virtual 2021 Commencement::: and two days off this spring:  NYU.EDU Summary Update on COVID-19-related Developments,2021-02-26 14:28:37,Some doctor's instructions for women 1- It is not necessary to do all the household chores in one day. Women who do such things live in stress and are resting under many such graves. 2 - Take some time to relax::: because it is not a sin to rest for a while and eat something you like. 3- If there is severe headache::: So to get rid of this pain::: you must rest for a while::: if possible::: take a nap for a while. Because women who do not take care of their comfort have to be ready to say goodbye to their families ahead of time for a journey from which there is no way back. 4- Do not work while drowsy. Because it is very harmful to your mental health and other organs. And it can affect your memory and make you suffer from Alzheimer's disease. So keep your mind calm::: take time for walks and have fun and laugh heartily. There will be no more work. 5- For your peace of mind::: take time to do light exercise and relax yourself::: such as yoga. Take deep breaths in the open and fresh air and then exhale and get rid of the negative thoughts inside you. 6- Praise yourself by standing in front of the mirror::: It will charge positive waves in and around you::: creating a glow of self-confidence . 7- Arrange the invitation for yourself::: it is not necessary that your husband will take you to the invitation::: if he does not have time::: do it for yourself. You can also go alone::: because you are entitled to it. Are 8- Be sure to seek the help of modern machinery and technology to facilitate your daily routine::: because mental burden is the silent killer of women. 9- If you are not feeling better::: make sure to contact a doctor::: if possible::: go to your nearest hospital::: otherwise contact by phone::: but do not take any medicine by yourself. Using medication without a doctor's advice can be harmful to you. 10- Check your sugar level and blood pressure from time to time. It is not necessary to check only when a person is sick::: even if they are not sick::: precaution can be taken and by doing so many women can avoid getting sick. Believe me::: I am giving you the right advice Value yourself Learn to love yourself and take care of yourself::: because you deserve to be appreciated. And never forget that you are a beautiful masterpiece of God.

There is a lot of existing neuroscience research concerned with whether or not the brain exerts additional cognitive effort when switching between languages.

NYTIMES.COM How a Fintech Exec Who Focuses on Poverty Relief Spends Sundays,2021-02-08 21:55:52,Some important technical things related to finding missing climbers: I have been studying Himalayan mountaineering for 4 years as a junior climb student. The structure of mountains::: climate change::: climbing routes::: challenge level::: successful and unsuccessful missions::: and detailed research and review of mountaincy accidents have also been part of my study journey. During this time::: I have been presenting many research articles with simple understanding and writing in national language so that people who love mountains can have better access to information. So in the light of my limited but important information::: there are a few requests regarding the recent accident on k2... Remember that of the k2's climbing routes::: the most adopted route is the abruzzi spur or abruzzi ridge by climbers around the world. For the moment::: more than 75% of the missions were done on the same route. K2 has also been done on abruzzi route. Apart from this route::: another important route is called cesan route or Basque route. It's actually south-south-spu r. Which is located on the abruzzi route camp 4::: near the sholder section::: the death zone::: which is 8:::000 meters high and meets it::: and both routes become one. In the picture under consideration the line e shows the same cesan route while the abruzzi route is marked with line f. The problem with cheeses rot is that it consists of all the rock n ice area::: which is the most technical and difficult challenge in terms of climbing.

So he didn't go either.....,Long post alert: Frustrated graduating senior parent here. Yes::: I know there is a virus. I am an anesthetist and personally care for up to 20 patients a day::: every day::: even with a virus. That being said::: cancelling graduation again seems a bit lackluster in the creative department for such a innovative::: thought provoking::: top tier university especially in light of the fact the the NY Yankees will be playing a game in that same stadium a few days later ...with spectators.  Perhaps the individual schools within the university can hold their graduations there with appropriate distancing?  -Yankee stadium holds 50:::287 fans. -The total number of NYU undergraduate students is: 26:::981. -Divided by 4 (rough estimate) the graduating class should be approximately: 6:::745 students.  -If the students went to Yankee stadium alone (no guests)::: they could have 7 seats between each student! (It could be broadcast for families to see. That seems entirely possible for the number 2 film school in the nation - right?)  -If they each graduate brought 2 guests::: that increases the number of needed seats to 13:::490...divide d into the 50:::287::: allows 3 seats between each group of 3.  Come on NYU::: for a $250:::000.00+ education::: you can try harder and do better. Seriously.,Very disappointed with last years. The could honor each student since it is their accomplishment and not listen to speakers and showing buildings in the city. Very poorly done.,Its so sad ... the graduation for NYU is always one that students and parents look forward to. However::: not willing to take a chance on my child's health. Health and Safety is always my priority for the kids. Lets support their decision.,So im in the nursing school and most of us students in the program have gotten the vaccine already. Can our program have in person if said people have gotten the vaccine?,Agree with everyone who thinks there can be an outdoor stadium graduation. Absolutely should be considered.,Class of 2017 here. The Super Bowl can be held and the Yankees have a game two days after the commencement date with spectators attendingü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è But you can‚Äôt give these grads a proper commencement?,hate this situation. I have a son who graduated college last year and the same thing will be happened for my second one this year.,I agree::: it's not realistic to expect most families to be able to travel::: quarantine::: find suitable accommodations::: etc. But what about a hybrid graduation where the graduates and faculty attend in person and the guests join virtually? Obviously::: this would not be great but maybe better than completely virtual.,How are the Yankees able to play with limited fans in attendance but students can be celebrated?,Hopefully they will reconsider this decision. Surely they.will be able to figure out a workable solution. There MUST be a way.,Has anyone reached out to NYU directly with these questions and If so what is there response? I doubt they check back on FB to read comments.,New York University CUOMO just announced 10% capacity limits on Arenas and Stadiums as of 2/23/21 perhaps this will be a number you can work with and allow an in person graduation for the NYU Class of 2021 along with the class of 2020!!??

I was exercising my free speech and retweeting the Hunter Biden story when twitter banned me in October. I had 1400 followers including Lin Wood. A common complaint among conservatives on twitter is being suspended or banned. Don't lie. Conservatives are being silenced.

The left gets a warning::: they get to apologize::: remove their post and all is fine for their ""honest mistakes"" I continuously ask what part of my post is in violation because there isn't any they don't tell you because that allows them to continue to ban you::: then when you get so many bans they ban you permanently. I am on my 4th account. I got a permanent ban for saying silly Hilly (Hillary)::: for calling someone a liberal snowflake::: for asking how it's Russia's fault that crackhead Hunter forgot he had a laptop in the shop. I get called a NAZI DYKE & that violates no ""community standards"" I got banned for saying I know my vote didn't count because 2 days before Pa gave Biden our electoral votes the judge from our polling place said they couldn't even call our county because they ""lost"" 47 flash drives.",Caught the Censorship Study you supported on Tucker Carlson. Can't believe people spend or maybe it's thier Parents spending money just to get rid of their Morons for a few Semesters.

Being a part of a community means taking responsibility for one another's well-being. And the daily actions our students::: faculty::: and staff have been taking all school year‚Äîmasking up::: being tested regularly::: avoiding gatherings‚Äîare a powerful demonstration of how committed NYUers are to that promise. Now we're looking ahead to a new semester::: a new start::: and another chance to keep working together toward a more hopeful tomorrow. üíú,2021-01-22 15:04:39,NYU is made of of good people - not just steel and concrete buildings. All communities should be centered around academia::: hospitals::: and public service rather than around weapons or Wall St. Study with friendship and fun rather than excess stress and competition - this is more productive for both the individual student and also for the schools/ colleges.

‚ÄúI was supposed to be doing an internship this semester. Actually::: it was supposed to run from last spring through the fall::: but it was canceled because of COVID. It goes without saying that I was pretty upset about it::: but surprisingly::: another opportunity opened up for me. I‚Äôve had the chance to get involved with a research project called DETER. It‚Äôs run through the Center for Urban Science and Progress and we use vector tracing and 3-D models to track the spread of COVID through urban environments. We‚Äôre focused mostly on New York City because that‚Äôs where we are. It‚Äôs been a really cool thing that popped up that I wasn‚Äôt expecting::: and that wouldn‚Äôt have been there at any other time. I do feel like Manhattan has changed a lot since the pandemic started. Stores close earlier. The streets are a bit emptier. But I‚Äôve also found that the spots in the city that would usually be filled with people are filled with people in a different way. I walked through Times Square the other week and saw at least 30 groups of people filming TikToks on their phones. It‚Äôs like a whole new culture is emerging and people are finding new things to do. They‚Äôre getting outside more and exploring while they have the space and time to do it. Personally::: I‚Äôve been inclined to try new places to eat::: especially when I‚Äôm at Tandon in Brooklyn. I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm a food connoisseur::: but I do like discovering new foods. I‚Äôll walk around and find new restaurants::: see different areas and different people. The atmosphere changes from block to block. It‚Äôll be sad if the spring semester ends the same way last year did. I‚Äôm really hoping for the whole purple lights::: Yankee Stadium graduation. If that‚Äôs not where it‚Äôs headed::: it‚Äôll be disheartening. I think a lot of seniors coming into this year thought and hoped it would be different.‚Äù  ‚ÄîChristian Hamilton (NYU College of Arts and Science '22) Hometown: Bronx::: New York,2021-01-21 14:23:35,Can anyone ex student or existing student help me in getting admission in new york University,Hashama Khan,Hello ::: Can you do Data Entry if you are trained ?The pay is $100 per hour. and you can work 35 hours a week are you okay with that?

After many attempts to change my mind::: and following reports by IMs (unofficial informers for the Stasi::: the State Security) that I was planning to defect::: I was thrown in prison four months later. Going on hunger strike a number of times and filing complaints during my time on remand had little effect. Torgau hard labour prison had several Stasi liaison officers on site and many of the inmates were Stasi informers. I consistently refused prison rules::: forced labour and political education (phrase-mongeri ng). I also refused to take part in prison yard military drill. In this way I hoped I might be regarded as ‚Äòintolerable‚Äô and so be deported to the West. Of my four years in prison::: I spent a total of 14 months in strictest solitary detention::: where smoking::: writing and reading was prohibited and mail from home was withheld. At night I had to sleep on a wooden board without a mattress. Lunch was provided once every three days only::: otherwise just two slices of dry bread mornings and evenings. During interrogation I was routinely insulted and referred to as an antisocial pig::: rat::: scum::: parasite::: enemy of the GDR::: criminal::: louse etc. They threatened that I‚Äôd never reach pension age and so would never be allowed to leave for the West. All I wanted was to be free::: but the GDR wouldn‚Äôt let me go. Their laws were inhumane; any kind of resistance or opposition was punished with long prison sentences. Back then I didn‚Äôt yet know that I‚Äôd be imprisoned for a total of four years. If you have ever spent time in a dark::: cold cellar you‚Äôll be able to imagine how horrible it was to be down there for weeks and months at a time. Those in positions of authority during the GDR dictatorship were almost never prosecuted and are today living the good life on undeservedly high pensions::: paid for by the taxpayer. Many perpetrators are still to be found in ‚ÄòDie Linke‚Äô (‚ÄòThe Left‚Äô) political party or even serving in the police or in public office in the eastern part of Germany. They stir up hatred against their victims and try to convince themselves that their conscience is clear.  We::: the former political prisoners and victims of Stasi terror::: are slowly dying out.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs definitely been a lot of adjusting going on. All of my lectures are online::: but I do have clinical work every other week and a weekly simulation for another class. For clinical::: I go to NYU Langone Health Orthopedic Hospital. I‚Äôve been lucky not to have any close calls with COVID::: and I think a big part of that is how diligent NYU has been about its own testing program. Clinicals have been smooth overall::: other than having to wear a face shield. It‚Äôs a pain because it fogs up and gets in the way of my stethoscope::: which is really just inconvenient. The simulations have been cut from three hours to an hour and a half::: split between two groups so there aren‚Äôt as many people in a room at one time. I totally understand the reason for it::: but I feel like sometimes I don‚Äôt have enough time to practice the skills I‚Äôm learning. But when that happens I can register for open simulation times to go back in and get more practice. If coronavirus wasn‚Äôt a thing::: I probably wouldn‚Äôt have to put in that extra time::: but I‚Äôm grateful to have the option when I need it. I‚Äôve always been organized::: and it can get pretty hectic trying to keep everything straight::: but if I ever feel like I‚Äôm falling behind::: I reach out to my nursing group to get back on track. I‚Äôm not the best virtual learner. Sometimes it‚Äôs hard for me to feel engaged in lectures. But professors post lecture recordings after class::: so if I ever feel like I missed something important I can watch them and really focus on those parts that I missed or am feeling most nervous about. And since I don‚Äôt have to travel to and from class::: I‚Äôve had time to finally get involved in other things I‚Äôve had my eye on. I joined Nursing Students for Global Health and am currently the vice president.‚Äù  ‚ÄîPaloma Franco (NYU Rory Meyers College of Nursing '22) Hometown: Davis::: California,2021-01-14 14:30:37,Good job! this virtual learning of a thing I guess it's pretty well good but for some slow learner's it will be uneasy for them well since you said lectures post the learning of the day video It's obviously much better so you people can get a chance to re watch the videos so as to gain better understanding .

‚ÄúWe found that marijuana use is consistently higher among those surveyed later in the year::: peaking during late fall or early winter before dropping at the beginning of the following year.

Vaccinations against COVID-19 ‚Äî which have been proven to be safe and effective ‚Äî have begun::: including in our own community. At this point::: New York State authorities are permitting vaccination of the people who fall into Category 1A and::: as of January 11::: those who fall into Category 1B. Last week::: NYU Langone Health began making appointments available to members of the NYU community in category 1A. This week::: we will begin extending appointments to individuals that fall into Category 1B::: including individuals aged 75 or older and those teaching in-person classes in the spring semester. The University has already started emailing some of those in the NYU community who fall into Categories 1A and 1B to make them aware that they are eligible. Going forward::: that will be our pattern: as the State directs that new categories are eligible for vaccination::: we will send communications to those members of the NYU community who fall into those categories. We understand that many members of the NYU community are eager to be vaccinated ASAP; we‚Äôd like that::: too. Nevertheless::: we would ask that you not call the NYU COVID Prevention & Response Team to attempt to determine if you are eligible at any given point. When you are eligible::: we will email you as promptly as possible.  Details on vaccination locations and more:  NYU.EDU An Update on Vaccinations::: Availability::: and the NYU Community,2021-01-12 01:36:11,Does anyone know if you are fully vaccinated and wait the appropriate amount of time after the second dose::: if New York State will be requiring quarantine upon entry?,"If there is a marriageable girl in the heart of a Muslim religious family?

During the Fall 2020 semester::: students in the NYU Gallatin School of Individualized Study course ‚ÄúNYC Coastlines::: Past: Present::: and Future‚Äù became the only citizen scientists to collect oyster monitoring data from the Hudson River for The River Project‚Äôs entire 2020 season::: which suffered from a lack of volunteers due to the pandemic.  The course::: which is open to all Gallatin students who need to fulfill a science requirement‚Äîwhether or not they think they‚Äôre ‚Äúgood‚Äù at the subject::: says professor of environmental science Karen Holmberg‚Äînormally includes several field trips to allow students to examine New York City waterways and study the impact of urbanism on the natural environment. But this time::: COVID-19 safety restrictions led Holmberg to ‚Äúpull apart the syllabus at the seams and rebuild it:::‚Äù scrapping visits to the Coney Island MTA yard::: the Cornell oyster hatchery::: and the NYC Archaeological Repository in favor of an enhanced outdoor experience with The River Project::: among other real-world opportunities for data collection.  The River Project::: part of the Hudson River Trust::: has previously welcomed Holmberg‚Äôs classes to tour its lab::: but this time invited the students to take part in actual oyster monitoring over the course of several weeks instead. The oysters::: which are on wire meshes attached to pier pilings::: are tagged with a number and all living oysters were measured and weighed. The health of the oysters are examined each month to determine the health of the Hudson River.  ‚ÄúStudents enjoyed getting muddy and understanding the monitoring process by collecting data about the mortality and growth of the oysters:::‚Äù Holmberg says. ‚ÄúAn artist in our group took silt from the oysters and created a drawing of an oyster. We were outside and still masked and distanced but it was a different level of freedom. The students did such a great job with the data collection that they were invited back for the following month.‚Äù  In addition to oyster monitoring::: students also visited Red Hook in Brooklyn to collect data for The Citizens‚Äô Water Quality Testing (CWQT) project. Traveling by ferry instead of subway or car gave students a greater connection to the water they were studying‚Äîand an opportunity to sample Steve‚Äôs key lime pie::: a neighborhood favorite::: as a reward for making the trek in the cold rain.  One student reflected on the experience::: stating::: ‚ÄúI think the project exemplifies how science is all around us::: not just in a lab. While we are going to explore our findings in a scientific manner we are also engaging with the waterfront which has given me a new appreciation for the city's coastline. I also have a new appreciation for field scientists::: who have to endure harsh conditions to continue projects and discoveries.‚Äù  That‚Äôs always been Holmberg‚Äôs hope for the course‚Äîthat it will nurture in students a better understanding of how embedded in the natural world we all are::: especially in an era of climate change and sea-level rise::: all while reinforcing the idea that science starts with close observation::: which can be done everywhere and by anyone. ‚ÄúCitizen science is crucial as it broadens the data collected for scientific understanding but also gives increased understanding to the environmental issues we face:::‚Äù she says.,2021-01-08 15:05:43,I am grateful to have these photos of an exceptionally heroic/ stalwart/ sparkling cohort of students celebrated!

"""After a year of difficulties and turmoil and sorrow::: I thought::: as I am sure many of you did::: that 2021 would be different. I didn‚Äôt delude myself that all our problems would be solved ‚Äî there are too many::: and some are too large. But I allowed myself the belief that we might leave the worst behind::: usher in a period of righting the most egregious wrongs::: avoid the worst ignominies::: and begin to replace untruth with facts and divisiveness with understanding.  And then came January 6::: 2021.  In the worst desecration of American democracy perhaps any of us have known::: a violent mob ‚Äî incited by a steady diet of lies and stoked grievances::: indifferent to the will of American voters::: unconcerned about the tenets of democracy ‚Äî stormed the Capitol::: disrupted the work of Congress in duly certifying the election of a new president::: and upended the peaceful transition of power that has been a centuries-long::: cherished foundation of American political life.  It was a preposterous::: unimaginable scene::: like something from a novel picked up in an airport bookshop that we can enjoy reading because of its implausibility. This has been a heartbreaking::: damaging::: and disgraceful ordeal.  There are so many questions that will emerge from this day: how did we end up with leaders so willing to put their own personal::: political interests ahead of the nation‚Äôs welfare? How has political courage become so rare::: that elected officials are willing to let corrosive lies and mistrust stand when they have every reason to know better? How have we allowed our civic dialogue to become so debased that we are nonchalant about dangers of political extremism? How can we explain the passivity of law enforcement towards a throng that breached the Capitol and threatened Congress::: much less reconcile it with the aggression previously shown towards peaceful protesters challenging injustice and oppression::: many of whom were people of color? How resilient is our democracy::: really?  On this unnerving day::: I console myself with four thoughts. First::: that notwithstanding its January date::: I will consider this one of the final incidents of 2020 rather than one of the opening events of 2021. Second::: I hope ‚Äî indeed::: I believe ‚Äî that the Constitutional traditions and democratic institutions that drew me to American citizenship will::: along with common sense::: reassert themselves::: and that this episode will ‚Äî by casting the stakes in such sharp relief ‚Äî prove to be the death knell for this destructive brand of politics::: as the Army-McCarthy hearings were in their time. Third::: that regardless of today‚Äôs awfulness::: there will be a peaceful transition of presidential power two weeks hence. And fourth::: that I am lucky to pass the coming period of reflection and correction in the company of a community of scholars and learners committed to truth::: peace::: mutual respect::: inclusion::: and true justice.  I share your sense of unease and discouragement. In response::: I say: stay strong and steady::: and stay true to our collective values. Take courage from one another‚Äôs comradeship. In the weeks and months and years to come::: this country will need us at our best more than perhaps ever before.  Sincerely::: Andrew Hamilton""  NYU.EDU A Message from NYU President Andy Hamilton on Today's Events",2021-01-07 02:38:30,Excellent statement President Hamilton. What occurred today was disgraceful and I feel very sorry for those people who do not see it that way. Many people are not learning from history and it saddens me the amount of ignorance and hatred we have seen in this country over the past four years. I‚Äôm proud to be a member of the NYU community.,I have written and called out President Hamilton several times here on FB... Re: Rapist::: Thief::: Fraud::: Unprofessional and Unethical Faculty member... and no response! And yes I did contact him directly... he just doesn't care who is on Faculty... sad very sad!,The more the public hears from leaders with character and integrity the better. Thank you for standing up for the truth and for what is right.,How do supposedly intelligent people even hold BLM equivalent to what President Hamilton is writing about?  How?  Is the image of a deluded mass halting government process of election certification not enough of a wake up call?  A man just bore the traitorous flag of the Confederacy- the side that tried to secede & break off from the union- in the bloody US Capitol?  Folks literally broke into offices of elected leaders: where all manner of sensitive document could be in place::: spreading COVID-19 virus::: bugging the place?  I am not an American & care little about the petty politics.  I am just at loss at how divorced from reality some Americans are: COVID-19::: climate change::: baseless claims of election frauds::: and downplaying actions if done by any other demographics (black::: Muslims::: Jews etc) would have rightfully been called domestic terrorism.,Thank you to those who called out President Hamilton...very disappointed in him as an alumni.,one of those things the life is just what it is and sometimes we just have to go through the barriers to get to where we need to go and we wait for the world to change it's not going to always happen that way,President Hamilton... You have no room to talk... after all you have a Rapist::: Thief::: Unprofessional and Unethical Faculty Member and you know who she is and you allow her to remain on faculty... so stop with your BS ! And if you know where I can be found just ask her !!!!,Well said President Hamilton,Excellent message President Hamilton! Thank you.,Comparing BLM protest which is against law enforcement murdering black men and women with::: what happened in our Capital yesterday. You are just an enabler. The behavior of Trump supporters were despicable and shameful. They brought a noose to the Capital instead of wearing the Kkan outfit. If you can defend such actions you are morally bankrupt. Thank you President Hamilton for taking a stand.,Mr. Hamilton do you remember the ‚Äúhe‚Äôs not my President‚Äù protestors when Trump was elected? They almost burned down and vandalized Trump Tower in Chicago. The streets were vandalized::: violence in the streets and people dragged out of their cars and beated up by mobs. Did NYU make a statement? Mr. Hamilton were you just as horrified? I don‚Äôt agree with the property distruction or violence today::: but why are you speaking for NYU with your one sided? I am a proud NYU graduate and am offended by the constant one sided opinions. Who cares what your personal opinion is Mr. Hamilton.,good job go ahead,Any thoughts on the anti-democracy crackdown in Hong Kong or is that too close to the wallet for you guys?,God Bless YOU my Dear new york University.

‚ÄúThis semester has been exhausting. I feel like my days are longer and my classes drain so much more out of me because I‚Äôm not physically there to connect with other students. Since it‚Äôs all through a screen::: it feels like it‚Äôs just me and the professor. There‚Äôs no horizontal connection happening. And I think that‚Äôs been the theme. A lot of things that students are involved in::: both extracurricular and academical::: are much more labor intensive despite being virtual. Even though I don‚Äôt have to physically go to my classes::: the hours that I spend in front of a computer screen are so lengthy that by the time I wrap up my average weekday around 7 p.m.::: I‚Äôm completely spent. One of the reasons I came to NYU in the first place was to connect with other students and broaden my network. Some professional development programs have done a good job of adapting to the virtual environment. But things like on-campus recruiting::: which is a huge part of being a Stern student::: are completely remote now. I was fortunate enough to secure a job for after graduation::: but there are many students::: especially sophomores and juniors::: who aren‚Äôt getting the same facetime with employers that they would have otherwise. Even though I have a job lined up::: it was uncertain for a long time. I didn‚Äôt know how it was going to work or how I could efficiently network with recruiters. When I was studying away at NYU Washington::: DC::: last spring::: I saw the impact COVID had on the economy. I watched the numbers fall in real time. For a business student::: or any student who‚Äôs professionally oriented::: it was completely unsettling. But we looked for ways to find hope. Stern‚Äôs alumni program coordinated a speaker series with students who graduated in 2008 and 2009. They came and spoke about their experiences with a recession market and shared their wisdom about what to do when it feels like the sky is falling.‚Äù  ‚ÄîSpencer Asch NYU Stern Undergraduate College '21 Major: Business and Political Economy Hometown: Whitehouse Station::: New Jersey,2020-12-31 14:58:51,Happy New Year Spencer.

So on one evening::: as i was coming back from work:::i met an old friend of mine who asked of my wife So i explained every thing to her:::so she told me that the only way i can get my wife back:::is to visit a spell caster :::because it has really worked for her too So i never believed in spell:::but i had no other choice:::than to follow her advice. Then she gave me the his whatsApp number +2348165234627 So the next morning:::i sent a message to the number she gave to me:::and the spell caster assured me that i will get my wife back the next two days what an amazing statement!! I never believed:::so he spoke with me:::and told me everything that i needed to do. Within 48hours::: So surprisingly::: my wife who did not call me for the past seven months:::gave me a call to inform me that she w byas coming back. So Amazing!! So that was how she came back that same day:::with lots of love,While investment can build wealth::: you'd also want to balance potential gains with the risk involved.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm still here and trying my best. That‚Äôs really all I can do. Right now::: it seems like you can either orient yourself toward the future or just try to make the best of the present. For me::: it‚Äôs orienting myself toward the future because the present situation is rough. I‚Äôm looking forward to the spring not really because anything‚Äôs going to change::: but because I‚Äôll be done with law school applications. I‚Äôve had a lot of time to focus on them this semester::: and I‚Äôve gotten a lot more responses than normal when I‚Äôve reached out for help with personal statements and scholarships. It‚Äôs been a really stressful process::: so I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôve had more time to dedicate to it. I‚Äôve also continued to be the community service committee chair and a mentor in the Academic Achievement Program. I run a mentorship and tutoring program called World Changers. It‚Äôs a partnership with a high school in the Bronx. We connect virtually with students every Friday after school to help them in any way we can. We aren‚Äôt just helping them write their college essays. It‚Äôs just as important to talk with them about mental health::: because we‚Äôre all struggling. We talked with the school‚Äôs directors over the summer::: and they really emphasized that a lot of their students were sharing that they don‚Äôt feel any type of hope and don‚Äôt feel like anything‚Äôs ever going to be normal again. In talking with other mentors::: we realized that we wanted them to be productive::: but also that we understand that something is going on in all our lives and we can‚Äôt just expect people to act like everything‚Äôs normal. One week::: we did a workshop where the high school students wrote personal statements. So many of them talked about having a family member pass away from COVID::: or COVID hurting their mental health. It‚Äôs affected everyone::: and it‚Äôs important to give a space where people can spend time talking about what‚Äôs really going on.‚Äù  ‚ÄîCasandra Delgado (NYU Gallatin School of Individualized Study '21) Concentration: Criminalizing Narratives: Advocacy::: Public Policy::: and Law Hometown Detroit::: Michigan,2020-12-10 14:16:04,He his you,Good luck!!,Great job !,Good morning friend am happy to have you as my friend God bless you all in Jesus name,VERY POWERFUL SPELLS AT ANY DISTANCE..CALL Dr Uzo +2349027640615 1-Bring back lost lover same day. 2-Control your cheating partner. 3-Seperate lover. 4-Get married to your partner. 5-Getting a child 6-FINANCIAL PROBLEMS. 7-Stop divorce 8-make your boyfriend to pay lobola.

The subway might seem germy::: but a new NYU Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service study showed that mass transit is not a major vector for the spread of respiratory viruses such as flu‚Äîa hopeful sign when it comes to COVID. ‚ÄúThe way people behave on subways is not the way people behave in environments we‚Äôve seen COVID spread a lot:::‚Äù noted Wagner Dean Sherry Glied. ‚ÄúPeople don‚Äôt talk a lot on the subways::: for one.‚Äù  NYDAILYNEWS.COM New NYU study suggests NYC subways are not a spreader of COVID-19,2020-12-09 21:42:56,Zionnah J Sheppard,Lmao what are we basing this on? The subway at its recent bare minimum capacity? A study released in the wake of a broke MTA scrambling for cash? We need the subway to survive but that needs to come from government investment and treating it like the essential utility it is::: not misleading people to take unnecessary risks just to try and recoup fares. The last two times I‚Äôve ridden the subway I‚Äôve seen maskless jerks::: people standing way too close to me for no reason::: and even a guy coughing into his bare hand then touching the poles. And these were off peak trips. Nice try::: but call me when this is duplicated at actual peak commute capacity.,https:// m.youtube.com/ watch?v=dYLbVuyC iko&fbclid=IwAR 214RsToKkufHXrt Nqz_wX15B2O8CDn vahe9-vJCJpbfir _f0J3IqcOaJU,What are you getting at...?,People don't talk on the subway Anymore::: everyone has the face in their phone,Try a packed train during rush hour ...,William Wenbo Wang,Places are not dangerous if people think it is::: and conversely.,"Much is wrong with this headline::: not least that ""is not a major vector"" does not at all imply ""is not a spreader"". Even if it were ""not a spreader"" (under current conditions)::: this would not justify taking guidelines less seriously::: though many readers will understand it that way. And of course the subject actually studied was NOT this virus and::: as far as I can tell::: was neither designed nor intended to ""show"" that mass transit is not a major vector of respiratory diseases of any kind. This NYU blurb itself wildly overstates the study's apparent import. Almost nothing worth reading can be found in the Daily News article either. It reads like MTA propaganda.",Except if someone infected is coughing without mask.,For almost a year now::: healthcare workers embroiled in the fight against covid have been struggling to convey to the public just how different covid is from the flu. And::: it is. This article states explicitly that research was based on the flu::: and not covid. It should not be used to make inferences about covid. This headline is dangerous.,Alexander Riccio,There is nothing intrinsic about subways to make this so. It is probably people‚Äôs already established knowledge about how unsanitary they are that has made them more careful. At lest::: not living there now::: I hope so. Keep up the good work taking care of yourself.,There's no covid it's A Lai,I will continue wearing a mask if I have to take the subway for long time.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs frustrating being a Global Liberal Studies student and not being about to have that global experience. Especially this year. As a junior::: I‚Äôm supposed to be studying away::: learning to cook in Italy or on a beach in Abu Dhabi. If you had told me a year ago that it would be this way::: I would‚Äôve said ‚Äòoh::: heck no!‚Äô But we have to make the best of it::: and maybe next Fall I can study away. At the beginning of the semester::: it seems like people were frustrated because it felt like the University was being too strict. But this is an unprecedented situation. They don‚Äôt have a guidebook for colleges to follow during a pandemic. Getting tested once a week and filling out the daily screen is tedious::: but what‚Äôs the alternative? Yes::: there‚Äôs a pandemic going on::: but when you zoom out::: people are quite literally fighting for their lives in so many ways. When I look back in 10 years::: I don‚Äôt want to think ‚Äòoh::: that was just a horrible semester. I just sat inside and did my classes.‚Äô I want to be able to look back and say that I went out and voted in one of the most important elections of my lifetime. That I attended a protest. That I did everything I could. I want to be able to say I didn‚Äôt waste a year or lose any time. I‚Äôm afraid of that::: especially living in New York. I feel like it goes by so fast. This moment won‚Äôt last forever::: so I look at everything that‚Äôs happening and::: rather than drowning myself in pity::: I realize that people are fighting for their lives. So much change is happening in the world::: despite the current circumstances. I want to be a part of that change::: even if it‚Äôs not part of what‚Äôs considered a ‚Äònormal‚Äô college experience.‚Äù  Rida Ali Global Liberal Studies::: 2022 Ashburn::: Virginia,2020-12-03 14:33:04,Hi everyone::: I highly recommend a very reliable and trustworthy hacking service It helped me spy on my partner's whatsApp and now I can remotely monitor it from my phone without anyone noticing.

I decided to take him grocery shopping.

"Last week::: NYU Tisch School of the Arts Drama students presented ""Everybody"" (directed by Candis C. Jones) and ""Forgive Us::: You‚Äôre Dying"" (Joshua William Gelb)::: two digital productions inspired by the fifteenth century morality play ""Everyman."" But rather than simply performing inside their Zoom screens‚Äîlike many remote productions have done during New York‚Äôs theater shutdown‚Äîstudents pushed the platform's boundaries for storytelling during a pandemic.  Using the same sophisticated software traditionally employed by designers to create visuals for physical and live performance::: students experimented with dynamic staging that isn‚Äôt stuck in a grid format. They learned the new skill of ‚Äúbox choreography:::‚Äù where an actor‚Äôs Zoom box enters and exits the screen::: or collides and overlaps with other Zoom boxes to create shared worlds within the play or evoke specific feelings in the audience. Director Joshua William Gelb‚Äîwho has been covered in The New York Times and New York Magazine for converting his closet into a tiny experimental theater venue‚Äîlikened the experience to ‚Äúacting in a CGI spectacular:::‚Äù where the challenge is to find the right eyeline to communicate with other remote actors and replicate the feeling of being in shared space.  Student designers also used digital manipulation to expand how plays are typically performed inside a physical theater. Using green screens::: they borrowed from surrealist artists like Frida Kahlo and Salvador Dali to create intricate and visually arresting virtual sets that helped integrate isolation and the remote process into the action of the story.  In ""Forgive Us::: You‚Äôre Dying:::"" shown in these images::: actors brought their characters to life in miniature tarot card environments and introduced surprising effects such as shuffling the cards. The staging was set up ahead of time::: and although the finished production looked as though it had been recorded and edited::: the play was actually performed and streamed entirely live.",2020-12-02 14:32:41,Call me now or whatsapp me +233246509322 A SPIRITUAL MAN from ghana I help people in my country and outside country like Zimbabwe::: USA::: South Africa::: Italy::: Libya::: German::: Nigeria::: so many countries friends don't lose your chance bring your problem for solution I promise you I will never regret from meeting I don't need anything from anyone I am here to help serious and interesting people I don't force and I hate lies and I don't promise and if you are facing problem like (1)instant money (2)work of leadership (3)money rituals DC move forward (5)lotto number (6)marriage problems (7) promotion in work place (8)luck of jobs (9)clint problem (10)sickness (11)court Case (12)traveling to abroad (13)police station Case (14)Girls friend boys problems (15)football solutions (16)luck of child (17)family problems (18)when you want something from someone (19)when you want powerful (20)when you need population inside your church or works (21)school of knowledge (22)you haven't a gold problem to remove (23)management of work (24)high sprit (25)protection (26)backet money (27) church powers call me now or whatsapp +233246509322,Felipa Diax,Bravo!,Where are they available,Artistically designed INCLUDING the entirety!!,Wow sir!,Following,That's amazing can't wait to be part of them,How can we watch them?

The latest community health update from NYU leadership outlines steps we are taking in response to a gradual rise in positivity rates on campus::: from the 0.3-0.5% that we'd been seeing to 0.7% now. We continue to see a shift with a greater percentage of the positive cases emerging from among non-resident students‚Äînot surprising given the spike in ambient case positivity in NYC. As has been the case throughout the semester::: there is minimal data to suggest that classes are a source of transmission.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a whirlwind thinking about the spring semester. I‚Äôll be closer to being a senior and things will get more serious::: so I‚Äôm a bit nervous. I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôll go back to New York for classes. I‚Äôve found all these great opportunities outside school that I can take advantage of being fully remote. I would love to continue to do that because I know there‚Äôs more out there that I can do in the spring. One unexpected upside of being remote is that professors can invite guests to come to class so much easier on Zoom than they can in person. In my film class::: my professor invited Todd Phillips to talk with us about his films. My journalism class brought in writers from the New York Times and the Washington Post who shared how their work takes them through life. I feel like I‚Äôve had a lot of freedom this semester::: so I‚Äôve been trying to take advantage of it while staying safe. I‚Äôve been able to meet people::: take gigs::: and be part of productions while taking a full course load. It‚Äôs great because I‚Äôm able to work on a job and then bring my experience back to class where I can ask questions and share information. I‚Äôve realized that I can learn and work at the same time. Even though it‚Äôs a bit strange::: I‚Äôve found that if I think about online learning in the right way::: it opens up a whole new set of doors on how I can work effectively and use this time well. I think the main issue is not physically being in class. That leaves it up to me to find motivation and ways to be hands-on. When I‚Äôm on campus::: I go to class and I‚Äôm assigned a crew. I‚Äôm in a studio and there‚Äôs a camera::: a mic::: and a script. I can‚Äôt do that right now::: so I have to do it myself. As soon as the pandemic hit::: I had to adapt. It‚Äôs been an involuntary test of how ready I am to be an independent adult and a working professional in the film industry. Filmmaking isn‚Äôt the same as it used to be. It‚Äôd be so easy to say ‚ÄòOh::: it‚Äôs shut down. There‚Äôs nothing else.‚Äô But there‚Äôs so many opportunities for me to be a creative filmmaker and visual storyteller during this pandemic. One of my favorite musicians says something like ‚Äòlimitations are the most freeing thing ever.‚Äô That‚Äôs become my credo. I‚Äôm limited::: but I can be resourceful. I have to be creative and I still have to deliver.‚Äù  Kirill Bykanov NYU Tisch School of the Arts and Arthur L.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like to quit things. I know a lot of people say that::: but once I‚Äôm committed to something::: I‚Äôm going to finish it. This semester has been a testament to how committed I am to getting my degree. Doing it at a time like this::: in these conditions::: has shown me how much I care and want to keep pushing through. I took two classes last summer that were supposed to be on campus. With everything that happened::: they got moved online and I took them from home. It wasn‚Äôt a great experience for me because it‚Äôs already hard for me to stay focused::: and everything being online made it even harder. I spent a lot of time weighing the pros and cons and talking with my parents and friends about coming back to campus. I knew this semester was going to be intense in terms of my course load and the classes I‚Äôm taking for my major. I‚Äôd worked so hard over the summer to get on track with my classes::: so the idea of taking the fall off was like ‚Äòwhat am I going to do instead?‚Äô NYU had a plan in place::: so I felt like coming back to campus was the best decision for me. I wouldn‚Äôt say the semester‚Äôs been great::: but I‚Äôm definitely appreciative that I can be here. The workload has been crazy::: but I‚Äôm making the best of it because::: at the end of the day::: I really want to be here. I feel like::: among students::: everyone has bonded together because we‚Äôre all going through the same thing. Even taking classes online::: everyone has been really willing to connect::: exchange numbers::: and get some form of contact. It‚Äôs a ‚Äòhelping each other‚Äô mindset.‚Äù  Sofia Monfiglio (NYU Tandon School of Engineering '23) Hometown: San Francisco::: California,2020-11-12 15:59:48,I too agree with you :::/Jacqueline Mattis class of pyschology:::NYU :::you are right first time people are bonding :::keeping each other safe is good:::super glad you went out because everyone is acting as if life has ended:::seeing you on campus will be a great,hungrer.carrd.c o,1) When those pictures were taken? I can assure you that everyone::: who stayed in NYC::: certainly did not have an access to any gym facilities::: let alone a beach to at least exercise on a surf board.  2) ‚ÄúKeeping each other safe‚Äù is an excessive statement. Why a simple cold is a thing causing huge panic? Why COVID::: knowing that it eventually will turn into a normal cold::: like other COVIDs did in the past::: is a matter of huge panic? Does anyone see that such ‚Äúpanic‚Äù mindset leads to depression::: let alone gaining weight makes both the rate of survival in COVID‚Äôs worst cases and the probability of getting depression worse? Why no one looks at those factors. Why NYU gyms are still closed despite this common knowledge?

"The COVID-19 pandemic has presented not only challenges but also incontrovertible lessons. Science matters. How we treat the environment matters. Understanding racial and societal disparities matters. Public policy matters. Evidence-based research matters. Too often these topics are dismissed as merely ""academic.""

In this profound and historic time::: members of the NYU community have treated patients on the front lines::: advised policymakers::: researched vaccines and treatments::: sent personal protective equipment where it's most urgently needed::: helped to improve testing techniques and understand the spread of the virus::: creatively reconfigured teaching and training::: and advocated for the most vulnerable among us.

NYU‚Äôs students have::: by and large::: been fantastic about observing COVID-19 safety protocols::: and we‚Äôre proud of you. The low::: stable positivity rates that we have consistently seen at NYU are attributable::: in large part::: to the conscientiousness shown by students.

The number of positive mentions of President Donald Trump on Twitter increased by 22 percent leading up to::: during::: and immediately after Thursday's debate::: while former Vice President Biden‚Äôs percentage of positive tweets remained the same:  NYU.EDU Trump Led Biden in Twitter Volume and in Positive Mentions::: Analysis Shows,2020-10-23 23:14:48,Twitter volume does not an election make. It's just chaos::: noise and hot air::: which is pretty much the basis of his entire platform.,Meanwhile::: 50 million Americans have already voted early. Most were Democrats. Elections are decided by people who participate::: not by people who tweet....,The good ... to win..,Am I the only want who noticed that Trump always called Biden ‚ÄúJoe‚Äù and never Biden called ¬∑‚ÄùDonald‚Äù to Trump¬ø? This is the best part of debates. Words became void::: what people feel from debaters makes their decision stand for the one they feel protection from. Trump is awesome on his own Majesty and is clear how Biden feels like an interrogated ISIS prisoner before the CIA boss...,Didn‚Äôt they just released data that said something like 90% of twitter uses are Democrat.... and only 10% of the population use Twitter...,If trump spent more time. Making America great. Which by the way America was great before he got his mitts on it. He lies. Instead. If crying on Twitter he get further. Trump get a mask,Makes sense.  From my perspective people who are likely to support Trump tend to be much more vocal and seemingly enthusiastic about their candidate than people who are likely to support Biden.  That is::: it seems to me‚Äî  Trump supporters are supporters because it's Trump.  Joe Biden supporters are supporters because it's not Trump.,Good!!!,Did they control for verified users?

Most people who watch debates do not view them to be persuaded but to ‚Äúsee how their candidate is going to dominate::: smear or embarrass the other candidate:::‚Äù says NYU's Jay Van Bavel::: an associate professor of psychology and neural science. Regardless of what actually transpires in a debate::: evidence also indicates that many viewers filter what they see in a way that aligns with their goals and identity. ‚ÄúWhen partisans tune into a debate::: they often walk away with an opinion that just confirms what they believed before the debate began:::‚Äù Van Bavel says.  SCIENTIFICAMERICAN.COM Presidential Debates Have Shockingly Little Effect on Election Outcomes,2020-10-23 00:53:53,...Or you could ask any European how smart they think Americans really are... No really on one side there is a (rich) Democrat supporting ideals and the poor and the black community and everything he cannot possibly know about because he is rich... on the other side there is a (obviously rich) Republican who supports racism (at least he knows what that means) and supports the other rich people like him::: and pretends to give a damn about abortion when in fact he likes to take a dump on women... So what are you going to do about it? Nothing my friend::: you guys are screwed. Obviously the Dems are the least of two evils but nothing is going to change.

498 of 502 of student-athletes on 23 teams‚Äîthat's 99.2% overall‚Äîregistered to vote thanks to a relay-style challenge started by NYU Steinhardt School of Culture::: Education::: and Human Development student Janean Cuffee and NYU Women's Basketball:  New York University October 9::: 2020 at 6:52 AM ¬∑  It started with a text to her teammates: You have 48 hours to register to vote. ‚ÄúI told them to like the message to show that they‚Äôd seen it::: and then to text back confirmation when they‚Äôd registered:::‚Äù says Janean Cuffee (NYU Steinhardt School of Culture::: Education::: and Human Development ‚Äò21). Then::: once all the NYU women‚Äôs basketball players had registered::: it was the men‚Äôs team‚Äôs turn. After that came men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs soccer::: with the same rules‚Äî48 hours to register::: no excuses‚Äîbefore the challenge was passed to baseball and softball and so on.  Janean::: a shooting guard::: had been tapped by her coach Meg Barber to coordinate this relay approach to getting 100% of NYU athletes registered to vote by around October 5‚Äîthe deadline to be able to participate in the November 3 election in several states‚Äîand she jumped at the chance. ‚ÄúThere are multiple studies showing that college students actually vote the least::: which is totally shocking because what we‚Äôre being taught is to use our voice:::‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúAt NYU we have people from all across the country::: and I think it‚Äôs important for them to be heard in every state::: regardless of who they vote for.‚Äù And unlike a mass email::: a personal text from a peer‚Äîwith a hard deadline‚Äîappealed to athletes‚Äô commitment to discipline and teamwork.  The effort grew out of conversations with Janean‚Äôs teammates::: who‚Äôd been meeting weekly (on Zoom) to discuss how they could collectively make change in the wake of the summer‚Äôs protests around racial justice. And it also fits in to a broader mission to combat inequality through education::: which has motivated many of the opportunities she‚Äôs pursued while at NYU.  An applied psychology major::: Janean held jobs as a mentor and athletics coach at Harlem Children‚Äôs Zone::: a writing tutor for high school students working on their college admissions essays::: and a research assistant for NYU‚Äôs Researching Inequity in Society Ecologically Lab::: which focuses on health and legal system disparities for traditionally marginalized youth and families. Through the organization Uncommon Schools::: which runs a network of charter schools for low-income students in New York::: New Jersey::: and Boston::: she completed a summer teaching fellowship::: and after graduation will teach in her own classroom while working toward a master‚Äôs in education.  ‚ÄúAll of the jobs I've had are centered toward helping people in general::: and specifically focused on making equality for underprivileged communities and children:::‚Äù Janean says. And she wants to emphasize that voting is another way of doing that.  ‚ÄúWe have a big election coming up:::‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúVoting is your right.

"An important update from President Andrew Hamilton and Provost Katherine Fleming about the Spring semester: ""Months ago::: when we first started planning for 2020-2021::: we hoped there might be a vaccine or a therapeutic widely available by the beginning of the spring semester that would diminish the impact of COVID-19 and allow us to resume some of our prior activities. Our hopes notwithstanding::: that appears unlikely. So::: barring any surprises::: we expect the spring semester to look very similar to the fall semester for faculty::: for administrators and staff::: and for students::: whether they are in our housing::: living off-campus::: or attending class or working remotely.""

‚ÄúThe war has taught us how to work together in ways that we have never contemplated before:::‚Äù wrote NYU Chancellor Harry Woodburn Chase to the graduating class in the 1944 yearbook. ‚ÄúIt has taught us how to do without many things for a while and yet we have made every effort to keep up the quality of our instruction. And it is a good quality. Reports of many sorts have come to me from many places speaking of the way in which the educational qualifications of New York University students stand up under competition with those from other places. This is a tribute both to the students and to the faculty and one of which we are proud::: as we are proud of the records of advancement::: promotion and bravery made by thousands of our former students in every branch of the armed forces.‚Äù #TBT  How‚Äôs that for #VioletPride? As the NYU community continues to adapt to the reality of COVID-19::: we‚Äôve enjoyed taking a look back at how previous generations dealt with other moments of historic uncertainty.

A message from NYU leadership on the New York State positive case threshold for colleges:  In late August::: New York State set thresholds for temporary suspension of in-person classes. For NYU's Washington Square location::: that number is 100 within a 14-day period. Even though our case positivity rate remains low‚Äîroughly 0.5%‚Äîwe are approaching that number.  Accordingly::: we have been in touch with NYS authorities. Based on our overall conditions‚Äîprimarily our low positivity rate::: which is significantly lower than the area surrounding the school::: and the robust program of testing‚Äîthe State has advised that at this point we should continue to carry on as we have been::: and do not at this point have to pivot to remote instruction.  We will remain closely in touch with the State::: and will::: of course::: follow any guidance and promptly relay directives about any changes from our current course.

We support and are committed to efforts to ensure that we are part of the solution that finally dismantles systemic intersectional racial injustice and violence. Indeed::: we need a commitment::: plan::: and structure to make it happen. But we also need to hold space for each other::: to give people room to feel and be seen and heard.  In the coming months::: the Office of Equity::: Belonging::: and Community Action will roll out new programs and services::: which will include::: among other things::: a new Social Justice Resources page where you will find resources useful in our struggle for social justice::: and a list of equity trainings our office will make available to our community.  Transforming a broken system is a big undertaking and will require the involvement of many people to make an impact. It is important to stress the need to embed our culture and all we do with social justice strategies to dismantle structural racism and its many antecedents::: without simply adding more tasks. In the spirit of systemic change::: we want to utilize the strength of our office to enable change. This means that::: in addition to offering resources and trainings::: our office will set up people-powered committees to galvanize our collective genius and community cultural wealth::: to hold us accountable::: and to help create the change we wish to see.  More immediately::: we want to provide a space for you to both hear from one another and be heard::: where you can share and discuss your stories::: feelings::: and experience with others.

A statement in response to Governor Cuomo's press conference remarks:  NYU shares the Governor's concerns.

That said:  ‚Ä¢ We have yet to find any indications that the event was organized or DJ'ed by anyone affiliated with NYU ‚Ä¢ Though the event was populated with young people::: it is unclear how many of the participants in the event actually were affiliated with NYU ‚Ä¢ The overall NYU student reaction to the gathering in the park was not supportive but rather highly disapproving‚Äîmany students reached out to the City hotlines to complain about the event and the unsafe practices they observed ‚Ä¢ Both before and after the event::: NYU took steps to specifically message students to avoid large gatherings on the holiday weekend ‚Ä¢ NYU's security officers are not law enforcement officers. They have no power of arrest::: are unarmed::: and have no jurisdiction on the streets of NYC or in Washington Square Park::: which is a City public park.

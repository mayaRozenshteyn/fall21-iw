A message from President Wendy Wintersteen and ISU Student Government President Julia Campbell: Protect your community and show you care by vaccinating and wearing masks indoors when around others. üñ• https://youtu.be/ZB1bgnhqPhM  YOUTUBE.COM Cyclones Care: President Wendy Wintersteen and Julia Campbell::: Fall 2021,2021-08-25 17:24:00,Should be an option shouldn't it?!? We all have our own opinion and choices! Pretty sad to say I went to college here when this is what they are trying to force on students. If yall want to wear masks::: but if students don't want to they shouldn't have to!,University of Mississippi (MISSISSIPPI!!! ) is requiring all students and staff to wear masks indoors and outdoors effective at 4:00 today. Ponder that.,People fail to understand how masks work. My masks protects those around me from my germs. Your mask protects me. So this whole ‚Äúchoice‚Äù argument is worthless. Essentially::: I can choose to protect you but you can choose NOT to protect me. - We used to be better than this.,Well whatever happens::: I‚Äôm just glad we were all able to put aside our differences and have such a nice friendly discussion about this.,Maybe you should do the smart thing and require it.,Guess I don‚Äôt care ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,Suzanne Berge Harrenga,Awesome message. Thank you. üíõ‚ù§Ô∏èüíõ‚ù§Ô∏è,Thank you for this message!!!,You‚Äôd think a university as esteemed in research as ISU would‚Äôve done some before posting this message.,This is not something you should be pushing on people,Charley Jacobs where‚Äôs our vid? ü§™,Gee Julia and Wendy::: it¬¥s all find and dandy that you are putting out videos::: but please tell us why no one on campus is keeping track amd publishing the Covid numbers::: and why no students are wearing masks in classrooms? You can PSA til the cows plant their bottoms in the quad::: but if you aren¬¥t forcing or implementin mask mandates::: you are wasting your time.,Urge and recommend::: as long as you leave the choice up to the students::: faculty::: and staff. Thank you Kim Reynolds::: governor of Iowa for signing into law the mask mandate bans and to the Iowa State Board of Reagents for their sound decision that protects freedom of choice for all.,Disappointed to see this. Wendy::: I have thought a lot of you for a long time. This is poor leadership.,Seriously‚Ä¶let‚Äôs take the mask off & you can put it back home when you go home,And while you can't force mask mandates you should also bring back Veishea!,Perhaps the folks at ISU can explain why the CDC and NIH both pulled mask effectiveness against virus transmission studies that were done a few years before covid (2016 and 2017) from their websites once the official position was to wear masks? I know they had them because I read them. That was after covid began and when Fauci was saying you don't need a mask and it isn't effective against viruses. Then::: the guidelines changed and the two studies were taken down. Maybe it was because both studies said that mask wearing isn't effective against viruses because of the size of the viruses vs. the pores in the mask materials. By the way::: the one of them said cloth masks were worse than surgical masks...for those of you who wear a cloth mask for days on end without washing them.,All of us need to use mask üò∑,If it weren‚Äôt for the athletic teams::: I wouldn‚Äôt give a flip about ISU anymore.,Amazing how some people get so bent out of shape over being asked to wear a breathable piece of woven fabric over their faces; I wonder how you all would do being a woman in Afghanistan right now.,Universities should be leaders in the community.

The effectiveness of masks in children as a viral protection is controversial::: and there is a lack of evidence for their widespread use in children.  The mask::: which originally served purely hygienic purpose::: has been transformed into a symbol of conformity and pseudo-solidari ty. The WHO::: for example::: lists the advantages of the use of masks by healthy people in public to include a potentially reduced stigmatization of mask wearers::: a sense of contribution to preventing the spread of the virus and a reminder to comply with other measures [2].  Neither higher level institutions such as the WHO or the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) nor national ones::: such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention::: GA::: USA (CDC) or the German RKI::: substantiate with sound scientific data a positive effect of masks in the public (in terms of a reduced rate of spread of COVID-19 in the population),I'm sorry::: but this is totally insane. When I went to ISU I HAD to prove I was vaccinated or I couldn't attend. Even though I had had the vaccinations::: I didn't have a record of it so I had to go and have blood drawn and tested::: to prove that that had already been vaccinated.,FAFO,Grow a spine ISU::: It was my understanding you were a Science and Technology Land Grant University. Yours truly::: an alum,Purely pathetic. As a graduate of ISU and a nurse I have never been so disappointed in the lack of leadership.,"Can someone help me understand why some people are upset about post?

Did you know that the Children‚Äôs hospital in Des Moines is stopping elected surgeries because they have so many RSV cases and other illness? They don‚Äôt need a bunch of little kids with Covid on top of what they already have.  My Freshman will be wearing a mask. The new Delta variant produces 1:::000 times more virus particles than the first Covid did. If you are in a room with 10 Delta positive and virus shedding people you will have 10:::000 more virus particles in the room than the first Covid strain. -Masks reduce the amount of virus particles floating in the air. If you breathe in a small amount::: especially if you are vaccinated::: you may not get sick. If you breathe in a large amount of virus particles your immune system has a lot more work to do and may not be able to keep up and you may get sick even if vaccinated. - If you cover your mouth when you cough and sneeze then you should wear a mask during a pandemic spread by coughing and sneezing.  Univ. of Illinois developed a saliva test for Covid and a procedure that will now be used in some high schools and colleges around the state. I wonder if Iowa State has considered doing the same.  https:// www.uillinois.ed u/shield,Enjoy your side effects,Winter Wilow,Cherry picking CDC recommendations for the health and safety of campus.,How much money does Iowa State get for vaccinating students? Hospitals got $ for Covid deaths. I‚Äôm sure it is all for the health of the students.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A person who has natural infection carries antibodies to both the spike protein AND the virus whereas the vaccine only induced spike protein antibodies. Additionally there have been studies noting long term immunity through natural infection through T cell and B cells. Those who suffered through the virus should be also treated as immune and not discriminated against.,Do not take an experimental vaccine::: young adults. Most young adults recover from Covid without even visiting the doctor. They do not know how it will affect your fertility when you want to have kids. Do your research.,Remember while living in Ames in 90's,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Vaccines are important tools to stop the pandemic. Campus vaccination updates and an FAQ that includes specifics about guidance and requirements are available on ISU's COVID-19 website: web.iastate.edu/safety/updates/covid19/vaccinations,2021-04-14 21:35:37,Don't forget to disclose that these are emergency use authorized products only and have not yet received full licensure from the FDA. This could be a legal liability if not disclosed to the participants. I do not see this listed on your website!! This is important part of providing legal informed consent to the patients participating.,Do we know which vaccine isu is giving,Maybe promote a healthy immune system before an injection üíÅ,I just read one of the takeaways of the governor‚Äôs press conference today is vaccination means no mask for college students.,The second ‚Äúbooster dose‚Äù is exactly the same as the first dose. In the FAQ it says they are different. Not sure why they are saying that.,This age group is largely unaffected by this virus and should not get this vaccine. We don‚Äôt have data yet as to how this affects fertility amongst other important issues.,The Vaers link to report::: which includes the explanation about the site ‚ÄúJust because an adverse event happened after a person received a vaccine does not mean the vaccine caused the adverse event.‚Äù https:// vaers.hhs.gov/ faq.html,Why did J&J get paused? Why did a Scandinavian country outlaw another?  Half facts ISU.,Stop the pressure on college kids to get vaccinated.,Michael Angelos VAERS is a passive database which anyone can use. It‚Äôs not a tool to establish a causal relationship... .it says so on the website. Just because someone died after getting a vaccine doesn‚Äôt mean they died BECAUSE OF the vaccine...peopl e die after going to sleep...did sleep kill all these people? I‚Äôm sure refusing dialysis in the first example of your link::: might have something to do with that death.,Mild flu no it's not::: G-d that tu reject fight against it naturally,VAERS - check it out. Choice matters. Also::: I personally know over 5 people who are experiencing awful side effects. One healthy 38 year old mom almost died. I‚Äôve also heard multiple stories from friends. People need to share their stories::: because bottom line this has not been studied yet. Not enough time. We just don‚Äôt know long term effects.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A family who always directly condemns the hatred and violence we see so frequently in our country and world::: through no unclear verbiage.  In a nation where we've realized that not all presidents speak up against violence::: bigotry and racism::: it's comforting and inspiring to know that the president of what has been many of our ""home away from home"" for four years::: will boldly take that stand.  Thank you President Wintersteen.

I am all for equality. I admit that the systems are rigged against minorities. However when you make statements like this for minorities but not when it happens to people in the majority::: we are continuing to fuel the resentment that brought us Donald Trump and Qanon. Dr. Peters made us read ""Hillbilly Elegy"" for one of his classes. Coming from an urban center it was a great look into life growing up in the more rural parts of America and it helped me better understand where both sides of America are coming from. Both sides are so wrapped up in the ""me"" culture they aren't taking time to look at what it is like for the other side.

Its origin is unknown.  Here's my proposal:  Perhaps it's a cognate of ‚Äòmask.‚Äô  Our English word ‚Äòmask‚Äô comes from French masque and Italian mascara::: which in turn descend from Medieval Latin masca::: ‚Äòwitch::: specter:::‚Äô another word of uncertain origin. It's also believed to have been influenced by Arabic maskara::: ‚Äòbuffoon‚Äô or ‚Äòmockery.‚Äô Alternatively::: it may have come from Proven√ßal and Catalan mascarar which meant to ‚Äòblacken‚Äô the face. By the 1570s::: ""mask"" connoted the figurative meaning ""anything used or practiced for disguise or concealment.""  [Parentheticall y::: all these words suggest descent from ancient Hebrew root ◊°◊ö (SC)::: which means covering::: as in succah (hut) or masach (screen). In fact::: mask is masecha ◊û◊°◊õ◊î in Hebrew. The m is preformative.]  ‚ÄòScam‚Äô could easily have been a metathesis of ‚Äòmasc.‚Äô  Think about it. Magic::: buffoonery::: masks. They can all imply an attempt to fool or hide the truth from others.  And scam means to defraud or swindle.  Interestingly::: just about every human image that google offered when I searched for ""scam"" depicted the person in a mask::: such as the one featured above. By very definition::: ""scam"" implies a masking of the truth.  So there you have it folks.  Masks are a scam.  Not just conceptually and phonetically::: but perhaps etymologically as well.  Don't fall for the scam.  Take off the mask.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Every person on this site is saying we want in person classes but I don't want my kid tested random than what do you want same shit that is happening now,As a current ISU grad student::: I think this is actually a great plan. One of my classes is in-person and it‚Äôs all older students that live off campus that didn‚Äôt need to get tested at the beginning of the semester. I love the idea of incentivizing students at random to get a COVID test to check for asymptomatic cases.,Watching the football game and noticing staff and players on the sidelines without masks and I am wondering AGAIN WHY my daughter has NO in person classes? Why the double-standard ? I know-\-\- $$$$. You all should be ashamed of the farce you have made of education. Covid19 must not be spread on the football field-\-\only in the stands and in classrooms::: bars and restaurants::: right?,Is this legal? Who is funding this::: both the testing fees and the prizes ?,So if a student submits to a test and tests negative::: them I assume they are then exempt from any mask-wearing mandate.

UPDATE: The spring semester will start two weeks later (Jan. 25) and end on time (May 6) with no spring break.

Let those wanting in person classes have that opportunity.,I hope you do offer more hybrid & face-to-face classes. All my son‚Äôs classes switched to online last minute - seemed shady. Please understand many kids need to have in person classes & do your part as an educational institution to serve your students!,Jennifer Michelle,Matthew Pritchett Julie Pritchett,My student has yet to be in a classroom...it‚Äô s all BS! This much money for computer classes is a crime. I hope she doesn‚Äôt return. Less school for Th e same amount of money...quite the gig.,Monica LaRoque Alyssa LaRoque,Sick world.

COVID might show up before that but it isn‚Äôt allowed to show up after the 25th?,It would be nice if we can cancel spring housing contracts.,Lisa Mustacci Model April MarieMary O'Malley Andre,Judy Fisher Martin,What is the purpose of pushing back the spring semester even further (despite our lengthened winter break) and cutting spring break? If the concern is spring break trips::: why not keep the calendar start date and just make semester end a week earlier?,I dont know if they are trying to avoid as much flu season as possible but I'd prefer an early start and go straight through. Hoping my daughter can take a winter class.,Bring back Fall graduation,My student is coming home this Wednesday. Ok so she gets screwed on the housing and meal contracts for fall semester. Well .... she had one in person class and that's online for her now. The food was awesome when she started .... now it's practically heated gas station food. Good thing is she won't sign up for her spring housing contact or meal plan IF all her upcoming spring semester classes go online. It's a shame. But she's coming home and we are very happy about that. We get more time with her. Everything else will hopefully work out in the end.,Does that say no spring break,This is our first year at Iowa State and I have to say I am disappointed that zero of my daughters classes are in person. What you pay per credit hour should be discounted if the professor chooses online. My personal opinion is educators should be considered critical. Teach!,No Spring Break? Might as well shut the college down ..,I don‚Äôt think Iowa State cares about students health. Actually I know they don‚Äôt.,I literally have professors who don‚Äôt teach this semester because they can be lazy and go online and just throw slides up and say ‚Äúread those‚Äù. Their slides aren‚Äôt in depth and have no notes. I‚Äôm so glad I‚Äôm wasting money on a shitty education this semester and paying for professors to sit on their butt,This Thursday is constitution day. Remember where Yu live!,Great plan. My Iowa State students like it too. It will give them an opportunity to work more over break and earn some decent money.  I have a son graduating this semester. Iowa State has been a great school! He has accepted a job offer too! He is fortunate to have in-person classes this semester #cyclonefamily,I cannot believe that all of my son's classes this semester are pre-recorded lessons! The instructors should teach via live sessions! Also::: why aren't the science and engineering classes in person? They're supposed to be hands-on learning! So disappointing!,Tell me again why you so-called experts at ISU are insisting on your stupid COVID19 restrictions. CDC releases survival statistics for people in their 20s and younger.....99. 99% survival rate! Tell me again these liberal dens of higher education are NOT playing politics with our kids‚Äô lives and OUR money.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""Together::: we must do everything we can to keep our campus and community healthy."" üìù President Wintersteen: bit.ly/3hiWtcL ‚ÑπÔ∏è Policy: web.iastate.edu/safety/updates/covid19/planning/students  PRESIDENT.IASTATE.EDU www.president.iastate.edu",2020-08-21 20:16:32,Stop harassing our kids. I‚Äôm tired of all this nonsense. If this is so dangerous you should have cancelled the school year and refunded tuition . These kids aren‚Äôt paying $20:::000+ to be locked away in their rooms taking online classes. ENOUGH!,Candace Ringham::: my son & his friends recently had 2 say goodbye 2 a friend because he decided to go home because of safety. His classes were all online. He was in the dorms though::: probably still getting charged ( I don't know). But with so many kids on campus not wearing masks::: he just felt safer. My son and his friends definitely understand. My son would come home but he has in person classes and online. Him and his friends just wear their masks when they are out. It bothers them that so many people on campus don't wear masks but there's nothing they can do. He knows CA' s in other dorms were kids don't wear their masks on the floor::: outside of their rooms::: but there's nothing they can do about it. My son loves his classes and professors and hanging out with his friends but he also wants to be safe about it. I'm sorry to hear your son is stuck in a lease::: hopefully the school actually does start doing something but I'm not sure they will because I was there after they made this statement and sent out the email and I saw a bunch of groups of kids::: no masks and not social distancing. There were other kids::: with masks or social distancing or both and that's what bothers me::: there's kids that are being safe but the ones that aren't are the ones who are making things bad.,Good! I‚Äôd really like my daughter to finish her college AT school. Time to grow up::: you‚Äôre not kids anymore. Follow the rules or go home to your parents. We paid a full year lease last year to have last semester online. If parents don‚Äôt want money wasted::: tell their students to get on board with the rules. Bitching about how unfair it is isn‚Äôt gonna change anything. Suck it up. We all have to::: now they do too. It sucks but it is what it is.,Help me understand this. If these policies are about protecting the students::: how do you justify encouraging out of state students to travel to Ames only then to be locked down with other students? This defies all epidemiology and common sense. In our case our daughters schedule is heavy with labs::: not something you can reasonably do online. We had some very long hard discussions about the possibility of her sitting out a year::: doing some voluteer and some intern work towards her major. When we received her schedule all labs were in person and classes online::: based on this she chose to travel from Texas for the year. A couple days prior to class her new schedule closed all the labs except one that has now been reduced from 2hours twice a week to one hour once a week. If this is really about the safety of the students wouldn't the prudent action have been to be upfront with us out of state students and had them stay home and take classes online?,It‚Äôs necessary because COVid Kimmie did not take her responsibility seriously! Never shut down the state....did not allow local to put in place mask ordinance. Complete failure to lead!,99.96% survival rate.,Re: Face Coverings: What about those who are Rape victims::: PTSD sufferers::: former child trafficking victims (not recognized earlier due to face coverings- Eliz. Smart) those w/medical conditions or those w/ panic attacks due to claustrophobia?,"You know what the biggest money grab in the history of earth is? Universities taking full tuition::: room::: books and board from incoming freshman who are desperate for the ""college experience"" and then once they get to said university they ""go online"" and then they punish you for not following assinine ""social distancing"" guidelines or::: worse yet::: having people try to enforce said guidelines that have no clue. I got took and it's my fault for falling into their trap. @IowaStateU #iowastateuniver sity #iowastate Shame on you. Shame on you. I want my money back. Sorry Jacob Burns::: this is just not right.",Eryka Dickey,Mini Sturgis Buffalo Iowa hundreds of bikers going from Bar to Bar......no masks no social distancing..... no outrage.....CoV id Kimmie‚Äôs Iowa ....this biker thing has been happening all summer ......no press,Go ahead and try to pull that trigger::: I'll be waiting.,"Well...good luck with that. And again::: I ask::: ""Yo::: 'merica. You okay down (below the 49th) there?"" Holding space for you all -",This Update tells students they have responsibilitie s. If they want to be students during a pandemic::: they need to help prevent spreads by not converging in groups in bars::: at frat parties::: etc. Otherwise::: it shows they are lacking motivation and maturity::: and might actually need to go back home and try to grow up!,Punishing the students for not following mask rules::: but don‚Äôt correct a professor for threatening to fail students if they don‚Äôt believe the liberal BS she spews . That‚Äôs a rich hypocrisy.,Funniest thing to me is that the people here angriest aren't the students::: but people in the age range that COVID has much more of an effect on. Virus kills older people::: older people don't believe in virus. Irony.,CJ Strike,Nathan Reynolds this is the post I was talking about,It isn‚Äôt about the virus. It‚Äôs keeping up the liberal narrative of fear until after the election. Trump 2020 to rid us of this circus.,David Grant,Does this include rioting? Protesting?,The biggest FU that we can give to universities trying to pull this BS is Trump 2020! This whole COVID thing is 99% political and 1% public health.,Have you fired Chloe Clark yet?,The policy the students signed clearly states ‚Äúon campus‚Äù correct? How is this not a violation of the students first amendment rights?,So will you be suspending all the people that are protesting? Yes A lot are wearing masks but none are social distancing at all.,Such a peaceful message at the peaceful protest on campus last night. I hope all those who weren‚Äôt wearing masks will be suspended.,As a black American citizen I am deeply concerned for the students of your new English professor Chloe Clark who is telling them that conservatives views are not allowed and has threatened to dismiss them from her class. She is openly oppressing their rights to free thoughts and free speech. For example telling students they aren‚Äôt allowed to even make a basis for arguments against ABORTION in their class papers. I implore you that she is reported to the English department head and Dean immediately.  Sincerely::: A black American female,But ISU is having a football game?,"""Together::: we must do everything we can to keep our campus and community healthy."" Hosting a football game with 25:::000 spectators::: keeping in-person classes and not shutting down all on campus housing is NOT doing everything you can.",This is not Iowa State University of Science and Technology. This is an institution that doesn't care about SCIENCE! Ashamed to be an Alumni. Keeping dorms open::: fans in stands? What does science say about this?,So if you don‚Äôt want the students to participate in mass gatherings why are you all hosting a football game with 25:::000 fans? I am an very disappointed alum.,Should have implemented these procedures last weekend instead of waiting to make National News. Happens every year the weekend before school.,I appreciate Iowa State trying to insure a safe start to classes. The blatant disregard for other people exhibited by the hundreds of students partying in the middle of a pandemic last week-end::: was very upsetting to those of us who live in this community.,Is this even legal??,I hear the dinning halls were an even bigger problem this past weekend. They didn't limit students entering which caused long lines::: huge wait times for food and not enough tables for the students due to taking out tables for 6 feet distancing.,Why on earth ??? Did even considered online courses just for the fall semester?,I'd like to see how Iowa State is legally allowed to tell students what they can do off campus. I see some lawsuits in their future. Used to have a high regard for Iowa state but not as much these days.,Awesome. Personal responsibility and consequences.,You guys are just going to make us go online in 3 weeks anyway.,Looks like they are setting the stage for suspending classes. Of course::: After the 3rd week so the students are financially bound to the schedule they are registered for. Let the drama scene continue....,So::: since this was just now mentioned::: the students who don't agree to this and no longer want to attend who've already gotten FAFSA or paid themselves are eligible for a full refund::: correct? I'd sure as hell hope so.,Thank you for making this the worse semester imaginable,Thank you!,All over a hoax.,Dumb,Toi Mills Lea McCormick Michelle Toubo White,Lost respect for Wendy today.

I don't know how they will ever enforce this!!,Welcome to prison...oops::: I meant Iowa State University.,https:// www.google.ca/ amp/s/ www.cbc.ca/amp/ 1.5694520,Finally::: but should have announced it a couple of weeks ago. Whoever doesn‚Äôt want to follow the health guide can choose distance learning so that those kids who follow the rules can continue live on campus and stay healthy,If you want to keep face-to-face learning::: this is how you're going to have to do it. If you want to be forced back to all online::: then sure::: disregard all health and safety protocols. But then don't complain when they shut down campus again. You can't have it both ways. We're all hoping that the day comes when we don't have to worry about this virus anymore. Until then though::: we all have to sacrifice a little so that that day will come a lot sooner.,Keep well and medical healthy everybody in ISU.,This makes no sense !!! People can go to adventureland with no mask and no distancing any where. But if you go to iowa state and don't where a mask off campus they may suspend a person ??? Wow all because it was on the news I am assuming. Kids can not even have fun anymore. üòî,LaCee Ann,They should have NEVER allowed students back on campus - ISU decision was totally irresponsible and premature to risk everyone‚Äôs health with dangerous consequences! ISU made its decision for financial reasons and not in benefit of its students - to enforce these health guidelines::: ISU campus would turn into Police State where students would be penalized instead of gaining education they paid for. Shame on ISU officials who put monetary revenues before students lives!,Worthless college,I am glad that when I went to college I was taught to think for myself and defend my position instead having to regurgitate bigoted and racist indoctrination.,Kurtis Snyder,Mask up ISU!,Will these students also be disciplined?,Ana Morales,Story County was trending in the right direction::: until the students came back.  https:// iowacovid19track er.org/ story-county/,Got a Snapchat of our son today::: sitting in his apartment bedroom::: watching his class online. The reality of this situation sunk in at that very moment. We are paying out-of-state tuition and rent for an apartment lease he couldn‚Äôt get out of so he can sit in his bedroom and take online classes from a university he chose for so many other reasons. I know he will make the best of it::: but boy does it make me sad. üòï,Very good call::: but too late I‚Äôm afraid.,Calgon...,A little too late::: should have been in place BEFORE they even came at all.

Imagine paying tuition for your kid to underage drink and party and thinking that‚Äôs what college is for ü§°,As an alumnus of the university currently working in the original outbreak region in a state that mandated these regulations early and is one of the only ones on the downtrend for this disease it‚Äôs the only way to stop it. I wear a mask every single time I leave the house. Get over yourselves::: stop being selfish::: and help the situation. I have friends who work at this university and I want them to stay healthy.,Y‚Äôall are embarrassing.,How about teachers that force abortion views on their students???,Why are we still packed on Cy Ride like sardines??????? ?,I‚Äôm glad that Iowa State did this. Hopefully students will take it more serious now and we can continue face to face classes.,It‚Äôll be a good day when you shut your doors you commies.,üôå,This isn‚Äôt unique to Iowa State to use the code of conduct to implement these measures. Bradley University just made the same announcement. Both universities want students on campus and are implementing some rules in effort to keep them there. Once the ‚Äústart‚Äù of school is past and the media quits seeking the big story and the first university(ies) to send students home::: hopefully things will calm.,How can they have any jurisdiction over anything off campus? A group of students in a study group gathering on the other side of town to study without face masks or go to Perfect Games to hang out::: a picture gets taken and they get suspended for it?? I don't see how they can legally enforce that.,Does the administration::: coaches::: faculty staff::: and ISU employees get punished::: if they don‚Äôt follow the guidelines? Set the example::: adults.,So my daughter that lives off campus and has all of her classes online is subjected to this as well? I‚Äôm not sure how they can do that.,And that is the way it should be done. These rules are in place have to be followed just like any other rules or guidelines.,that‚Äôs a joke.,Thank you!,God forbid they put those rules in place for health and safety reasons.,They knew when classes started masks were required and no large gatherings. ISU has worked hard to keep students safe. For those taking this seriously::: it isn't right for those who don't or won't.,I apologize for my sarcastic tone: What a ground-breaking email...telling students to wear masks or else. President putting the least amount of effort into processes and communications. You should check out some other schools communications and just cut-n-paste them because they are much more planned out then anything I‚Äôve seen from our Iowa school.,Unless I missed the genius invention of masks you can drink through I‚Äôm not sure how you drink in a bar with one ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,üëçüèº,Hey idiots!

Better be some big ass refunds!,Seriously people this doesn't happen every day and it's not forever. Wear the mask::: follow the freaking guidelines and it will be over much sooner!!,"What a draconian environment. Having read this threat from the administration::: it is easy to see how a ""professor"" assumed she could threaten students who express different religious or political beliefs. Glad we sent our daughters elsewhere.",Right on!!! People are not taking this seriously!!!,So... every kid that goes to the bars and parties will be suspended? Thats over half the students... they already went out last weekend... too late,Can we remind out town young adults that this is in affect? Same deal as Veisha::: the # of non-ISU students in Ames last weekend was very relevant.,Soooooo::: where was this stern warning last weekend when there were literally thousands of students out and about across campus with nary a mask in sight? ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,Absolutely ridiculous.... is this Nazi Germany? I love how your stupid rules/ stipulations come out after students had signed leases and Were led to believe they would be in the classroom. How convenient for you to take in all the tuition and the apartments to be guaranteed their rent money all to have the students be imprisoned in their rooms! Let the kids be kids....this is nothing more than the teachers unions throwing a hissy fit about being fearful of catching g the virus. If you‚Äôre that damn scared I guess you should re-think your career. We are paying ALOT of money to send these kids there and this is NOT what is good for them. I will take action if you dare suspend my kid.,I'm all for COVID 19 restrictions::: but threatening students with punishment for violating ISU's guidelines off campus seems like a stretch to me. I'd make sure you're legally protected before you do that.,The letter is pretty vague. What is the size of the gathering they are really prohibiting? In addition have they asked all ISU staff to do the same or fear loss of job? I understand wanting to be safer but this is out of control.,You gotta fight! For your right! To Paaarrrrrty!,Cause they cant just party off campus in secret..,Good.,My question is it says students must comply with the federal or state laws off campus::: THEN state they have to wear masks because the college said so. ??? I really don‚Äôt see where the college has the power to force students when not on campus grounds to do something that even our state hasn‚Äôt mandated. I love ISU and there‚Äôs a huge reason I picked Ames over Iowa City.,Thank you ISU for your continued daily effort to keep our students and your staff safe!,Iowa‚Äôs government needs to enforce a mask mandate like many other states. I don‚Äôt understand why this hasn‚Äôt happened already.,So tell me why aren‚Äôt you getting involved with the Fraternities and sororities? My daughter loved her freshman year and wanted to be involved more and live in a sorority. In most of these homes they have 13-20 kids sleeping in one room!!! It takes one kid to go to the wrong gathering! Disappointed with how this is handled,Ridiculous,People are paying a lot of money for tuition to have their rights taken away. Unbelievable. People act like this flu is making people drop dead on the sidewalk. Car accidents have a higher fatality rate then this flu. I guess everyone should turn their vehicle over along with constitutional rights so we aren't exposed to a potential automobile death. Stay safe folks! Wow!!!,The problem is we have asked people (youth and others) to shut down their lives for too long. Human nature can not stop living especially for a virus that won‚Äôt hurt 99.9% of them. This is going on foreeeeevvvvvee er and it just isn‚Äôt sustainable. At some point the elderly and compromised have to shelter while everyone else proceed. When will that be? After November 3rd?,ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,Just go all online::: refund students for dorms/meals::: and let us go home. ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èThis isn't hard Wendy::: my God.

Sincerely::: A black American female,Iowa State::: you were the decision makers in allowing people to move into dorms where people use shared bathrooms. To return to campus where people are likely to congregate closely without masks or social distancing. Don‚Äôt blame the students and call them irresponsible. You allowed this to happen. The fall semester was always going to be in jeopardy during a pandemic. Don‚Äôt blame the students. Take ownership and actions to protect them rather than just say these things and then blame students when this fails in a few weeks. Posts like this are setting the ground to blame the students for an eventuality that you could have seen if you just turned on the TV.,I‚Äôm curious what Iowa State‚Äôs plan is to implement the mandatory masks? My daughter said more and more are not wearing masks and it is making her and her suite mates in her dorm very nervous.,Im not surprised no one is following the rules.

The ISU students aren‚Äôt the only ones not wearing masks. We saw plenty of Ames residents not wearing masks either.,I did my part. Wear a mask every day all day as electronics manager at the north Walmart. Go home::: play some video games or watch Baseball. Will wear a mask to class starting Monday. Sad that many apparently don't care about others...,I'm assuming that we will see a spike in cases just like we did here in MN after all of the people were partying around Big Island on Lake Minnetonka on the 4th of July. Oh::: that's right::: there wasn't a spike just a lot of fear mongering on the 5th!,ISU tested Students and let them move into housing. Then 2 days later 2% find out they were positive.

Can‚Äôt wait for the surge because everyone‚Äôs biggest priority back in Ames is drinking and partying.,Irresponsible students who don‚Äôt wear face coverings when gathering put the health and lives of the faculty::: staff::: and their fellow students at risk. One of the things young people are supposed to learn at university is that it‚Äôs NOT just about themselves (they are not two years old) - time to grow up::: be a better community member::: and take personal responsibility. This was sadly NOT on display this weekend.,Thank you::: Iowa State::: for everything action you have taken to support safety and health.

Not all students are making that choice::: and kuddos to those students!! ISU has done everything a parent could hope for. Now we have to trust our children and the children of others.,If students want any type of face to face instruction they need to act responsibly. This is clear in the ISU communications and syllabi statements. I would say many students just blew it for everyone. They can explain to the people paying for their education why it was more important to join in Saturday morning Greek 8:01 (drinking) and campus town gatherings without masks than to actually attend classes.,2.2% test rate we are doing good,We saw one party on Welch yesterday that was over a hundred kids drinking no masks no social distancing.

Lastly::: if students return to fall season::: what do you expect them to do for entertainment on weekends!,For the presential classes how often are the rooms and labs sanitize ? Are the desks and chairs sanitize for every session? Will every classroom has its own sanitizer station?. Also::: as part of the admission process a vaccine certificate is required::: what is been required as evidence of health since no vaccine is available for Covid 19?,How about build your immune system? Nah.,My daughter is being told that if she gets sick while living in a sorority::: which mind you has 20 plus girls sleeping in one room::: she has to move out! My own state has limited gatherings to 10!! No refunds if she chose not to live there either! There is very little care if these kids get sick and money is the bottom line! I‚Äôm disappointed in ISU for not controlling this!,I live in an apartment complex on campus and if you get sick you are supposed to stay in your apartment or go home.. do they not realize in an apartment you share spaces. My classes that are face to face they expect us to take 20-30 minutes of class to clean and wipe down everything. Before and after class. If class is only 45 minutes::: I‚Äôm spending atleast half to sanitize things and paying for it. I‚Äôm paying to clean and not learn,No confidence in Commie Wintersteen.,What are you doing Madam President to adjust the ridiculous tuition in light of the fact that 4/5 of my daughter‚Äôs classes are ONLINE?! This is ridiculous! What did you did last year when the flu was going around? NOTHING! I expect a huge tuition credit on the Cy-bill!,Allen Keane,Why are people so bent out of shape about how ISU is handling this? If you don't like it::: go somewhere else or take a semester or 2 off. It isn't like there aren't an abundance of options out there.,How are they going to know/monitor any students health who are coming in to class who live at home::: apartments::: rent a house?,Claire Wolfe,At least one of my Cyclone sons (Jr year) learned today that all his classes & labs are 100% online. Is there any value for him being on campus this semester? Will professors still meet for in person office hours? Will there be evolving arrangements for study groups? I'm concerned he will not have a collaborative learning experience.

Are they being retested again at that time .,Morgan May,Glad my student isn‚Äôt living in the housing ....there is NO way you would be doing a test on her.

Same question applies to resident halls and living quarters including showers and other facilities?

Any updates for these students?,Majority of classes should NOT be held in-person in the fall. It is irresponsible::: especially with the continued rise in cases in Ames and in Iowa generally. Student::: faculty::: and staff health should come first. Move classes online for Fall and give faculty the time to make them awesome and accommodating. A last minute change to online learning will not be beneficial to students and is unfair to faculty.,Karen Christensen Goff,Please suspend all on campus classes::: dorm living::: and activities for 2020-2921. There is no other way to provide health and safety for students::: faculty::: staff::: parents::: and relatives. Foreign and American students will flood Ames and ISU campus with Covid 19. Then::: they will take Covid 19 home to parents::: grandparents::: and relatives::: as well as hometown communities from Iowa causing exposure::: pandemic::: and deaths. Have you not seen the daily stats for Story County where ISU is located? Covid cases are increasing daily at huge numbers before the infiltration of thousands of foreign and American students in August.,Alex Vanausdeln,Those kids will not be washing their masks like they should.,Madison,As a Senior finishing this fall and transitioning to Graduate in the spring::: I have spent a lot of time on campus. I have noticed students who take in-person seriously and benefit::: and I have seen many who zone out::: surf the web::: social media::: what have you. Even I have found myself doing this occasionally. I know not everyone does this::: and some really do benefit from the in-person experience with academics::: socializing::: making friends and enjoying the college experience. I get both sides of this::: I really do. But- there are times in humanities history where we must change the playbook in order to advance to the next chapter. It sucks::: but the right call is to have online-only::: with the exception of Vet Med::: and in-person hands-on experiences such as chemistry labs::: biology labs::: and things that really need that in-person experience. Let's be real- we don't absolutely need to be face to face for Econ 101. I've done many face-to-face classes::: I've done many online only. It takes more dedication::: time management and determination for online. But that is the mission of this school::: to transform us into determined::: responsible leaders. And part of being a leader is stepping up to the unknowns::: accepting temporary change::: adapting (Kudos to Dr. Croxdale for that one) and recognizing that the overall good and well-being of each other is vital. I struggled in high school and graduated from an alternative high school in 2012::: I didn't get to go to commencement with my friends. ISU gave me a chance and I have succeeded beyond words::: thanks to the schools staff and resources. It will be devastating to not attend my commencement::: but it is not the end of the world. I will accept it as it is my duty as a leader in transformation to adapt to changes as we work towards solutions. The health::: safety and well-being of my fellow Cyclones is more important than my personal wants. We are all different and learn differently::: so should we go online (and we should)::: those who do better in-person should be considered and worked with so we can all succeed together. ISU::: Ames and the world really is a better place when we care for each other and work together. It is a very difficult choice::: but the right choice is to go online until a global vaccine is available. It's not easy::: it's not ideal::: there are financial questions about it::: but it is the right call.,Regina Nick Congiusti,Allen Keane,This makes me second guess wanting to go. I guess the dining facilities will be closed since we cant eat with a mask on? What about people who can't wear masks because it causes difficulty with breathing? Will they not be allowed to attend? At what point does it end? Or will it?,Wow thank god! As a ames resident I feel so much better::: not. How about when all your college kids get together after classes for parties? Or Before/after football games that you so desperately need spectators at? You are being negligible to the residents of Ames.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If your degree does not have a clear path to gainful employment::: skip it::: get into workforce::: and take night classes.,Please suspend all on campus classes::: living::: and activities for 2020-2921. There is no other way to provide health and safety for students::: faculty::: staff::: parents::: and relatives. Foreign and American students will flood Ames and ISU campus with Covid 19. Then::: they will take Covid 19 home to parents::: grandparents::: and relatives::: as well as hometown communities from Iowa causing exposure::: pandemic::: and deaths. Have you not seen the daily stats for Story County where ISU is located? Covid cases are increasing daily at huge numbers before the infiltration of thousands of foreign and American students in August.,Why haven't they sent email's or posted when move in is? They said they would do that by Friday.,What happened to the multiple or hybrid delivery options for classes? From chatter on the parent page it seems most all classes are now listed as online. If so::: why bring them back to campus...,I want to know what adjustments will be made for tuition for all of the on- line learning being forced upon students. It's hardly worth $25:::000 to sit in a damn bedroom and teaching yourself. Since my student won't be using the buildings I expect a tuition credit.....I'll wait to hear. This is absurd....the students need to be in classrooms learning. This is just to appease all the old leftists professors who don't want to risk getting sick....just retire then. I am beyond angry by this notice that my child's classes will be online except for one.,Just dont voice an opposing opinion on BLM..or you will be failed.,Thank you for the information.,Dawn Fetters Rayl Steve Rayl,When will sorority recruitment begin now?,Brenda Lane Harrison Kayelee Harrison Madeline Nemmers,Jessica Shields,Luma Yasin,Do we know freshman move in date ?,When is Fall graduation ceremonies expected to occur?,Kayla Kathman,Amy Osborn,Anna DeBartolo,Abigail Charles,Nathan Kriegermeier,Jacob Holtz,Emily Van Den Topi,Donna Lenz Edwards,Libby Hrdlicka Fink Connor Fink,Robert Vavrick I wonder when graduation will be?,Jaxon Lehman,Will there be a schedule for graduation? In Nov?,Noah Majewski you have a very short semester!,Kerry Christie,Renee Genung White,Kenzie Van Eman,Dereck Garcia,Angelle Waltz,Heather Kinsey,Regina Nick Congiusti maybe university Iowa follow suit.,So glad they'll be back on campus!,Kelsey Frazier,End on November 25th! Lucky! I wish we had a super long winter vaca when I was there.,What is the plan for students living in a sorority? I have a Sophomore daughter that is committed for this Fall.,Hannah Meier Jenna Kerns Alderks,So how many less days of classes does this mean? Starting one week early doesn't make up for the weeks they end early?,Sarah Yacoub,Matthew Pritchett Julie Pritchett,Any word on if suites will still be available?,Lexie Taplin,Jean Hemer Ludwig,Tyler Arens Dani Montgomery,Tatiana Tomacic,Sarah Bahr Montgomery John Neer,Let‚Äôs also not forget about them requiring anyone that lives on campus housing to get tested,Kelly Knapp,What does this mean for December graduation? We‚Äôre way out of state and need to plan (or not!).,Justin Malcom,This is absolutely asinine. Wait till people start dropping dead from wearing a mask all the time. People - young people are starting to get pleurisy from wearing masks long term. These policies aren't based on science.,Ryan Hermes,Nick McLaughlin,Not to mention that didnt the WHO just debunk the asymptomatic carrier thing?,Are you inconvenienced by an earlier start date? If so please explain or simply like this comment.,Grazi Kleber Mendes,Mindy Rizzio Luke Steven Luke Caleb Luke,Norma Hartley Stecker,Jon Anthes,Amy Irlbeck Sherman,Jordan Alex Julena Pins Kunkel,Paula Harrill,Mikayla Hartl Leah Philipp,Interesting. My son's apartment lease doesn't start until Aug 20.,Julia Hejkal,Lisa Kruger,Brandi Hiscocks Ryan Hiscocks,Abby Nielsen,The semester is awfully short...why? Is tuition reduced???,Lora Allison Bird,Lauren Wise Loonsfoot,Everett Eggleston,Lori Popkes Emily Popkes,Haylee Beckman,Bailey Schaben,With the semester ending early::: what does this mean for graduation ceremonies for those expected to graduate this fall? üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,Was it taken into consideration that apartments don‚Äôt let students move in until around the 17th? Like campustown & BlockOne,"This is awful. I'm a senior this year ""graduating"" in December. I would rather take all of my classes online and at home in Illinois instead of dealing with all of this. I highly doubt any of us are going to be able to focus and get what we need to do done.",Mary O'Malley Andre April Marie,Jessica Kelly I wonder if this is for the vet school too,Tyson Lamb,Matthew Widmar,Mike Widmar,Judy Fisher Martin Lori Rector Quinlan Jody Stowell,Jacob Murray,Brooke Sonnichsen,Lisa Cavanah,I have already booked flights/hotels for December::: will graduation be moved???,What has happened to Destination Iowa for the incoming Freshmen?,Angela Willems,Good plan. Thank you!,How does this impact Rush week and Destination Iowa State? Also::: will suite living still be available since they are only 2-2 bedroom with a shared space?,Why the angry face emoji? Lol. ‚ù§üíõ‚ù§,Nicky TePoel Jacobs,Rebecca Wilhelm,Aly McGuire,Tyler Cooney,Will there be a change to the spring schedule as well?,Avery,Elizabeth Wilhelm,Lori Roberts-Knoebel,Lydia Broadhead,Do students have an option to continue online without returning to campus?

Four years. Free tuition. That’s #IllinoisCommitment.  Learn more and see if you might qualify ▶️ admissions.illinois.edu/commitment,2022-01-04 17:49:17,Sorry boss I have to pass on the promotion the raise will eliminate my kids tuition. Nice incentive for workers,Meanwhile College Illinois! 529 doesn’t include screw of i in its list of state schools we can get a tuition freeze for when we started saving into it. so while i saved for my kids’ tuition since they were born i knew from the jump my kids wouldn’t go to my alma mater.,I guess I’m a fool for stating a college funds for my kids !! Because we don’t get a darn penny for either of my kids. 2 kids in college and we are laying FULL price. Because we are married and we both have jobs we don’t qualify for any scholarships grants or financial aid ….,I’m surprised there’s so much hate in these comments. The fact that this program is helping so many is a miracle:::! it would have been so difficult for students like me to afford going to U of I otherwise. Let’s look at this program as a great start::: I’d love for programs to expand to families with more income. It’s wild that fafsa works off parental income while many parents do not contribute to college education.  Still commitment was is a godsend to 30% of students so that’s a major win.,"This completely irritates me. Many parents save for college tuition and are getting ""punished"" for being responsible. Never liked this school.",How lucky for them. Guess they are able to pay for it with the high cost of out of state tuition that we're paying.,Thank you donors for your commitment 💙🧡💙🧡,"Who is paying for the ""free tuition""? ...KATHLEEN",It's no surprise that UIUC should toe the line with other Illinois organizations in the mismanagement of your hard earned money.,Unfortunately getting charity is a poor motivator.,No wonder they’re so broke.,I could have used an Illinois Commitment,Where was this money 8 years ago?,👏👏 rising tide raises all boats,While the middle class drown. Thanks for nothing!,Is the state funding trade schools and apprenticeships for those not going to college who still want a good paying job?,I guess I’m a fool for stating a college funds for my kids !! Because we don’t get a darn penny for either of my kids. Valedictorian of his class and no merit based scholarships available because merit based scholarships are based on Financials not actual merit. We are paying FULL price.

It was frightening (but a bit fun). 🧡💙,Thank you Block I! And all of the Block I Blockhead and Block Chair Alumni!!!,Love this! And so happy our son Noah Nelson has been a Blockhead in Block I during his past four years at UIUC! He enjoyed his time on the North end every Saturday and made some amazing friendships. 🏈🧡💙,Remember well being in the section in the 60’s. Great Fun,I don’t know how they stay in sync but they do and I loved watching it on Homecoming weekend!

#ILLINOIS students::: faculty::: staff and guests celebrated the grand opening of the Campus Instructional Facility.  The new building invites the sharpest minds across campus to teach and learn in state-of-the-art spaces. Explore CIF. ▶ bit.ly/3Bd45Y7,2021-10-06 16:13:55,University of Illinois Urbana-Champaig n  The new Campus Instructional Facility has also been a major killer of migratory birds this fall as a result of window collisions at this poorly designed building. It'd sure be nice if the sharpest minds on campus could implement measures to reduce that fatality (such as effective window decals::: https:// abcbirds.org/ glass-collisions / stop-birds-hitti ng-windows/ ) and in the future actually design a state-of-the-ar t facility that was also bird friendly (think Milwaukee Bucks stadium). Now that'd be something worth celebrating. #ILLINOIS  https:// www.life.illinoi s.edu/geeb/ service/ 2019-2020-geeb-s trike-survey/,UIUC Keep it up!!!,Good job::: UIUC.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

📍 Morrow Plots | Harvest 2021  #ILLINOIS crop scientists::: interns and students recently hand-harvested this year's crop in the Morrow Plots.

Did someone say night game? 👀 🏈  See you there::: Illini!,2021-09-17 20:05:41,"In honor of Constitution Day (September 17th)  GEORGE WASHINGTON Deemed the greatest man in the world by everyone ⁠ George Washington was famous for his humility::: and was revered as the ""Greatest Man in the World"" during his timeline according to scholars::: noblemen::: commoners::: and even the King of Britain whom he defeated in battle. He was also the most famous celebrity throughout the world causing people to line-up throughout the countryside just to see him ride past on his horse. ⁠ What the 400 British ships didn't see when they sailed into New York Harbor to defeat George Washington and his ""ragtag"" untrained Continental Army who were fighting for their independence from England's taxes and laws::: was Washington's faith in God and his humility ― the latter being his most noted characteristic of which people wrote about in their letters and diaries. ⁠ Even the other founding fathers agreed that George Washington was the best of them all::: a man with no formal education. ⁠ After Washington defeated King George III and his army after eight straight years of battling::: the King acknowledged Washington as being the best man in the world for turning down the opportunity to be ordained King (as many people wanted to see happen)::: and also for handing his devoted army back to the Congress which had never before then been done by a winning war General in order for him to return back to his farm and live out the rest of his life privately at his home although later::: he would be pressured to become the first President of the United States of America in order to continue spreading his noble::: wise and humbling influence. ⁠ Washington's army in theory::: should never have won the War for Independence (also called the Revolutionary War)::: but they did even though at times twenty-percent of the army went without shoes or clothing having to endure hot and freezing conditions including walking barefoot through frozen lakes::: cutting their feet on rocks::: and having only to eat ""firecake"" at times which is flour mixed water prepared in a kettle over fire thus causing many of them to die from starvation and disease when Washington somehow never got sick like the others did.  Over the years::: his army came to believe that Washington survived gunfire and disease because he was ordained by a higher-order like when a thick-mist appeared from nowhere blocking out everything in sight allowing the Continental army to escape an attack so they could regroup and strategize. ⁠ George Washington freed all his slaves before he died::: some of them had been inherited from his father during times when even African people were selling their poorest and least educated people under the justification that they weren’t like humans::: because they were primitive in culture and tradition. ⁠ It’s unfortunate that Washington::: and all the other good people couldn’t have afforded to purchase all the slaves and give them dignified jobs::: beautiful places to live::: and an educations like many did::: but there were about four million slaves in the end and nobody was rich enough to purchase them all::: especially after the invention of the Cotton Gin which rose America to being the producer of about three quarters of the world’s cotton.  This amassed some of the biggest fortunes during those times which caused many evil and greedy people to raise the price of slaves to 7 or 8 times higher AND it also posed more danger to slaves overall when talking about abolishing slavery during a time when the people making fortunes from it were never more power hungry who would rather see the slaves killed than become free as proven when they hunted down slaves after they were freed. ⁠ Washington's great friend Billy Lee was a black slave that Washington purchased and saved from a potentially horrible fate. Billy Lee::: rode aside Washington for the 8-years they fought together as a best man and friend. ⁠ Fritz Hirschfeld a historian wrote that::: ""If Billy Lee had been a white man he would have had an honored place in American history because of his close proximity to George Washington during the most exciting periods of his career. But because he was a black servant::: a humble slave::: he has been virtually ignored by both black and white historians and biographers.” ⁠ George Washington::: top scholars::: innovators::: and the founding father’s who worked on developing the U.S. Constitution knew that the Constitution was better than them selves::: and that it was the best attempt to give power to the people NOT the evil that will ALWAYS find itself employed in government. ⁠ They all knew the slaves must be freed for the Constitution to become all that it was written to be::: but knew a gradual approach to freeing the slaves was the best way to protect them from being killed::: and to plan for their integration into society as free and equal people.  Many Africans came to America of their free will settling first in Portland::: the melting post of vast religions::: languages::: and foreign cultures getting along together and excited to be living and exploring the ""new world"" of which they didn't originally know was already inhabited by hundreds of Indian tribes::: some unfriendly like the Shawnee who captured and tortured one of Daniel Boone's sons to death::: and were known for scalping the much different looking foreigners.  Many of the tribes were friendly and showed the foreigners how to grow food and navigate through the uncharted and dangerous terrain::: some of them even partnered with the British by guiding them through forestry during the war.  Washington called the Constitution “The Great Experiment” and I personally believe it is worth dying for::: just like our Bible is and ancient history which have been removed from public education.⁠ ⁠ GEORGE WASHINGTON QUOTES:⁠ ⁠ “The fate of unborn millions will now depend::: under God::: on the conduct and courage of this army.”⁠ ⁠ To be prepared for war is one of the most effective means of preserving peace.” ⁠ “Government is not reason and it is not eloquence. It is force! Like fire it is a dangerous servant and a fearful master. Never for a moment should it be left to irresponsible action.” ⁠ “It should be the highest ambition of every American to extend his views beyond himself::: and to bear in mind that his conduct will not only affect himself::: his country::: and his immediate posterity; but that its influence may be co-extensive with the world::: and stamp political happiness or misery on ages yet unborn.” ⁠ “The time is near at hand which must determine whether Americans are to be fre",Let's Go Illini!!! 🧡💙,is this streaming live,Win Fighting Illini Win,They should have never lost!!!,Tasha Willard,🧡💙,🧡💙🧡💙,Alexander Johnson,💝💝💝,Can't wait!!,Oskee-wow-wow🏈🏈🏈,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Four years. Free tuition. That’s #IllinoisCommitment::: and it’s a standing offer.  Learn more and see if you qualify. ▶ https://bit.ly/3z11ezs,2021-09-09 14:55:21,Tuition for low income families should definitely be free. Very happy for that. That said- rich feel nothing and it's the married::: middle class that have to jump through hoops to pay for college. So if you both do your part in society- work-\-\- and keep your family together-\-\- stay married-\-\- you foot the highest percentage bill than any other demographic. Getting divorced and breaking up your family is the best way to get free college.,Same here second year with my daughter at Blackburn College and thank goodness this girl works her tail off for scholarships which have helped tremendously but her dad and I will be helping her pay back too I don’t think u cud ever put enough back and live life::: also my son will b a senior next year and then we will have two to b helping 😩,"I'm all for giving kids a break for college::: truly I am. However::: I have a hard time when my kid had 4.0 + all four years of HS in honor classes::: great SAT score::: on top of three sports a year::: and he got zero. No::: it's not free::: me and every other student/parent is paying for all the ""free"" tuitions as it's passed on to us. Sorry::: love the school and it's a great education::: but not thrilled to see this ad daily.",Wonderful beautiful and for the unhappy people that feels like this isn’t fair Go Kick Rocks !!!!!!’,Fantastic! As a first-gen college grad and now university professor::: I'm proud that my alma mater has prioritized access to higher education.,I am glad students have this now but man... I really wish this was around when I went 🙃 $36k in student debt is wonderful.,Single parent in a middle class job and got nothing off of tuition. Two years in and 70 grand in debt. College is way too pricey,"For those of you complaining. Just be glad that your family income is higher than $67K. This program only covers those tuition and fee costs not covered by other federal and state grants. From the website. ""How is Illinois commitment funded? Eligible students will receive a financial aid package that provides scholarship and grant funding to cover the full cost of tuition and campus fees not covered by other federal::: state::: institutional and private awards including the Federal Pell Grant and the State of Illinois MAP Grant.""",My daughter is one of the intelligent ..and lucky students who has been granted this blessing! Her hard work and intellect got her here and the world will be a better place because of this! She’s going places! (Social Work major),A great education for my son from this low income single mom who struggled. Pell grants and fed loans were the only thing offered to us. However he did score several thousands in scholarships. He’s entered a high paying job in the finance world thanks to his time at IL. A world class university especially for finance and engineering. Thanks Illini!,I would hope they would offer some assistance to those who have been faithfully paying on loans for 15 years,So my question is who pays for this if the kid drops out before finishing the 4 yrs?? The tax payers or the kid? I hope that would be on the kid if they didn’t finish with the commitment,I feel for the taxpayers and blue collar workers who just got screwed with more taxes and another input that college elitism is important while the masses can toil and kiss their butts.,🎓🎓🎓,Lee Jenner No Elle I literally wanna cry,🤩,Emma Rice !!,My four years at the U of I were tuition-free thanks to an Illinois State Scholarship in the late 50s and 60s::: but tuition was very low back then. This seems to be similar to what I had::: most of the same requirements::: some new::: but we had to take an exam first in high school to qualify. Great deal.,Nothing is “free.” Someone is paying for someone else’s education.,It’s really unfortunate that Illinois does not offer any border state reciprocal instate tuition agreements like other Midwest states do. Nor does Illinois offer Legacy instate tuition scholarships either. As an alum who now lives in MO this is very unfortunate. University of MO offers both of these things… border state residents get instate tuition as do legacy students. Other Midwest state schools also have similar scholarships available. And::: Illinois’ instate tuition is much higher than other Midwest state school tuitions to begin with. It’s very sad to me that it’s so much more expensive to go to University of Illinois than comparable state (“flagship”) schools. Which makes Illinois not even an option for my children. 😕,There is no free tuition. Some one has to pay for the cost of education. All that has been done is to shift that expense to tax payers and other financial sources. Free tuition is a false concept.,Evelyn Gonzalez,Matt Cook,Cristina Ocampo,📋💫💫💫📚,"It's hard to make a change!!!!!! Our greatest fear😒😒 in life is making a change::: You've been mislead::: deceived and betrayed::: that doesn't mean that you can't be among those group that testify💃💃 :::doesn't mean that you can't be among those group that can overcome obstacles and move on🏊🏊🏊 it doesn't mean that you won't be able to achieve your dreams....We were born to make manifest::: make changes and be who we want to be::: It's never too late to plan for a better future::: invest and save now so you can build a better empire for yourself and family.

These Illini are destined for great things!,"Kind of a sad statement that UIUC pats themselves on the back for having ""the largest number of in-state students since 2018 and the second largest in 10 years.""

📍 The Undergraduate Library  The UGL sits underground in the heart of campus. It was built underground for a few reasons—both to maintain symmetry of campus buildings at the time::: and also because the architects didn’t want to cast shade on the neighboring Morrow Plots.  This winter::: a team of architects will embark on transforming the Undergraduate Library building into a facility that will house the University Archives::: the Illinois History and Lincoln Collections and the Rare Book & Manuscript Library.  This work will kick off the first phase of a multi-stage project that will include the redevelopment of the 100-year-old Main Library Building as a rich hub of research and learning for the University’s community of humanities and social sciences scholars. It is slated to be completed in 2024.,2021-08-05 23:19:08,I took the “deuce deuce” Illini bus to the “UGLi” many times! Ahh memories. 🙂,Theres a main library?

Keeping other people safe must REALLY bother some of you.,I love this school and how much they care about keeping all of us safe. Vaccines are the safest way to protect us all and will ensure us to have a great school year. Also::: many vaccines are required for students to attend public schools in America anyway. This is no different. U of I is doing it’s best with the information at hand and they are doing a fantastic job. Vaccines for the win ❤️,I hope some students are reading and know they do not need to get the vaccine and if you dont you just need to still get tested 2x a week and wear a mask. Makes some sense for those who already had covid or dont want to get vaccine. Didnt dr fauci say at one time if you had covid you do not need vaccine?,You still have a choice. If you don’t want to get vaccinated you don’t have to. You just have to wear a mask and get tested.,Wow....,I’m so ashamed of this school. I don’t even tell people anymore that I graduated from here. If you’re a critical thinker::: you’re called a Karen::: apparently::: and told to show your science credentials. Sorry::: there’s no documentation for common sense.,The student who chooses not to be vaccinated can continue with testing and wear a mask.,Yeah good ideal to keep them safe,Wow.... There are so many anti-vaxxer alums on here! Oh and some are racist too!  This is freaking scary how uneducated of the educated people are.

Does anyone know why students are required (unless you want to keep testing and wear a mask) to get it but faculty and staff is not? I think it’s required for all at IU.,For those of you freaking out about this. It’s still a choice to get vaccinated or not. If you choose not to you can still attend you just have to wear a mask and get regular covid testing.

At this point I’m out of patience and just thinking “OK::: don’t. But you’re an idiot.” 🤷‍♀️,Two things can be true at the same time: 1) it is probably in your best interest to get vaccinated and 2) vaccine cards shouldn’t be required for full access. It’s been many years since I was proud to be from Illinois and a UIUC graduate.,There is Supreme Court precedence for States to mandate vaccination of citizens. However::: these vaccines are available under an emergency waiver right now. Until the vaccines have been 100% approved by the FDA::: they should NOT be mandated by any State - ESPECIALLY FOR YOUNG PEOPLE::: OR FOR THOSE WHO'VE ALREADY HAD COVID!,What happened to “my body my choice”. This vaccine has only been authorized for emergency use. We do not know what long term effects it will have on adults::: and children. You are essentially telling students that they are not entitled to attend in person classes (that they are paying for) unless they are willing to potentially compromise they’re long term health. I am astounded by this decision. Are you prepared for the lawsuits? Just glad my children are done there. Disappointed,Wao that’s good idea,McKinley was such a horrible student clinic back in the 1990s.,This is disgusting.

"Altgeld Hall: home of the Department of Mathematics::: the University Chimes::: and a rich 122-year history. 📚⠀ ⠀ Constructed in 1896-1897::: it was first used as the University Library. The building was designed by two University of Illinois architecture professors::: who were part of only the second Architecture Department created in the U.S. They termed its style ""Modern Romanesque"" and said it derived from medieval church architecture. The interior included four murals::: designed and executed by Newton Wells. ⠀ ⠀ In 1927::: Altgeld Hall became the home of the College of Law. It was renamed in 1941 to honor John Peter Altgeld::: the governor of Illinois from 1893-1897 and an instrumental partner in the development of the University at the time. His vision and support significantly influenced Altgeld Hall::: as well as the four other castle-like buildings found at Illinois public colleges (SIUC::: NIU::: ISU::: and EIU).⠀ ⠀ The Department of Mathematics became the residents of Altgeld Hall in 1956::: and it was added to the National Register of Historic Buildings in 1970. Perhaps one of the most notable additions to the building was the University bell chimes in the tower::: installed in 1920 as a gift from the classes of 1914 through 1921. They ring every quarter-hour and are heard across campus. 🎵",2021-07-09 15:40:53,The University of Illinois is embarking on a project to restore and renovate Altgeld Hall and replace its neighbor across Wright Street::: Illini Hall::: with a new building.

You could go up a half flight of stairs and be on the same floor or a different floor - there was an elevator with buttons 1-5 for the 4 story building. If you pressed 5::: it stopped somewhere in the middle and the back elevator door opened. There was a door with a 3x3 space::: empty and brick walls. The name on the door was the nom de plume of a group of mathematicians - one hallway between the back and front of the building went right thru a lecture hall. Occasionally people would start walking through and not realize it. - another hallway had a set of doors that looked like it ended::: but open the door and the hallway continues - my office was in the basement. You could only get to it via certain exterior doors. I had to tell students if they wanted to visit the office they had to use those doors or ""you can't get there from here""",Lots of awesome memories and great friendships made here while I worked on my PhD.

📍 Round Dairy Barns  These round barns are the inspiration of Wilbur Fraser::: the first head of the Department of Dairy Husbandry at Illinois in 1902. Fraser was a strong advocate of round barns::: as they offered dairy farmers “economy of consideration::: low maintenance::: and labor efficiency.” He also cited the barns’ ability to better withstand prairie windstorms.  Fraser and the University’s barns were instrumental in popularizing the round barn style found throughout Illinois. The first barn was built in 1907-08::: and the second and third about 1910.,2021-07-01 17:08:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Starting this fall::: the university will require students who are on campus be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 before the semester begins. Fully vaccinated individuals will not have additional COVID-19 health and safety obligations::: such as participating in the testing program and wearing face coverings.  + We acknowledge some individuals have health conditions or other reasons why they cannot be vaccinated. For those individuals::: the COVID-19 testing program and face coverings will continue to be required.  + Individuals who have not had their Vaccination Record Card submitted & verified in the MyMcKinley Portal will be required to test and wear a face covering.  + The university is accepting COVID-19 vaccines authorized for emergency use by either the U.S. FDA or World Health Organization. If you are unable to access one of these::: you will be able to receive an accepted vaccine when you arrive to campus.  + The CDC has shared data showing COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective::: and fully vaccinated individuals can start to resume most aspects of pre-pandemic life.  We will provide more detailed information on requirements::: policies and expectations in the coming weeks. Thank you for your continued patience and understanding as we navigate this next phase.  MASSMAIL.ILLINOIS.EDU COVID-19 Vaccination Expectations for the Fall 2021 Semester,2021-06-21 17:52:27,Public schools have required that students be vaccinated for decades. This is not new.,A great decision. If you don’t want to get vaccinated::: you can choose to go elsewhere. 👍 I hear Liberty University admits just about anyone.,It is what it is !get it or don’t attend college there ! Period!,Awesome news::: thank you for being a responsible university. GO ILLINI. 🙏🥰🎉🥳,Good decision. Provide alternative for those who are not fully vaccinated yet keep every student and staff safe.,Good for the University of Illinois. I wish Illinois State would do the same thing. Our numbers are down since they left town but they will skyrocket like last fall if they come back and start partying in big groups unvaccinated.,I fully support the University’s decision - proud to be both an alumna and an Illini parent!,So happy that an institution of higher learning is using science and facts to determine its Covid policy. As it should!  Edit: I didn't think this would be needed::: but NO SARCASM HERE.,Unfortunately::: it does not sound like they are requiring the vaccine. Just that if you aren’t vaccinated you have to get tested and wear a mask (they will not be able to enforce the mask wearing because they won’t know who is vaccinated or not!). Very disappointing! It should be REQUIRED that ALL students are vaccinated::: period.,Does this mean more in person classes will open up? If Vaccinations are required why are so many classes offered online? #notright,If you already have the antibodies::: you should not be required to get the vaccine.,Everyone commenting how great it is::: isn’t even directly effected by the decision I’m sure🤣,Proud of the UI and how well the campus has done with Covid-19. We haven't had nearly the problems with it that many other universities have. Good job to all involved! (I have to admit that the whiners and science deniers here are entertaining::: but you'd think they'd have learned something by now. Guess not.),Thank you UIUC for following the science. My daughter will be a freshman this fall and is fully vaccinated and looking forward to a close to normal college experience.,What will they do about events on campus::: football and basketball games::: concerts at Krannert. Will they require all attendees::: many of whom are not students::: to show proof of vaccine or else!?,The benefits should outweigh the potential negative effects. If you make it mandatory will you pay for adverse effects???,Would a student that already had covid have to get the vaccine?,What is the point of the vaccine if non-vaxers have to be masked?,"Shame on you University of Illinois for filtering out comments that you decide are not relevant to this conversation. ie. ""Most Relevant is selected::: so some replies may have been filtered out""",Do what we say or be blacklisted. Perfect stance for a university where there is supposedly freedom of thought::: etc. Let people weigh their own personal risks and make their own decision. One of the few times I’ve been embarrassed to have spent 7 years at the school. Not a good day/,We don’t know enough about this vaccine to make it mandatory!,good to hear/know this! doing the right thing!,Isn't this a line from the I-Robot movie... . Thank you for your continued patience and understanding as we navigate this next phase.,That is totally wrong! Federal law says you can't mandate that which had one been approved for emergency use. This needs to be stopped!!,I really love this University and I wish I could be a graduate from this University..can someone help out...am a Cameroonian of age 26 ..I love civil engineering ..,Making our college decisions for my son easier...cross off U of I!,Well it is what it is. I don’t see anyone leaving or dropping due to a shot.,Thank you Illinois for keeping us safe 💙🧡,Very disappointed in UI to mandate this when the science shows risk to young people is very very low and herd immunity is now in effect.,I’m all for vaccines::: but how can UI mandate something that isn’t FDA approved? 😳,Pfizer vaccinated and excited to start in August 🥰,How will you know who needs to wear a mask unless you are making people wear their cards?,Hw can I become a student...pls some1 help me out,Students are required but not faculty and staff?!!?! No one thinks this is insane?,Good,YES!!! Thank you for doing this!! All 12 public universities in our state should be doing the same.,No need to do the COVID test for those who are fully vaccinated.,Sonia Lazaric,Charlotte Carmona Walt,If some::: (let's just say half::: for reference)::: of the students have been vaccinated::: they shouldn't have to worry about the students that chose not to::: right?,(745 ILCS 70/5) (from Ch. 111 1/2::: par. 5305) Sec. 5.

What I would like to know from the University is why those who choose::: for whatever reason::: not to be vaccinated are being told they must continue to wear a mask? Are you concerned with protecting those who choose not to get the vaccine or is it to protect those who got the shot? Shouldn't wearing a mask be left optional to each individual?

Mandating college aged students get an experimental shot when the risk of death is extremely low in their age group is unnecessary::: unethical::: and immoral. Furthermore::: mandating students get this shot while preserving health freedom for staff is hypocritical. A for profit medical product should NEVER be mandated for anyone. Especially products made by hugely profitable big pharmaceutical companies with a histories of unethical and immoral practices as evidenced by a plethora of drug recalls. I am ashamed a public university like Illinois is mandating a for profit medical product. Students should have freedom of choice just like the staff. I’ll never support my alma mater so long as this ridiculous mandate is in place.,They think if there students are fully vaccinated that they don't have to wear masks::: and they are safe from covid19 😆😆🤣🤣🤣🤣 what a joke::: Even when your fully vaccinated you can still get covid 19.The vaccin just pervents you from dying from it. vaccinated ppl still need to wear a mask. .

Young college-age men especially are having adverse heart-related issues due to vaccine. Anyone who already had Covid has just as strong if not stronger protection than the vaccinated. Vaccinated people::: per the manufacturers::: can still get/ give Covid::: it just masks symptoms. Also::: the mask theater has also been proven to be a joke. If the vaccines work properly::: there should be no hysteria & fear over the non-vaccinated. I feel sorry for the current students there::: especially the females who most likely will want to have children in the future::: since it’s now been scientifically shown that the spike protein is migrating to the female reproductive organs. U of I had been an utter disappointment to me for years.

People only ""feel safe"" because they are easily mislead and like to be ruled by others. The people with common sense should not enable those with emotional issues.

Congratulations to all of you on this incredible accomplishment."" – Chancellor Jones",2021-05-13 17:10:48,Congrats to all graduates.,Congratulations graduates!,Would have been nice if you had tried to have in person graduation with guests. With so much land there and a huge football stadium it could have been done - at least for the grad programs .,Chancellor Jones is so cool!,Thank You UIUC Graduates,"Why is graduation 'incredible""??",Congrats to all 🧡💙,Those masks are an embarrassment to the University So much for being a home to critical thinkers and those who believe in science,Noah Nelson! You were just talking about wanting to get a picture with Chancellor Jones next year! 🧡💙,Proud of you all,I 😍 Chancellor Jones.,Congrats!!,Should have taken off the masks for the pictures.,There should be a full-sized cardboard cutout of the Chancellor at the Stage Crossing sites.

1915 Illinois Commencement—when you could drive up to the quad to get your degree. 🎓  Thanks to the Richmond Family Welcome Gallery for providing this historical image.,2021-05-12 16:18:02,Cannot believe this is happening!!

No exceptions. Most big ten schools are doing all in person this semester.,Will not be spending my $ for my daughters education at my alma mater with this kind of garbage. Plenty of schools & colleges did none of this excessive testing & there were absolutely no issues. They were also in person full time. Very sad I can’t recommend Illinois to anyone at this point.,I had a lot respect of U of I after this Bs I no longer think this is a good school!!  Forcing people to get something unwillingly to enjoy learning is literally BS!,Theater challenges me. Especially the idea of writing your own skit.

Only difference being they need to continue testing?,Bonnie Graff I spent an inordinate amount of time on the Quad::: photographing for the Daily Illini::: partying::: and even had an outdoor class whenever weather permitted in the spring. A Contemporary Culture class by a T.A.::: named Mike Warren. Best 2 semester course I ever attended.

Glad Alex didn’t decide to go to that liberal fest of a university last year!,Does this mean they also need to have all there other childhood vaccinations ? Because they should. If you require one it must be all. My two cents.,Looking forward to Biden's new world order where community colleges and trade schools teach the masses.,looks like the Quad would be a good place to socially distance on nice days,I am willing to pursue a course.,The U of I has done an outstanding job compared to most universities. Proud of them!,Stay save::: UIUC.....::: go....,Am ready to fund some students,Scott Barr::: why didn’t you go to a different school if Illinois and Champaign are such a joke?

Future Illini::: in case you need some convincing::: here are a few reasons you should #ChooseIllinois.  🧡 We have 1:::800+ student clubs & orgs 💙 We have 30+ support and cultural centers 🧡 We were voted the #1 Midwest food town 💙 There are half a million alumni around the world,2021-04-28 19:16:36,My husband and I both graduated from UIUC and had a great time there::: made lifelong friends and have gone on to successfully careers. Our oldest child was admitted to class of 2025 but turned down the offer yesterday because UIUC has not stayed competitive with scholarships for top students.

#ILLINOIS students::: there are 2:::000+ COVID-19 vaccine appointments available at CRCE this week. Moderna is available on Tuesday::: and Pfizer is available Wednesday–Friday.  Sign up for an appointment through MyMcKinley ▶️ mymckinley.illinois.edu,2021-04-19 15:44:12,Students cannot get their 2nd dose in their home county if due after they leave campus!! In your MassMail emails you states: “CUPHD is advising that all individuals who are eligible and able take the first opportunity to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. If possible::: you are encouraged to return to the same location for your second dose. But if that is not possible::: the health department in your home county should be able to schedule and administer your second dose if you contact them and explain your situation. Be sure to have your vaccine record card when you contact them.” CUPHD is incorrect!! UIUC shouldn’t be writing this. I just called DUPage County Health Dept. They cannot schedule 2nd doses. Please update your communications to students and families. McKinley and other CU local vaccine providers should be giving informed consent that students MUST return to the same location for their 2nd dose or wait to go to a location in their home community to be vaccinated. I’m aghast that UIUC is giving students inaccurate information.,Why aren’t you automatically scheduling the 2nd shot like many places do?,Good job::: UIUC.,Katie Kauffman!!,Molly Marie 😁,I’ll keep the blood clots outta my system::: no thanks,Hello to you all i just want to say a litle testimony about this powerful man Dr Abula who helped me in my relationship problem .

No matter the decade::: Green Street has always been at the heart of campustown. 🔸🔹  Illini have found their favorite restaurants & bars::: bookstores::: record shops::: apartments::: theaters and more here.  What is your favorite Green Street era? 👇🏽,2021-04-02 16:17:47,Early 70s had a lot of personality::: IMO. Deluxe::: 2nd Chance::: Murphy's::: Bailey & Hines::: and around the corner was Whitt's End and Poppa Dels.,Spent a lot of time there in the late 60s.,My favorite era? Any era where the CHIEF was around!,Mid to late 1970s was my era! One spring we had so much rain that the intersection of Fourth and Green Street flooded.,Green Street has lost nearly all of its quaintness and local flavor. Champaign used to have one of the best campus towns anywhere and now it just looks like any big city street full of high-rises::: chains::: and an Asian restaurant every 40 steps. (BTW::: I love all kinds of Asian food::: but enough is enough). Clearly::: there are still awesome stops along the way and a few representing yesteryear like Murphy’s::: but it is so sad to lose the local flavor and independent businesses. Obviously::: there are some great new businesses as well::: and thoughtful change can be good. Nothing can stay the same forever::: but progress does not mean that you have to wipe the slate clean either.,I will never forget seeing “Rocky” at the Co-Ed. At the end of the film the audience stood up and applauded.,Green Street was a destination for me in the 1970’s. By the 1980’s::: I spent time there for reasons other than partying.,Green Street is just one big shopping mall::: it's not what it used to be back in the 1980s when we had Zorbas::: independent bookstores::: quaint studio apartments. Every time I come back to visit it gets worse and worse with all those high rises. I hate it now.,Wow! I know Champaign-Urban a during my span there from 2000-2004; the Math Building looks exactly the same as it did back in the ‘20s. Great school and I feel blessed to have gone there,Had lots of fun times in Campustown during the 80’s::: still have albums bought at Record Service! Not loving how the high rises seem to have taken over though.....,"Two incredible memories from the Co-Ed theater. Front row for ""Dirty Harry"" and ""Animal House"" with a group attending a wedding.",I'm not anti-change::: but the change over the last 20 years just homogenized the look of everything and took away the character of campustown.,Interesting that the 70s have no photo. Maybe the demonstrations in the spring of 1970 were too much. I remember seeing Woodstock at the movie theater on Green St.,I was there 2006-2010. Green Street was THE place to be on weekends or really any day of the week. Kams::: Firehouse::: Clybourne::: White Horse::: Murphys::: Joes::: and all the great late night eats. My mom was there in the late 60s and early 70s during the protests::: but even then Green Street seemed like lots of fun. Looks like garbage now.,80's and a slice of pepperoni pizza from Garcia's!,My main memory is mid 60s protest with police on top of then 2 story buildings::: with loud roar “Jump::: jump”,Was a grad student from 1974-1978. Fond memories of Murphy's::: DeLuxe Lunch,With all the high-rise construction::: Campus Town has lost its charm!,Certainly not today’s! I’d take the 1920s version over what’s there now.,The places I remember are Kams::: Bidwells::: The Thunderbird and Po' Boys. That was in the 60's.,4 H House-our first date 65 years ago !,80's/90's were some of the best times ever.,‘73 - ‘80::: Zorba’s::: Bubby and Zadie’s::: Eddie’s A-1 deli::: Abe’s Red Hots::: Garcia’s pizza. Those were the days!,1980 when I went there for 🏕 printing camp,You skipped my favorite era...the 70s! Green Street is unrecognizable today.,When Tyke and the Red Lion ruled the music scene. mid-'60's to the early '70's.,Zorba's::: gyros::: basket of fries and pitcher of beer🍺 Also::: Vitamin C Night at White Horse.,If you haven't gotten noodles at Bangkok Thai you haven't lived!!,No Sixties. Turk's Head::: Deluxe Lunch and Cue with the famous fish sandwich.,There's a hole on my heart where The Turks Head used to be.,Bubby and Zadie's::: Deluxe Lunch::: and Coed Theatres....72 - 78.....Abe's Red Hots::: Ruby Gulch::: Red Lion::: White Horse......and of course::: Murphy's Pub.....,Goodbye small local businesses::: welcome corporate overlords!,75 to 79 were my years and have many fond memories of the establishments there. I went back in 2002 to interview graduating students and could only find a handful of the places I used to visit as a student.,83-87! Halloween!!,I miss the movie theater that was on green street.,What happened to the 60’s and 70’s?,T-Bird::: Treno’s::: Boni’s::: Cochran’s::: White Horse Inn::: Panama Reds::: Alley Cat. Late 70’s::: early 80’s.,Quarter beers at O’Malley’s and American Pie,Major changes. Thank you for sharing.

It was a fun season! 🧡💙🧡💙,Thanks for a GREAT SEASON! So PROUD of all of you!,You made us proud!!! 🧡🧡🏀🏀💙💙,Love these guys. Thanks for helping us with many thrills and joys during the pandemic,Thank you for a really fun season::: Illini! I am probably as sad as you for the outcome today::: but you have nothing to be ashamed of..we are so grateful and so proud of all of you 🧡💙,Big Ten Tournament Champs!!! Fantastic season men!! I enjoyed all your games cuz you all played like a family team-\-\- happy to be playing ball together. SO entertaining to watch. Fun personalities and quality individual young men. Good luck in you future endeavors Ago & Kofi and all the other senior Illini players. Go forth and do great things. Be kind. Be happy. We love you!! To returning Fighting Illini of Illinois... GO Illini::: GO!!! ((::,Thanks for a wonderful season! I'd love to see Kofi return for another year (hint::: hint),I agree! Proud of all of you!,You boys did not disappoint me at all this season! I thoroughly enjoyed watching you guys and I'm pretty sure my son will get over the fact that 'Belo was my fave U of I student this year. Cheering for Loyola to take it all the way now.,A wonderful season with a hard working team. Not the result we wanted but you should be proud of all you accomplished.,Thank you all for an incredible season::: and best wishes to the seniors on the team.,I still feel the IllinI had one of the 2 (?4) best teams in the tournament::: but (sadly) not today::: when they were clearly outplayed in seemingly every category. Have thoroughly enjoyed the season otherwise::: and will always be loyal to the Orange and Blue Fighting IllinI.,This team clicked with each other...so fun to watch ....loved how they shared the ball and kept reaching out to each other... They made us proud to be Illini fans ... Thanks to all and wish Ayo and Kofi the best in the NBA. Already looking forward to next season... Thanks Coach and entire staff for producing a great team...All of you worked hard in this Covid atmosphere.,They played a great game and through it all remained winners .,I’ve really enjoyed this year. Your a great team illini,You have helped turn around our basketball program. Thank you for your work this season .. I look forward to the seasons to come with optimism::: thanks to you.  Today is heartbreaking::: and I am sure you are down. Take a moment to feel bad... then put it behind you and bring on next year! There is reason to be optimistic! I would love to see us put together a 20-year run into the tournament and got deep a few of those along the way (would be really nice to win one of those!! :-)). This year's team is the start of that streak!  Best of luck to the seniors and those that will choose to move to other pastures -\-\ I look forward to supporting those that will make 2021-22 even better!  Go ILLINo1S!!,Today was frustrating and yes::: Moser seemed to out coach us today. But there was nothing embarrassing about it. Our young men lost a game. The kids and coaches are something for us to be proud of::: even if they lost today.,So proud of these young men. I am heartbroken and I'm sure they are too. The season has been so much fun to watch. We will miss Ayo::: but will have a great group back. Go Illini We love you.,This team gave us a lot of enjoyment this winter! Thank you!,Never missed a game and loved watching this team play! It really was a great season for Illini fans!,You all tried hard you’re an incrediable group of players,Thanks for the exciting season. Some unfinished business to prepare for.,Thanks to coach Brad and the whole team for an Awesome season::: hopefully we will take it all next season.,"I am well beyond disappointed::: but I am not surprised. The team deserved a better finish than this. The Illini Nation deserved a better finish than this. We have to face the reality that we have a coaching problem. You cannot have this much talent and potential and not be able to demonstrate decent fundamental basketball and sustained improvement through the season. Loyola played a very consistent::: even-paced::: controlled::: and fundamental game::: and as such::: they dismantled us. I do not want to take anything away from their solid performance::: but they are not world-killers by any means. We just made them look as if they are. All season long I have been a broken record about our inconsistency and lack of real improvement::: and even how our ‘great wins’ have not demonstrated any sustainability or focused offense. “Terrible shot selection.” “Out-of-control play.” “Not protecting the ball.” “No ability to set an offense.” “Not using the inside/ outside game to our advantage.” Early in the season you expect mistakes and a learning curve::: but Underwood never got any of this under control all season long. Sure::: when Michigan had one of their worst home games in a decade::: and Illinois shot the lights out::: we immediately forgot the fact that we still did not run an offense all night. All we could say is that crushed the #2 team in the land. Really? Go back and watch our ‘great wins’ and tell me that we were playing good::: hard-nose fundamental basketball. Yes::: there were certainly moments::: but then we would fall right back into our out-of-control play and that sickening and lackadaisical ‘around the top of the key’ crap that we call passing and dribbling. I am so tired of seeing those telegraphed-passes and half-hearted picks until time runs short::: and then we go right back to school-lot antics with contortioned and off-balance shots. This team had as much talent as any Illinois team in history::: and the coaching staff failed them by not getting them to play to their potential. As for next year::: I’ll watch every game and cheer for our Illini through thick and thin::: but as Albert Einstein is credited with saying::: ""The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result.""",Be nice to see Ayo and Kofi come back and try it again.,Still champs in my heart! Great season Illini!,They were all flat-footed today. Looked tired like they were up partying all night. So embarrassed! They are better than this!,Great run. That’s why they call it March madness. Coach Underwood got us back to the dance and won a Big Ten title.,We have enjoyed watching the Illini games this season. We were so disappointed in the game yesterday but know know the players are disappointed as well. This is our favorite team. Best wishes to Ayo as we will miss him.,Brad Underwood deserves some personal hardware and accolades after this season. Thanks for sticking with us these past 4 years. You Rock big time::: Coach!! I am grateful for the hard work you and your staff and players put forth this magical season. Looking forward to more Illini basketball... In the years to come!! ((::,Loyola came with a plan and executed brilliantly. Illinois was not able to change how the game was being played,Illini did not play well today! Gotta love Hoosier Catholic-style win.,Such a talented bunch! March Madness is tough. I wish the team all the best in the future.,I hope they stay together and return next year. This will make them hungry to go deeper.,Busted my bracket guys! Sorry about the loss.....,Choked...got out coached::: out played::: dominated::: embarrassed::: exposed::: etc. Should have stayed back in Illinois so they would not be exposed as a fraud. Hire Moser as your HC he’s 1 million times the coach Underwood is...,Moser exposed Underwood's reliance on the pick and roll at the top of the key and challenged his stubbornness to make adjustments... reminds me of Matt Nagy when the going gets rough just pretend it's not rough and don't make adjustments,Ayo and co helped change culture and expectations that lets Illinois fans feel good about next year and beyond.,You should be proud of yourselves::: you have shown great teamwork and we enjoyed every game! Great Season! 👍,I said 2 weeks ago that if Illinois lost focus they would lose and they did. Totally pathetic and embarrassing performance. Illinois-phooey -along with Purdue::: Ohio State and Michigan State. Big Ten should be renamed the big chokers.,Love the team and love the coach. The fair weather fans are crying and doing their usual arm chair coaching. But I am proud to call every one of the players a fellow Illini.,What a day to play your worst game of the season. So sad::: they really had the potential to go all the way. Thanks for a great season!,Most overhyped college basketball program smh 🤦‍♂️,Every day but today. I’ll feel way better about this season tomorrow.,Agreed! Go Ramblers!,Thanks for a great season and making the game so fun to watch.,I guess don't need to watch the recorded game then?,Ayo and Kofi will get eaten alive in the nba,So proud of these young men. I am heartbroken and I'm sure they are too. The season has been so much fun to watch. We will miss Ayo tremendously! We will have a great group back and hope Kofi will return. We will always be ILLINI fans!!! Love this team!🧡💙🏀,Biggest Fan!! Established Since 1989 & Beyond ‼,They’ll always be a bunch of LOSERS.

Hey Fighting Illini Basketball::: we're cheering you on from home. 🧡  Time to dance.,2021-03-19 16:24:59,With a little time to reflect::: congrats to Loyola on an absolutely brilliant game plan and execution. I hope you summon that much focus on the subsequent tournament games.  I am not going to try to diagnose Illinois' systemic failure to execute today. What I will say::: instead::: is that Illinois fans are loyal::: patient::: and appreciative.  We owe so much gratitude to this team. First off::: to Ayo::: his choice to return with his focus::: passion::: humility::: leadership::: and drive has done more to solidify Underwood's offense into the DNA of Illinois Basketball than we would have achieved without his return. The #2 AP ranking and winning the big ten tournament are huge accomplishments .  To Kofi::: he chose to come back too. His contributions in the paint::: rebounding::: scoring::: etc. were instrumental to the character of this squad. I HOPE::: he returned next year. There are things he can learn before going pro::: but time will tell.  Trent and DaMonte held faithfully to Underwood's program while is struggled to get started. Both of them have accepted many different roles with enthusiasm and have played the hearts out for the Illini.  To the whole team::: they played every single game this season. They worked hard to stay healthy and completely avoided the pandemic in the halls of the basketball program. This came at great sacrifice of personal freedoms afforded to even fellow college students during a pandemic. This has been a long::: grueling season::: and Illinois has performed at the best of the abilities for the vast majority of the season.  The guys seemed tired today. After this year::: all that they've done::: already being in Indy a full week longer than the rest of the NCAA….perhaps that was just enough for these kids.  Thank you Fighting Illini Basketball!,I so love our students! Go Illini!,Go go go Illini.....,Thanks Everyone for your hard work.

#ILLINOIS researchers are helping reduce food waste on campus.  A new study found that shifting from round to oval plates with a smaller surface area can significantly reduce food waste in dining halls.  ACES.ILLINOIS.EDU Smaller plates help reduce food waste in campus dining halls,2021-03-11 16:03:54,Food waste is not only correlated with taking too much: it can be highly correlated with the quality or taste of the food being so poor that the student simply refuses to eat it. It would be interesting to ask diners if they enjoyed what they had taken as opposed to only measuring what they threw out. I have seen other colleges take a similar approach::: first starting with removing trays under the guise that it reduces food waste::: now shrinking the size of plates in order to reduce food waste::: but I have yet to seen a study which looks at improving the quality and taste of cafeteria food for students.,Need to cut down::: on all the trash::: from the take home containers.,That and not taking a backpack full of popcorn shrimp out of the cafeteria,Nah::: I cleaned my plate no matter how big or small it was.

As healthcare workers::: Carle Illinois College of Medicine students are among the first to receive both doses of the COVID-19 vaccine.  Their clinical studies call them to be on the frontlines of healthcare::: and each has a deeply personal reason why the vaccine was important to them. Read their stories. 🔽  MEDICINE.ILLINOIS.EDU Carle Illinois students among first to receive both doses of COVID-19 vaccine - Carle Illinois College of Medicine,2021-02-17 17:32:35,I got my first Pfizer vaccination through Carle and they did a great job.,you will know the consequences soon !!!!.... gene therapy COVID19 .!!!,“I want to share my experience with the vaccine – if there were any adverse effects to my blood sugar::: etc. Spoiler alert: there haven’t been any changes:::” Lowe said.,"1. Recognize your condition:  God's commandments prove that we have broken His law.  God says: ""Thou shalt not bear false witness..."" ""Thou shalt not steal."" ""Thou shalt not commit adultery."" ""Thou shalt not covet..."" ""Thou shalt have no other gods before me."" ""Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in Vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain."" The truth is::: if God judged you by His Commandments::: He would find you guilty. Romans 3:19::: AV: ""...that every mouth may be stopped::: and all the world may become guilty before God."" Romans 3:23::: AV: ""For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.""  2. Realize that the price/penalty of sin is death and hell.  Romans 6:23::: AV: ""For the wages of sin is death..."" Revelation 20:15::: AV: ""And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire."" Hell is a real place::: where those who die without accepting The Lord Jesus Christ will go for all eternity.  3. Realize that The Lord Jesus Christ paid your sin debt.  Romans 5:6:::8::: AV: ""For when we were yet without strength::: in due time Christ died for the ungodly."" ""But God commendeth his love toward us::: in that::: while we were yet sinners::: Christ died for us."" The Lord Jesus Christ::: the Son of God::: suffered and died on the cross for your sins. John 3:16::: AV: ""For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son::: that whosoever believeth in him should not perish::: but have everlasting life."" The Lord Jesus Christ loves you. He wants you to be saved and live in Heaven with Him for all eternity.  4. Receive The Lord Jesus Christ as your Saviour.  John 1:12::: AV: ""But as many as received him::: to them gave he power to become the sons of God::: even to them that believe on his name."" In faith::: trust the Lord Jesus as your Saviour today. Acts 16:30-31::: AV: ""...Sirs::: what must I do to be saved? And they said::: Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ::: and thou shalt be saved..."" John 5:24::: AV: ""Verily::: verily::: I say unto you::: He that heareth my word::: and believeth on him that sent me::: hath everlasting life::: and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.""  Would you like to know for sure that Heaven will be your home?  Do you admit that you are a sinner and deserve hell for your sins?  Do you believe that The Lord Jesus Christ died to pay your sin debt?  Will you repent and ask The Lord Jesus Christ to save you today::: right now?  Ephesians 2:8-9::: AV: ""For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works::: lest any man should boast.""  Romans 10:9:::13::: AV: ""That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus::: and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead::: thou shalt be saved."" "" For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.""",Why did they receive it before ill seniors?,Anant Naik,Awesome!,If you are interested to learn about Illuminati come visit our page to check out the online courses offers will end soon. https:// www.facebook.com /POTUSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To say we were completely shocked and devastated when we heard the diagnosis would be an understatement::: given the fact I had home cooked her food for almost her entire life::: she was always at an ideal weight::: she had the vet routinely clean her teeth and we walked both our Labradoodles throughout their entire lives so they were both very active. On August 24::: 2017 renowned Veterinarian Dr Joi Sutton::: DVM::: and column writer for ADW wrote the following::: ""Diabetic dogs become type 1 diabetic after an episode::: or several episodes::: of pancreatitis."" That was suddenly a light bulb moment for me and explained clearly what caused Morgan to become a type 1 diabetic. When Morgan was just 3 years old::: she suddenly developed ""pancreatitis"" and was deathly sick. She required 24 hour care in the hospital for almost a week and nearly died. Morgan was so sick her eyes were bulging. 1 year later::: at the exact time of the year as the year before::: Morgan once again suddenly developed “pancreatitis” requiring 24 hour round the clock care because she was deathly sick again with the exact symptoms as the year before and almost died again. The second time she suddenly developed “pancreatitis:::” the two Vets told us Morgan must of developed pancreatitis because we must be feeding her a high fat diet. Both years I informed the Vets Morgan was on a low fat diet and that I knew that because I was home cooking her food using only 99% fat free ground turkey. Long story short::: it was the “unnecessary” and harmful multiple vaccines the Vets were giving Morgan EVERY year::: also referred to as “over vaccinating” that caused Morgan to have a “severe adverse reaction""::: which in turn::: caused the “pancreatitis” both years. And I am the person who figured out the over-vaccinatin g with unnecessary multiple vaccines the Vets were giving Morgan “EVERY year” caused Morgan to have both of those severe adverse reactions::: become deathly sick::: nearly die and develop “pancreatitis” and it was NOT the food I was making her. Because Morgan became sick 2 days “after” the Vets gave her the unnecessary multiple vaccines:::(inste ad of the day of)::: the Vets did not make the connection. A “severe adverse reaction” from the Vet over-vaccinatin g your dog can happen “immediately:::” “within minutes”::: “within hours”::: “within days”::: within weeks::: and up to “2 months” after being injected with a vaccine or vaccines. According to one Renowned Homeopathic Veterinarian::: “Vaccinosis ” in dogs is the irreversible damage that is done to a dog from {unknowingly allowing the Vet to over-vaccinate your dog}. Vaccinosis in dogs can develop months to years AFTER the vaccines are given. In Morgan’s case::: Vaccinosis caused Morgan to develop “type 1 diabetes.” I figured out what made Morgan deathly sick because I looked at my 2 previous yearly calendars for both those years and saw it in black and white. If the two Vets would of looked at Morgan's medical records more closely::: they would of seen the same thing I saw. My research shows that when a dog is “over-vaccinate d”::: meaning::: unknowingly allowing the Vet to give your dog a vaccine or vaccines every year::: whether they need it or not”::: it can cause a ""severe adverse reaction"" and that severe adverse reaction is referred to by Vets as “Vaccinosis”::: which in turn can cause “pancreatitis"" and many other serious illnesses and chronic diseases. Morgan’s diagnosis of “type 1 diabetes” required us to give her an insulin injection every 12 hours. The “pancreatitis” Morgan developed two years in a row was caused from the Vets giving her unnecessary and multiple vaccines every year::: whether she needed them or not and not doing a titer blood test first to see if Morgan actually needed additional vaccines.” I recently was informed that Veterinarians across the country were warned about the dangers of over-vaccinatin g dogs many years ago in all the Veterinary Medical Journals but they chose to ignore the warnings. When you unknowingly allow the Vet to over-vaccinate your dog::: it “weakens their immune system” and it overstimulates their pancreas and that can cause your dog to become a diabetic and cause other serious autoimmune diseases::: allergies::: cancer and Vaccinosis. According to many renowned Veterinarians::: Vaccinosis is irreversible. Lesson to be learned here is to tell your Vet to do a “titer blood test” before any additional vaccines are given to see if your dog really needs any additional vaccines. Many renowned Veterinarians are saying once a puppy has received all their puppy vaccinations::: they are protected for life and that they should have a “titer blood test” before any additional vaccines are given. A “titer blood test” is a blood test that shows if your dog is still protected with immunity and has measurable circulating antibodies from previous vaccines to determine if additional vaccines are really needed that year. It is imperative that if your dog has a severe adverse reaction to a vaccine that YOU report it to the “USDA.” We now have an epidemic of dogs with allergies::: autoimmune diseases::: diabetes::: cancer and Vaccinosis from Vets over-vaccinatin g dogs on a massive scale. This epidemic is also a global problem. Only after Morgan nearly died 2 years in a row and we spent thousands of dollars each year to save Morgan’s life did the Vets THEN suggest we have a “titer blood test” done on Morgan. Come to find out the Vets were giving Morgan a “rabie vaccine” EVERY year::: a “parvo vaccine” EVERY year and a “distemper vaccine” EVERY year::: all at the same time::: without doing a titer blood test first to see if any of those vaccines were even necessary. One Renowned Integrative Veterinarian refers to this as “Legalized Malpractice.” Always ask for a “titer blood test” to test for measurable circulating antibodies before any additional vaccines are given. If your dog has any medical conditions and is considered an unhealthy pet or is a senior dog::: they qualify for a “medical exemption waiver.” On every vial of a vaccine it reads: “For Healthy Pets Only.” I have joined the Facebook groups “Joey’s Legacy-VetMal Victims” and “Protect The Pets.” I wish I knew 15 years ago what I know now. Greed wins out over their oath to “Do No Harm.” We “now” recognize that we trusted those who did NOT deserve our trust. And to think::: I figured out what 2 licensed Veterinarians with medical degrees could not! We blame the two Vets::: both co-owners at the Veterinary practice for Morgan’s suffering and demise. We had to say goodbye to our beloved Labradoodle Morgan 289 days ago::: on March 27::: 2020. To say we are completely devastated would be an understatement.  Morgan was the love of our lives. Losing a pet is an inconsolable pain. A face we can no longer touch::: of a fur baby we loved so very much! Morgan’s super power was her sweet and affectionate personality. Every time we came home and walked in the door she acted like she hadn’t seen us in 20 years. We could walk into any room and know where Morgan was because her tail began wagging. We will miss Morgan dearly. Our memories of our times together are very special to us and we hold them very close to our hearts. We are comforted in knowing Morgan is now with our other beloved Labradoodle Montecore::: ( Morgan’s best friend ). When it was time to say goodbye to Morgan::: we held Morgan::: we told her what she has meant to us::: we told her we loved her very much and that we will always love her and the last thing Morgan saw was us! It is not goodbye Morgan::: it is until we meet again. ❤️🐾 The emotional distress that I feel will be lifelong; sometimes overwhelming.

Ruff week. At least it's finally #IlliniFridays.  📸: @katethegreatpyr,2021-01-08 20:37:03,We had the same idea but the hat wouldn’t stay up! Ha!,CorgILLINI,Brian Kelly,Ruff. Ha Ha. Love it!!,Kate looks so huggable.,Cute 🧡💙🐾,Alice Fan Bronco should be showing his Illini Pride in the snow 🔷🔶❄️🔶🔷,Olivia Pennebaker,Em Bee sho cute,Miriam,Kelly Veach,Sandy Dennis Bragelman thank you for sharing this; I am SO sorry for all that you went through::: and the loss of your beautiful Morgan 💝,Did you know about cash app flip message me for your cash app blessings now,"MORGAN’S STORY Our beloved 9 yr old Labradoodle Morgan was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes on November 10::: 2016. To say we were completely shocked and devastated when we heard the diagnosis would be an understatement::: given the fact I had home cooked her food for almost her entire life::: she was always at an ideal weight::: she had the vet routinely clean her teeth and we walked both our Labradoodles throughout their entire lives so they were both very active. On August 24::: 2017 renowned Veterinarian Dr Joi Sutton::: DVM::: and column writer for ADW wrote the following::: ""Diabetic dogs become type 1 diabetic after an episode::: or several episodes::: of pancreatitis."" That was suddenly a light bulb moment for me and explained clearly what caused Morgan to become a type 1 diabetic. When Morgan was just 3 years old::: she suddenly developed ""pancreatitis"" and was deathly sick. She required 24 hour care in the hospital for almost a week and nearly died. Morgan was so sick her eyes were bulging. 1 year later::: at the exact time of the year as the year before::: Morgan once again suddenly developed “pancreatitis” requiring 24 hour round the clock care because she was deathly sick again with the exact symptoms as the year before and almost died again. The second time she suddenly developed “pancreatitis:::” the two Vets told us Morgan must of developed pancreatitis because we must be feeding her a high fat diet. Both years I informed the Vets Morgan was on a low fat diet and that I knew that because I was home cooking her food using only 99% fat free ground turkey. Long story short::: it was the “unnecessary” and harmful multiple vaccines the Vets were giving Morgan EVERY year::: also referred to as “over vaccinating” that caused Morgan to have a “severe adverse reaction""::: which in turn::: caused the “pancreatitis” both years. And I am the person who figured out the over-vaccinatin g with unnecessary multiple vaccines the Vets were giving Morgan “EVERY year” caused Morgan to have both of those severe adverse reactions::: become deathly sick::: nearly die and develop “pancreatitis” and it was NOT the food I was making her. Because Morgan became sick 2 days “after” the Vets gave her the unnecessary multiple vaccines:::(inste ad of the day of)::: the Vets did not make the connection. A “severe adverse reaction” from the Vet over-vaccinatin g your dog can happen “immediately:::” “within minutes”::: “within hours”::: “within days”::: within weeks::: and up to “2 months” after being injected with a vaccine or vaccines. According to one Renowned Homeopathic Veterinarian::: “Vaccinosis ” in dogs is the irreversible damage that is done to a dog from {unknowingly allowing the Vet to over-vaccinate your dog}. Vaccinosis in dogs can develop months to years AFTER the vaccines are given. In Morgan’s case::: Vaccinosis caused Morgan to develop “type 1 diabetes.” I figured out what made Morgan deathly sick because I looked at my 2 previous yearly calendars for both those years and saw it in black and white. If the two Vets would of looked at Morgan's medical records more closely::: they would of seen the same thing I saw. My research shows that when a dog is “over-vaccinate d”::: meaning::: unknowingly allowing the Vet to give your dog a vaccine or vaccines every year::: whether they need it or not”::: it can cause a ""severe adverse reaction"" and that severe adverse reaction is referred to by Vets as “Vaccinosis”::: which in turn can cause “pancreatitis"" and many other serious illnesses and chronic diseases. Morgan’s diagnosis of “type 1 diabetes” required us to give her an insulin injection every 12 hours. The “pancreatitis” Morgan developed two years in a row was caused from the Vets giving her unnecessary and multiple vaccines every year::: whether she needed them or not and not doing a titer blood test first to see if Morgan actually needed additional vaccines.” I recently was informed that Veterinarians across the country were warned about the dangers of over-vaccinatin g dogs many years ago in all the Veterinary Medical Journals but they chose to ignore the warnings. When you unknowingly allow the Vet to over-vaccinate your dog::: it “weakens their immune system” and it overstimulates their pancreas and that can cause your dog to become a diabetic and cause other serious autoimmune diseases::: allergies::: cancer and Vaccinosis. According to many renowned Veterinarians::: Vaccinosis is irreversible. Lesson to be learned here is to tell your Vet to do a “titer blood test” before any additional vaccines are given to see if your dog really needs any additional vaccines. Many renowned Veterinarians are saying once a puppy has received all their puppy vaccinations::: they are protected for life and that they should have a “titer blood test” before any additional vaccines are given. A “titer blood test” is a blood test that shows if your dog is still protected with immunity and has measurable circulating antibodies from previous vaccines to determine if additional vaccines are really needed that year. It is imperative that if your dog has a severe adverse reaction to a vaccine that YOU report it to the “USDA.” We now have an epidemic of dogs with allergies::: autoimmune diseases::: diabetes::: cancer and Vaccinosis from Vets over-vaccinatin g dogs on a massive scale. This epidemic is also a global problem. Only after Morgan nearly died 2 years in a row and we spent thousands of dollars each year to save Morgan’s life did the Vets THEN suggest we have a “titer blood test” done on Morgan. Come to find out the Vets were giving Morgan a “rabie vaccine” EVERY year::: a “parvo vaccine” EVERY year and a “distemper vaccine” EVERY year::: all at the same time::: without doing a titer blood test first to see if any of those vaccines were even necessary. One Renowned Integrative Veterinarian refers to this as “Legalized Malpractice.” Always ask for a “titer blood test” to test for measurable circulating antibodies before any additional vaccines are given. If your dog has any medical conditions and is considered an unhealthy pet or is a senior dog::: they qualify for a “medical exemption waiver.” On every vial of a vaccine it reads: “For Healthy Pets Only.” I have joined the Facebook groups “Joey’s Legacy-VetMal Victims” and “Protect The Pets.” I wish I knew 15 years ago what I know now. Greed wins out over their oath to “Do No Harm.” We “now” recognize that we trusted those who did NOT deserve our trust. And to think::: I figured out what 2 licensed Veterinarians with medical degrees could not! We blame the two Vets::: both co-owners at the Veterinary practice for Morgan’s suffering and demise. We had to say goodbye to our beloved Labradoodle Morgan 289 days ago::: on March 27::: 2020. To say we are completely devastated would be an understatement.  Morgan was the love of our lives. Losing a pet is an inconsolable pain. A face we can no longer touch::: of a fur baby we loved so very much! Morgan’s super power was her sweet and affectionate personality. Every time we came home and walked in the door she acted like she hadn’t seen us in 20 years. We could walk into any room and know where Morgan was because her tail began wagging. We will miss Morgan dearly. Our memories of our times together are very special to us and we hold them very close to our hearts. We are comforted in knowing Morgan is now with our other beloved Labradoodle Montecore::: ( Morgan’s best friend ). When it was time to say goodbye to Morgan::: we held Morgan::: we told her what she has meant to us::: we told her we loved her very much and that we will always love her and the last thing Morgan saw was us! It is not goodbye Morgan::: it is until we meet again. ❤️🐾 The emotional distress that I feel will be lifelong; sometimes overwhelming. Sharing “Morgan’s Story” is a part of closure for me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NEWS.ILLINOIS.EDU Disposable surgical masks best for being heard clearly when speaking::: study finds,2021-01-05 16:05:32,And how badly mumblers are unable to project or articulate. Having had speech comm classes in college::: clarity is often more important than volume::: so additional “muffling” is a problem for all with poor speech habits.,I agree::: being a teacher::: my students can hear me the best when I wear the disposable hospital masks and not the cloth masks. I wear those on test days or activity days when I don’t talk as much.,OK but then get them in stores so that we can buy them!!!!  When things are not available to purchase::: then it makes it very hard for us to do what we should!,Interesting but expensive. Why not research how one can make reusable masks; i.e.::: what fabrics can be used that provide safety and better communications,I would love to visit this anechoic chamber when my son graduates from U of I in the spring/summer 🎶❤️,Would be great for teachers !,Wow what a completely idiotic waste of time and resources,"Yes it is hard to hear.

Nice,Perhaps research infant and child development with all of this mask wearing too. Children must watch faces talking and expressing emotions to learn interactions and to know how to get attention to get what they need. Facial recognition and emoting and interaction is absolutely crucial during certain phases of child development.  How are they learning and expressing with all of this mask wearing going on? Now are all strangers more scary because they are masked? Now is it not okay to interact because that person is not showing emotion because they are wearing a mask? Why are Mom and Dad covering their faces up when other people are around? I am sure there will be young children negatively impacted by this and perhaps it will have long term affects. THIS is what I would worry about and THIS is just one reason why masks should not be a long term solution-it has already been almost a year.,Noted. So let’s talk less::: and save the environment.

Check out the complete guide to applying to #ILLINOIS. 👇🏼  BLOG.ADMISSIONS.ILLINOIS.EDU Applying to the University of Illinois: A Complete Guide,2020-12-28 21:13:00,"Přítomnost.cz | Czech political-cultu ral internet review founded in 1924 GLOSS Presence Today we produce practically anything. But what of who has? IVAN STRÁNSKÝ ELECTRICAL DESIGNER AND PATENT HOLDER We are all on the threshold of a new age hastened by a viral infection. It is only a matter of cost::: how long it will realistically affect our lives and our perceptions. (Fools are the ones who don't realize it.) From the point of view of perception technology::: it is now possible to elegantly create artificial reality with everything that goes with it. So far::: this is used::: for example::: by top athletes::: such as Eva Samková and Ester Ledecká. This type of trainer allows you to train downhill or slalom exactly as the named ones experience on a real piste. Of course::: you can argue that this is nothing new::: we have trainers for pilots of large aircraft here for many years. But there is a ""small"" difference. Flight simulators can and could be afforded by a large production or aviation group such as Boeing or CSA. Today::: however::: the costs of these systems have fallen by an order of magnitude and their implementation is proceeding on a slightly different basis. Today::: it is not a problem to produce practically anything::: completely without the participation of human power. The only limiting parameter is the financial complexity. Yet. The production of means to enable this has a declining cost over time. The moment when the scale flips to the side of complex automation is very close. Have you never seen an automated factory? You don't have to go all the way to Japan::: similar devices can be seen not only on television::: but also::: for example::: in the paint shop of the Mladá Boleslav car plant or::: for example::: in the former Cutisin company in the Krkonoše foothills. They are not alone::: time will force it very soon. Slots are able not only to play chess::: for example::: but also to paint pictures according to the designs of old masters. Programs for three-dimension al printers will print an exact copy of not only the statue of David::: but also complex buildings as a model. Yes::: the machine will even build this house for you::: without a single bricklayer. So far relatively expensive. Relatively::: in terms of time. There is a huge space in the market system in the field of porn. The equipment::: which you will soon buy at a price that will not ruin you::: will create a fictional reality at home::: where a beauty will work that you would not get in a brothel or elsewhere by chance. You can even program this lady::: who seems real to you::: to choose her behavior to suit you at certain moments. The end of public houses? That is a question. Rather::: in my opinion::: there is a risk that users::: of whom there will be millions::: will become so dependent on similar techniques that they will reject the raw reality. Of course::: I omit the control of a number of other functions through information and communication systems in the manner of Elon Musk. There you can develop promotional events such as ""you get benefits::: connect with us::: you will be better"". Who do you think will win? I will say: He who will be farthest. Of course::: China has the biggest ""budget""::: ie finance. It doesn't matter at all who will be president in the United States. It does not matter at all who will be the Prime Minister of the Czech Republic (as far as our republic is concerned::: let's face it::: they are still psychopaths::: as experts on the human psyche claim). What matters is what pays off and where is the profit. The others are babysitters who call::: for example::: on the radio and say: ""Play Miluška::: a friend from Kolín."" Both the callers and those who arrange it at those stations will soon be out of work::: write it down. *** My profession is to be able to devise any system that would meet the wishes of the client in terms of production.

(217) 332-1882,2020-12-11 00:00:00,"ARE YOU UNKNOWINGLY ALLOWING THE VETERINARIAN TO OVER VACCINATE YOUR DOG? “ASK YOUR VETERINARIAN IF TYPE 1 DIABETES IS RIGHT FOR YOUR DOG!”  MORGAN’S STORY Our beloved 9 yr old Labradoodle Morgan was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes on November 10::: 2016. To say we were completely shocked and devastated when we heard the diagnosis would be an understatement::: given the fact I had home cooked her food for almost her entire life::: she was always at an ideal weight::: she had the vet routinely clean her teeth and we walked both our Labradoodles throughout their entire lives so they were both very active. On August 24::: 2017 renowned Veterinarian Dr Joi Sutton::: DVM::: and column writer for ADW wrote the following::: ""Diabetic dogs become type 1 diabetic after an episode::: or several episodes::: of pancreatitis."" That was suddenly a light bulb moment for me and explained clearly what caused Morgan to become a type 1 diabetic. When Morgan was just 3 years old::: she suddenly developed ""pancreatitis"" and was deathly sick. She required 24 hour care in the hospital for almost a week and nearly died. Morgan was so sick her eyes were bulging. 1 year later::: at the exact time of the year as the year before::: Morgan once again suddenly developed “pancreatitis” requiring 24 hour round the clock care because she was deathly sick again with the exact symptoms as the year before and almost died again. The second time she suddenly developed “pancreatitis:::” the Vets told us Morgan must of developed pancreatitis because we must be feeding her a high fat diet. Both years I informed the Vets Morgan was on a low fat diet and that I knew that because I was home cooking her food using only 99% fat free ground turkey. Long story short::: it was the “unnecessary” and harmful multiple vaccines the Vets were giving Morgan EVERY year::: also referred to as “over vaccinating” that caused Morgan to have a “severe adverse reaction""::: which in turn::: caused the “pancreatitis” both years. And I am the person who figured out the multiple vaccines the vets were giving Morgan EVERY year caused Morgan to have both of those severe adverse reactions::: become deathly sick::: and develop “pancreatitis” and it was NOT the food I was making her. Because Morgan became sick 2 days “after” the Vet gave her the unnecessary and harmful multiple vaccines:::(inste ad of the day of)::: the Vets did not make the connection. A “severe adverse reaction” from the Vet over-vaccinatin g your dog can happen “immediately:::” “within minutes”::: “within hours”::: “within days”::: within weeks::: and up to 2 months after being injected with a vaccine or vaccines. According to one renowned Homeopathic Veterinarian::: “Vaccinosis ” in dogs is the irreversible damage that is done to a dog from {unknowingly allowing the Vet to over-vaccinate your dog}. Vaccinosis in dogs can develop months to years AFTER the vaccines are given. In Morgan’s case::: Vaccinosis caused Morgan to develop type 1 diabetes. I figured out what made Morgan deathly sick because I looked at my 2 previous yearly calendars for both those years and saw it in black and white. If the two Vets would of looked at Morgan's medical records more closely::: they would of seen the same thing I saw. My research shows that when a dog is “over vaccinated”::: meaning::: unknowingly allowing your Vet to give your dog a vaccine or vaccines every year::: whether they need it or not”::: it can cause a ""severe adverse reaction"" and that severe adverse reaction is referred to by Vets as “Vaccinosis”::: which in turn can cause “pancreatitis"" and many other serious illnesses and chronic diseases. Morgan’s diagnosis of type 1 diabetes required us to give her an insulin injection every 12 hours because of the “pancreatitis she developed” from the Veterinarian giving her unnecessary and harmful multiple vaccines every year::: and not doing a titer blood test first to see if Morgan actually needed additional vaccines.” I recently was informed that Veterinarians across the country were warned about the dangers of over vaccinating dogs many years ago in all the Veterinary medical journals but they chose to ignore the warnings. When you unknowingly allow the Vet to over-vaccinate your dog::: it weakens their immune system and it overstimulates their pancreas and that can cause your dog to become a diabetic and cause other serious autoimmune diseases::: allergies::: cancer and Vaccinosis. Lesson to be learned here is to have your Vet do a “titer blood test” before any additional vaccines are given to see if your dog really needs any additional vaccines. Many renowned Veterinarians are saying once a puppy has received all their puppy vaccinations::: they are protected for life and that they should be “titered ” before any additional vaccines are given. A “titer blood test”is a blood test that shows if your dog is still protected with immunity and has measurable circulating antibodies from previous vaccines to determine if additional vaccines are really needed that year. Renowned Integrative Veterinarian Dr John Robb::: DVM::: of “Protect The Pets” will do a rabie titer blood test for $55. They will also do a rabies and core vaccine titer blood test for $80. Contact “Protect The Pets” for more details.  We now have an epidemic of dogs with allergies::: autoimmune diseases::: diabetes::: cancer and Viccinosis from Vets over-vaccinatin g dogs on a massive scale. This epidemic is a global problem now because the vaccine manufacturers are global. For more information on the dangers of unknowingly allowing the vet to over vaccinate your dog::: please google the following renowned Veterinarians like Dr Michael Dym::: DVM::: Dr John Robb::: DVM::: of Protect The Pets::: Dr Charles Loops::: DVM::: Dr Will Falconer::: DVM::: Dr Karen Becker::: DVM::: and Dr Judy Morgan::: DVM::: on their public fb pages and learn more about the dangers of “over vaccinating.” Only after Morgan nearly died 2 years in a roll and we spent thousands of dollars each year to save her life did the Veterinarians THEN suggest we have a “titer blood test” done on Morgan. Come to find out the Veterinarians were giving Morgan a rabie vaccine EVERY year::: a parvo vaccine EVERY year and a distemper vaccine EVERY year::: all at the same time. Knowing what I know now::: that was as one renowned Integrative Veterinarian refers to as “Legalized Malpractice.” Always ask for a “titer blood test” to test for measurable circulating antibodies before any additional vaccines are given. If your dog has any medical condition and is an unhealthy pet or is considered a senior dog::: they qualify for a “medical exemption waiver.” On every vial of vaccines it reads: “For Healthy Pets Only.” I wish I knew 15 years ago what I know now. Greed wins out over their oath to “do no harm.” And to think::: I figured out what 2 licensed Veterinarians with medical degrees could not! We had to say goodbye to our beloved Labradoodle Morgan on March 27::: 2020. Losing a pet is an inconsolable pain. A face we can no longer touch::: of a fur baby we loved so very much! Morgan’s super power was her sweet and affectionate personality. Every time we came home and walked in the door she acted like she hadn’t seen us in 20 years. We could walk into any room and know where Morgan was because her tail began wagging. We will miss Morgan dearly. Our memories of our times together are very special to us and we hold them very close to our hearts. We are comforted in knowing Morgan is now with our other beloved Labradoodle Montecore::: (Morgan’s best friend.) When it was time to say goodbye to Morgan::: we held Morgan::: we told her what she has meant to us::: we told her we loved her very much and that we will always love her and the last thing Morgan saw was us! It is not goodbye Morgan::: it is until we meet again. ❤️🐾",Meredith Jones Rowland 🎄❄️🎅🏻,Finally something to brighten our day in 2020 Thank you for providing this fun program 👍,Was assuming they are music or choir students.

Starting this week::: on-campus COVID-19 testing is shifting to smaller tubes. The change will provide:  + A more efficient::: automated process + Faster lab processing of results + Fewer invalid or inconclusive results + Reduced plastic waste  NEWS.ILLINOIS.EDU Revised process to speed on-campus COVID-19 testing,2020-12-09 19:37:33,Took it today for the first with the straw method with a bunch of people. You will be there 5-15 minutes fighting through all the bubbles. Maybe once we do it a few times the time will decrease. Also::: you will see wet spots on the floor because people tend to miss the straw-like I did.,So happy U of I is working to keep students safe and on campus!,Valentina Ardila,I've spit in the big tube and the small tube through a straw and swabbed my nasal passages. I prefer the nasal passage swab if they could speed up the results -\-\ so tired of trying to imagine food porn to encourage saliva production...,It took almost 24 hours to get my results back. I would get my results in 8 hours or less before.,Continuous improvement culture. 🧡💙🧡💙,This new method is unsanitary and unnecessarily difficult. Spit all over my hands because the diameter of the tube is 10 times smaller than the original. Bubbles overflow from the shorter tube::: getting to 2.5 ml takes much::: much longer. Extremely bad decision made by U of I all for the sake of money while students are taking online classes paying FULL PRICE TUITION. No wonder wait times are longer::: this new change is terrible.,Olivia Ingold,I tested yesterday. Using a straw to put saliva in smaller tube is very problematic for many I watched. It does not drain through straw into smaller sample tube. You must slightly blow air into straw to push saliva into sample tube. I watched people blowing too hard into straw causing saliva to hit tube bottom and fly out in all directions. It must be enough of a problem that there is a person with a swiffer and spray going around cleaning the saliva off floor. Plus the huge open top boxes containing biohazard bags scattered around the floor that we have to throw the used straws into. Great chance to pick up a little CVOID-19 while taking required tests.,I can’t wait to see this process brought to market: http:// links.illinois.e du/f/a/ NdbDGG6s30QSegbD Lu4odg~~/ AAMFlAA~/ RgRhtRaIP0RcaHR0 cHM6Ly9iaW9lbmd pbmVlcmluZy5pbG xpbm9pcy5lZHUvb mV3cy9hcnRpY2xl L3BhcGVyLWJhc2V kLWVsZWN0cm9jaG VtaWNhbC1zZW5zb 3ItY292aWQtMTlX A3NwY0IKACaIkdJ f17FHrVISYm9icm FwcDJAeWFob28uY 29tWAQAAAAP,Easy way to join the Illuminati brotherhood in the world.

Thank you to our entire Illinois community for your patience and understanding this semester. We have done what many other universities in the country have not been able to do—come back to campus and stay together.  A few student reminders about Fall Break:  + All instruction and exams will be fully online after Fall Break. + Limit your activity before you travel to limit virus spread. + If you travel::: plan to remain away until you return for the Spring semester::: if possible. + If you return after Fall Break::: you should test for COVID-19 as soon as possible. Testing locations will still be open.  A few important updates for Spring 2021:  + Like the Fall 2020 semester::: the Spring 2021 semester will include a blend of in-person and remote instruction. + The first day of classes has been pushed back to Monday::: Jan. 25. + There will be no Spring Break. + There will be three additional non-instruction break days: Feb. 17::: March 24 & April 13. + Two negative tests are required to return to in-person classes at the start of the semester. Students should participate in essential activities only::: such as buying groceries::: until then.  The health and safety of our entire community remain our top priority.

Common sense is not strong in Jones.,Wow just wow show us all how to do it!!,Enrolling for an online vet course soon.,THANK YOU Chancellor Jones and everyone at UIUC - faculty::: staff::: and students - who are working hard and doing their part to make a safe learning environment possible. I am praying daily for all of you::: including those who are struggling to make the right decisions.,Smart students making smart decisions...so proud of you!,Illini proud!,Are the numbers in from students who traveled out of town::: and then returned::: after Labor Day weekend?,Thank you so much for the straightforward and excellent communication with the students::: parents::: and the greater community.

Through the University’s Shield testing program::: we have access to real-time data and can quickly detect emerging increases in positive COVID-19 cases on campus. Over these past few days::: the actions of a small number of students have led to a concerning increase in the number of new undergraduate COVID-19 positive cases.  We are continually monitoring our total number of COVID-19 cases and positivity rates::: and each act of non-compliance affects the trajectory of the Fall 2020 semester. As a result::: we are taking some immediate steps to help break the cycle.  -We are going to focus these next two weeks on identifying those individuals who are endangering everyone in our community::: and we are taking disciplinary action::: including suspensions of individuals and organizations.  -We believe the damage done by these individuals can be reversed. But it must be done quickly. For two weeks::: starting today at 5 p.m.::: for their own protection::: we expect all undergraduate students to limit their in-person interactions to only the most essential activities. These include things like taking their twice weekly COVID-19 tests::: attending classes::: purchasing groceries and food::: going to work::: engaging in individual outdoor activity::: attending religious services and seeking medical attention.  -And here is the hardest part: We need students to strictly avoid social gatherings under any circumstances for these two weeks. We know what we are asking with this. Being together with friends is a big part of why students chose to come back. It is not fair that everyone will need to do their part to fix a situation they did not cause. But this is where we are now::: and this is what it will take to repair the damage in time to break the cycle of increasing new cases.  Why are we doing this now?  -Some students have ignored the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District (CUPHD) directives to isolate or quarantine::: choosing to go out while knowing they are positive for the virus.  -Some students who have tested positive are actively avoiding our contact tracing requests from CUPHD. Contact tracing helps identify people who may have been exposed.  -Over the weekend::: we received 11 complaints about large gatherings inside fraternities and private houses.  -Over the weekend::: we responded to more than 100 party-related calls.  We’ve given ourselves a real chance to come together and to stay together. But the decision to do so is in your hands.  Stay home. Avoid social gatherings. It comes down to these next two weeks.  Learn more: bit.ly/3jFxBfO,2020-09-02 19:53:45,U of I students::: the entire country is watching you right now. You can either be an example or be a failure. The virus won't allow a middle ground::: it's too infectious.  I think the university should expell any student caught violating isolation and social distancing directives. They are not behaving in line with the spirit of our school and its mission and should be got rid of::: period. They do not have the caliber to be proper Illini. Also::: I think any frat or sorority caught violating these directives should be immediately and permanently disbanded. The University of Wyoming had an issue many years ago with a frat that regularly violated the rules::: so the University just bulldozed their frat house. I think we should take a page from the book of the west and set a swift and decisive example that no student will feel confident in ignoring.,Every kid I’ve known whose tested positive has had 0-2 symptoms and been fully recovered by the time their 2nd test comes out! And that includes multiple different universities across the Midwest region. It’s time to start only requiring those with symptoms to take tests! If you want them to stay and experience college the way they’re supposed to::: then don’t force them to only leave their dorms for essentials and stay in their teeny tiny rooms ALL day for class. Am I the only one who thinks this system is crazy???They are being treated like lab rats for research purposes over there and it’s time to lighten up. Their sanity is completely being tested right now. I’ve never experienced so many depressing phone calls from my daughter and it’s completely breaking my heart. Other schools aren’t doing it this way and I don’t think the end result will be any better:( So sad. There’s got to be a better way,The University of Illinois made a financial decision to bring back 49:::000 students to a 4 mile radius campus. As an institute you continue to push in the media that the rampant positive coronavirus cases are due to the reckless behaviors of the students. The chancellor’s office made a reckless decision by bringing all students and staff back to campus. You told freshman students they had the choice to stay home and waive their acceptance for a year however any online classes they took at other colleges or universities would not count towards their degree. You put freshmen in crowded dorm buildings with 400-600 students::: and have encouraged them up until today to go home to quarantine if they test positive or have exposure to a positive case. You have put the health of your students::: staff and their families at risk. Thank God my daughters have continued to test negative while in quarantine but for those less fortunate it has greatly impacted their daily lives including work and school. Keep blaming the students in the media. What a joke! Your financial decision was reckless!,This was foreseeable::: I can't understand why my alma mater::: an institution of higher learning::: didn't see this coming.  When positivity rates::: hospitalization s::: even deaths rise in Champaign-Urban a in the coming weeks::: the blame falls on you.,If I was 20 and just got back from a summer at my parents' house::: it would have been hard for me to remain in a room alone for 14 days. Just being honest,Close the DAMM social houses..send the kids home..,Why did you have so many kids come the same 2 days with testing being so far behind and nowhere to quarantine before getting results,I have a feeling they are going to be coming home soon. 😢,It would be *fantastic* if the higher-ups at Student Housing fell in line with this stringent policy. When the director of the Child Development Lab emailed to express concerns about the girls of Sigma Delta Tau doing their yearly chant - packed like sardines on the staircase without a mask in sight - he got a reply that it would be “bad optics” to cast a negative light on the Greek system. Disgusting.,All the Bars on Green street need to be Closed. Saw too many kids walking all of Green street without masks and not 6 feet apart and this was on weekend of Aug 21 to Aug 23 before they started school. State of Illinois should give citations out those facilities where food is not given but liquor is poured::: especially in Green street. Couple of bars here in Chicago closed down by City for the same reason. U of I knows the bars these kids go to.,Well done UIUC! Kudos::: leading the world with your testing platform and technology. If the folks on campus will comply::: this could be resolved in only a couple of weeks!,There’s always a couple (at least) “rebellious” people in every crowd. Kudos to the UI for tracking them and putting suspensions in place! All those that don’t want to comply can go elsewhere!,The University has seen 450 cases in the last two weeks. I am glad they are taking it seriously.,Who is paying for all this testing?,Are you working with other state schools to help them adopt this program quickly? My daughter is at ISU and I keep seeing stories about their high positivity rate and slow turnaround for results.,I appreciate your efforts !! The app idea is genius and 2x a week testing protects students::: faculty::: and the community !Thank you for keeping my daughter as safe as possible during a pandemic !!! Things can’t get back to normal until the virus is under control & I’m holding out hope for spring volleyball 🏐 🔥🔸🔹🔸,The case rate is really irrelevant. This Chinese virus is going to spread in the community. That’s just a fact of a virus. AND most importantly it is not threatening the lives of college age students. What is threatening the welfare of students is their inability to resume to their normal life on campus.,Must go Distance Learning only at this time,Thank you for taking this seriously and protecting students::: faculty and staff. One proud alumna,I hope the plan that U of I laid out works. It is the only large university doing this level of testing on campus and contract tracing even when most classes are online so it allows for kids to have the ability to be on campus and have some semblance of a normal fall semester experience. I wish all students will comply and allow the University to succeed. It will be a moment of pride if they can get past this hurdle and succeed and show the world how it can be done.,So the large gatherings for marches aren’t contributing to the spread?,Disappointing Illini. We can do better.,Very satisfied with how UIUC is trying its best to protect students::: staff and faculty. It’s not a perfect system::: it is a pandemic::: we have never lived through this. The young adults should give it the good old “college try”. It’s difficult. I feel the end justifies the means.,What did you expect? This is exactly what I knew would happen.,Grateful for how things are being handled but I am concerned hearing that my daughter walks by groups of officers at the police academy daily without masks on is definitely concerning . I get masks are not required outside but when you’re standing in a group ::: less than 6 feet a part they should be wearing masks and they are not,How many of these positive cases are actually showing any symptoms?,ANY word on when the saliva tests will be open to the surrounding CU community?,We are on board::: and we too are incredibly proud of how UI is able to still offer vital in-person classes at such a time. I just transferred here and I’m happy I chose this university::: and honored to play my part in it 🙂 We are all learning to adapt::: and although it’s difficult::: we are careful and following the CDC guidelines. I think that there’s a few individuals who don’t see things that way and yeah::: they can go elsewhere 😒,I hope the University is ensuring that RAs in the residence halls are enforcing this. Because in my student’s dorm::: there have been parties and RA has stated that they don’t care about enforcing rules.,I understand the seriousness of this situation. But why open and invite students to come to campus? My freshman is there::: taking this educational step::: but not going out::: unable to meet anyone. all classes moved to online::: no activities::: no way to connect. Tuition and fees are FULL price. Very hard decisions need to be made::: compliant students are miserable.,My student received two texts threatening swift suspension yesterday because their records showed he wasn’t in compliance with testing which was incorrect (the time between testing and posting results is getting longer). Threatening interim suspension to the students that are in compliance will not engage them. Kids are losing confidence in the system-they’re frustrated and scared.,My son was exposed to Covid on Saturday. He took a test on Monday and still no results today (Thursday). This is not acceptable. At the direction of CUPHD he took another Covid test on Wednesday and also no results. They told him to hang in his room. He feels uneasy going to the dining hall to get food::: worried he has Covid (has many symptoms). What happened to school designated quarantine? School checking on him medically::: delivering food to him? He needs to eat to keep his strength up. The University made one of his classes in person so he's at the campus. I would assume that they should be taking care of him during this time. Hoping for some answers/ direction soon.,Sad to see a small group of individuals ruining it for everyone on campus. No::: its not expected from college students to not follow the rules; most are mature and take their education seriously. Its the small group of people who::: and always had::: feel as though they're above others and the law. Their individualistic mindset is ruining a system that could have most defiantly worked for all.,Shut them down. Put anyone that is positive in mandatory isolation. Asking young adults (basically children) to do what it right for the entire student body is like hearding cats.,Students have to do their part to ensure the success of the testing program; If not::: cases will undoubtedly spike.,COME ON U of I. Be better than this. You can pull together and stop this spread. Work together please. 🙏🏼 Kudos to U of I for doing all they can. Students have to do their part to make this system work.,It’s not going to be perfect::: I’m impressed at UIUC taking it seriously and having a plan and strategy. It’s a great job to try and lead the way in a unique situation. At least a serious crisis is not being ignored or lied about. I’m hoping they are leading the way for others::: we will see if students will get on board and be those leaders!,I hope you succeed. You have laid out such a great plan. The students will either make it work with self-discipline or they will be the reason it fails.,You are still living in a dream world. Why not face the reality that this cannot work? I've been a University professor for 25 years::: and I shouldn't need to tell you you cannot get the behavior you're asking for::: from this age group.

Netflix time!,does anyone know if there's a way to see # students actually sick (seriously ill)? have the + cases overwhelmed mckinley? another health care system?,I’m thoroughly impressed by the actions and response taken by the school for the health and safety of all students::: their families::: and the surrounding community.  Other schools are not taking this seriously at all and people are going to die because of it.  Kudos to you::: U of I::: you’re an example that I hope other schools will follow.,It’s just so sad that some people can’t follow the rules and then ruin it for the majority.,I’d rather see an approach that scrupulously follows the Constitution. Any student facing punishment should be provided an attorney and tried in a real court with due process. It didn’t take a genius to see a sharp rise is cases when students returned. The university did a tremendous job of setting up testing. But that doesn’t give him the right to restrict travel over the holiday weekend::: or to Put trackers on every student to follow their movements. Sounds great but it is not legal. My .02,Shut down Greek chapters and other groups that have parties. Entitled actions should have immediate consequences on those who think they're above the law. Why make everyone suffer?,Have you closed bars? If not::: it's not going to work.,Wow twice a week testing seems good::: but still counting on all of people doing the right thing::: the problem is that all it takes is a few actions by few people and away the spread goes::: good luck::: no real govt standards and expectations = taking it's course,I hope the penalties for noncompliance are swift and harsh. A few students should not be able to ruin it for the many who are following the rules. I’m especially appalled by the students who are trying to circumvent the app.,Aren't these students legal adults who are paying enormous sums of money to attend your communist think tank? I think had you tried this when I attended::: I'd have told you to pound sand. Herd immunity is actually a thing. A rise in cases with how many hospitalization s or deaths? For a high level university::: you've got some low level thinkers making decisions.,Isn't that the truth!,I gave the U of Cal system a lot of credit for deciding in May to be virtual in the fall. And in light of what is going on in California and in a number of other large universities they now look like geniuses.

The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign has processed 105:::000+ tests since testing began in July. This accounts for about 1-3% of daily tests in the nation.  The positivity rate on campus is 0.70% in the past five days::: compared to the CDC's national average rate of 9%.  As you'll see on the dashboard::: the test positivity rate went down after the bump from entry screening. Unlike other universities::: positive cases are isolated and contacts are quarantined::: and the persistent and frequent nature of our testing means that we will continue to catch residual infections that spring up. All these numbers are as predicted by our expert data models.  The dashboard is updated regularly here: go.illinois.edu/COVIDTestingData,2020-08-26 19:37:59,So::: so proud and happy my daughter is there!! Trying their best at the highest level!,Lead the nation in the pandemic response!,Way to keep students and staff safe!!,This is like saying it’s a good idea to put 500 students in a large lecture hall and make them play Russian Roulette with a mortality rate hovering at 5%,Amazing job::: keep up the great work!,Yes!,Well done::: Illinois. The CDC is now (as of 8/ 24) inexplicably recommending testing only if COVID symptoms are present. This despite the fact that people are most likely to transmit the virus when they are pre-symptomatic. I am happy to see that Illinois is being much more proactive.,I’ve got a student at Illinois and a student at Iowa. Illinois hands down is doing a far better job protecting its students. My child there feels safe I cannot say the same of my Iowa child.,Doing a great job with testing.,The University of Illinois continues to demonstrate the effectiveness of continual testing of its students. Does your school system have a positivity rate of .70%?,So proud of this! Well done!,Proud to be an Illini! Keep up the good fight!,Keep up the good work! This is exactly what we should be doing nationwide.,Way to go::: let's protect the young future leaders of our country!,Proud of the scientific approach combined with care::: concern and community! Keep it up Illinois!,Keep up the good work! So proud of my school trying so diligently to keep students and staff safe.,So incredibly proud of the University and what they are doing to keep the students safe.,Other developed nations used daily testing of their populations and not just when a person presented symptoms. They were able to keep infection rates down by doing this and immediately isolate the positive cases (good example is Korea). By the university doing this::: I think this will prove to the nation that constant and frequent testing and isolation is key to keeping this under control.,CDC just recommended less testing this morning. It’s coming from the “top” of the administration::: not from medical or scientific people. Fauci is concerned.,Andrea Lemke Apparently they’re either still too busy politicking or haven’t hired a statistician on staff yet 🤦🏻‍♂️ (Check the link...I don’t think the real data is all that surprising! Apparently there’s a negative correlation between test positivity and total # of tests? 😂),Go Illini!,U of I blows away my other child’s school for testing ! So glad they are on top of things and the kids are well informed of where they can go for testing. Eases my mind for my freshman!,After reading majority of the comments I came to conclusion that people will always find a way to complain. Can we just enjoy small victories ? The fact that our kids actually have a shot at being at campus in monitored environment::: enjoying making new friends::: learning to live on their own is priceless to me.,Way to go Illinois💙🧡please help Illinois State that’s not doing as well controlling this crazy virus,It’s my understanding there’s more asymptomatic testing occurring many places.,I think you are amazing and for all those saying don’t compare Illinois to the national rates... then let’s compare it to the following universities: Alabama::: Notre Dame::: North Carolina....sha ll I go on?,I understand that response times are getting much longer and inhibiting students access to facilities.,Proud to be sending both my sons there,So you’re forcing contact tracing on others. Cool.,A model for national testing! Good work Illini!,Congrats on a well forumlated and well executed strategy for dealing with this situation. The results are impressive and more importantly keeping all well. I am curious::: when will the results be sufficiently positive enough to begin in-class instruction again?,Who is paying for all the testing?,Awesome job Illinois!! Maybe the rest of the US will follow along!,This is way too soon to be bragging::: guys. Wait a couple of weeks. You don't have enough data to be making these claims. Usually bumps come 14-21 days after a major event like a holiday (or dorm move-in),Testing without showing any symptoms is basically pointless::: one can be negative::: and two weeks later can be positive::: does that mean that one needs to be tested everyday?!,It’s the power of ‘I’🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸,Thank you for helping our kids to stay safe 🥰,If you ran the country maybe there would be less deaths and we could get our lives back. This is what the advisors have been saying for months. Test and trace. Could you please run a national program? Congratulations on your success.,Besides doing tests::: Are you Educating people just In case They are positive what measures They are to take?  Are you reminding the need to protect their eyes besides mouth And nose?,Go Illini::: we got this as usual::: that is the orange and blue that runs in our veins!,Happy to see this transparency and glad things seem to be going well so far.,Extremely impressive - This is how it should be done everywhere!,Don't get me wrong because I think this approach and response to the pandemic is a fantastic use of innovation and resources::: but this seems to be a bit of statistic manipulation comparing positivity rates on campus to the national average. Nationally::: aren't people typically only getting tested if they are symptomatic and have a REASON to be tested? Here on campus::: the entire population is basically getting tested. I'm curious what the national positivity rate would be if the same type of testing were applied to entire communities::: not just those exhibiting symptoms::: and hopefully this system can be scaled nationally and used the same way across the country to the way it's being used here.,Thank you::: Illinois::: for showing the nation how a school and a campus CAN reopen successfully!!! I-L-L,Please send testing process to SIU Carbondale. I can't believe they only have 3 positives... and those are all off campus students,So impressive and beyond well done. I wish all organizations could get on board.,My Alma mater rocks! #uiuc,Please update the test results. The results were 2 days delayed (expected) but there have been no updates for 5 days now.,Solving problems with science and common sense. Love it!,Are you sharing your numbers with Champaign County so they can reflect an accurate profile for the community?,Thank you::: University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaig n for leading the country!

Several Universities in an out of state location have had to switch to online only. Unfortunately it was after many students already caught Coronavirus.,That is some company line. It's not safe for students or instructors to be face to face. Not because of class contact::: but because of students having close contact with other students outside of classes. All courses should be offered online. U of I is currently claiming 109 Covid cases. We have 311 active cases in CU (some of which are U of I staff).,Stay safe,Oh no. Haven’t you heard?

Natalie had covid on July 13th so the virus is still in her system and this is why she is testing positive. Our friend who is a doctor said once you have had covid it can stay in your system for a few months which will cause you to test positive.  She is not contagious and does not currently have covid so she needs to be let out of her dorm room and into buildings on campus. She has been sitting in her dorm for a few days waiting for someone to call her back. My wife drove down to Champaign today to try to figure this out but no one was able to help us so that is why I am contacting you. We are both extremely frustrated and upset.  She is not able to go downstairs and eat or go to her in person classes. Both University of Wisconsin and Boston College are not testing students who have recently had covid. Natalie has her positive results from July to show. Is there any way you can help us or have some contact me or my daughter.  Brendan Cooney 630-460-7618  MY DAUGHTER’S INFO…..  Natalie Cooney Bromley Hall #417 (630)460-6692 natcooney@comca st.net,According to Fox News::: already 109 positive COVID cases based on campus testing.,🧡💙,Let’s do this::: Illini!

At #ILLINOIS::: we have an opportunity many others in the country do not. It is up to all of us to make it a reality.  If you go to an in-person class this week::: here's what to expect: - Early arrivals.

Look for a Block I or Sit Here sign. - Hand sanitizer & wipes at entrances to clean your seat. - Fixed furniture. Please don't move any desks or chairs. - Social distancing between class periods.  We’ve given ourselves the chance to succeed at something that has never been attempted before.

The on-campus COVID-19 tests processed at #ILLINOIS now account for about 1-2% of the total daily tests conducted in the entire United States.  Our innovative saliva test is free::: safe & effective—and can make all the difference in our ability to stay together.

Really cool x,🧡💙,Way to go ILLINOIS!!,Proud to be an alum! Keep up the good work 🔶🔷,Congratulations . I believe that Champagne will be the first town to have rigourous tests done at this mass scale?  What's the % of positive tests you are finding so far? Would you be able to publish the stats and How many tests conducted everyday as trend?  Also besides the requirements for students and staff ::: are you requiring all residents of Champagne also to do these tests two times as week? If not::: can you please include at least all the restaurants::: rental buildings people around green Street so we can have proper contact tracing,So proud that my daughter is a part of this wonderful University !!!!!!,What numbers does the university have to be at that they consider it to be unsafe for our kids To be there.,when does the student get their results? ie: they come get tested then head to class they are in a closed classroom. The student ends up positive. Are all the people in the class notified that they have been exposed? Does the student wait for the test results before heading to class or somewhere else on Campus,🧡💙👊🏻,U of I leading the way once again!

We need you to do your part. Period.  These first weeks back are absolutely critical to our success. We know::: based on our expert data models::: that there will be an increase in cases as we move back::: and we are prepared to handle them. It's what you do when you get here that will make all the difference.  We have the best chance to stay together if:  You wear your face coverings You get tested twice a week You social distance You avoid groups & mass gatherings You quarantine & isolate when necessary  We all want the same thing: to keep our #ILLINOIS family together::: safe and healthy.  Let's do this. #IveGotYouCovered,2020-08-20 21:25:09,Best of luck to the U. of I! Prayers that they can make it work!,Why tested twice a week?,U of I could truly stand out as remarkable if the students pull this off.,UNC and NC State blew it and are online from their off-campus activities due to clusters.,Shut up::: U of I. If you really cared about the students::: you would have made **all classes 100% online**. You didn’t::: though::: because you just see students as dollar signs.  **with I myself being a former student I didn’t think I’d have to clarify but people thought I didn’t know certain classes were already offered online prior to covid,No Fraternity parties,🧡💙,Feel so proud of Illini Community.. hope all goes well🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽,Simple::: effective rules to live by until we get through this TOGETHER. Have a successful school year and be safe EVERYONE!!,Why bother? We’ll just be online in a month because nobody follows this stuff. I saw 3 pub cycles just this evening.

Thank you U of I for all the efforts.,"Quit dancing around the problem by saying ""mass gatherings"" and just say ""NO HOUSE PARTIES::: NO APARTMENT PARTIES::: NO POOL PARTIES::: NO PARTIES PERIOD.""

Let's be a great example while keeping everyone safe! We can still make this year awesome! 💙Together🧡,Daughter has one class out of 5 that are in person classes. We do not like it.

Scared for my daughter since she is in a high risk group.,I work on Green Street. Students are not taking this seriously. This was entirely predictable but you brought them back anyways. University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaig n will be responsible for businesses all around campus being forced to close::: for the many workers who will lose their jobs::: and for many unnecessary deaths. I'm deeply furious with and ashamed of my alma mater.,They're not going to get it until they get it 🤦🏽‍♀️,Go Illini!! Thanks for all your doing! Proud of UIUC!! So glad my son is returning student!!,How can alumni order masks?,Good luck & God Bless to all Fighting Illini 🙏🇺🇸,Praying that all goes well 🙏🙏,The way to manage this would have been to go 100% online::: close the dorms::: tell the students to stay home AND tell students who have no other choice than to be in residence in CU::: to test twice weekly and follow all of the guidelines that are currently set up.  Developing the test is great::: but inviting everyone back is not responsible. One did not mandate the other.,Did you feel pride about our test getting FDA approval? Imagine how proud you’ll feel if we make it to Thanksgiving break without going to full remote classes.,Stay safe 🙏🙏,Yeah right they are going to behave!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This semester is even worse because you poorly planned out the veterans verification process (not shocked) and now it’ll be even longer until I can get my benefits.

We have our second child coming in today .,I suspect the reason that Illinois has been so aggressive with its reopening despite the recent uptick of cases in other universities is that it's trying to cash in on Marty Burke's recent saliva test::: and to use the data collected from students in a major COVID study. It's unethical::: it's irresponsible. August 2020 is too early of a timeframe to be admitting students back into campus when the country hasn't reigned in its staggeringly high COVID numbers.,As a former local::: the opening of campus during a highly contagious global pandemic scares me to death. It’s one thing to endanger those on campus but::: there is also a whole community that will be greatly endangered here. Expect a huge surge in COVID-19 cases BOTH ON CAMPUS AND IN THE CHAMPAIGN-URBAN A COMMUNITY. What is going to happen is entirely predictable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Frequent COVID-19 testing is foundational to our return to campus operations for the Fall 2020 semester. Everyone will have to do their part.  Throughout the semester::: all faculty::: staff and students who are on campus for any reason or length of time will be required to get tested twice a week at one of the 17 testing sites across campus.  Everyone should refrain from eating::: drinking::: tooth brushing::: mouth washing::: gum chewing and tobacco use for one hour before submitting your saliva sample.  Download the Safer Illinois app to access your testing information and results.  Together::: we can do so much.

We are within two weeks of the start of the semester.

We know you have questions about what the Fall 2020 semester will look like. We hope this answers some of them.  Last week Illinois experts had a conversation about what students and parents need to know for fall. Watch the recap. ⏬  EMAILS.ILLINOIS.EDU Recap - COVID-19 Briefing Series: Return to campus,2020-08-10 18:59:11,From what I've heard::: each student will be tested prior to receiving room keys and PPE kits. That's good; however::: the results of those tests won't be known for hours. In the meantime::: the students are allowed to move into their dorm rooms. What if one of those students tests positive? Now::: their roommate has been exposed::: along with every other student they came in contact with. The roommate now has to be quarantined.... before spending even one night in their room. Is this the procedure in place?,Binod,It’s about personal responsibility.,Betty Ann,If what I saw this past weekend is indicative of the semester. You’re in trouble. 3/4 no masks on campus and no social distancing practiced by students. Also major elephant in the room: parties::: of all types. Students will gather in other rooms for game nights or movies or even meals since the dining hall is closed. Students will go to bars::: frat parties::: or apartment parties. I know the university doesn’t have any power to stop them from doing so::: but by letting everyone come back::: they’re creating the opportunity to do so. The university time and time again likes to ignore anything that does make the school look good::: but this time it’s irresponsible and reckless.  I fully understand that not all students have a safe environment to learn from at home::: but letting anyone who wants to come to campus is asking for an outbreak. Students will not follow these guidelines::: they’re currently not following them on campus::: and I look at the social media’s of my friends not on campus and they’re currently making dangerous choices and not following CDC guidelines so what makes you think it will change when they get to campus. I know several people who are returning just so they can party. And the school is giving them that opportunity. Yikes. This will be a disaster.,Emily Hou,No football.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While so much has changed over the past few months::: one thing will always remain. The #ILLINOIS experience.  We asked students what they were most looking forward to about coming back to campus. The #1 answer was to have a better learning environment and support structure.  At Illinois::: we want you to succeed. We are here to challenge you::: to provide you opportunities to grow and to cheer you on in the process.  When you come back to campus::: you are coming back to your home::: your community.  The duration of the pandemic is uncertain. But what we know for sure is that we are investing in the resources::: testing and technology to maximize the health and safety of the entire Illinois community—while continuing to deliver on our mission: to enhance the lives of citizens in Illinois::: across the nation and around the world.,2020-08-07 15:54:19,Right.......,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Let's all do our part so we can stay together. 🔸🔹  #IveGotYouCovered | covid19.illinois.edu/pledge,2020-07-17 18:30:31,THERE WILL BE PARTIES ON DAY ONE.  You're not socially distancing at parties. You're not wearing a mask while drinking at parties. Germs will be spread at an alarming rate. This will happen around the country::: college towns will get hit hard::: then those schools will decide (like they did in the spring) to shut down. Those infected students will then carry the virus back to their respective home towns and we'll all be shut down until sometime after the holidays. 😒,At least UIUC has the testing which is wonderful. It will make it safer. I think the police and or the university should patrol around and look for parties and everyone involved should be kicked out of the school::: maybe with that in mind they will think twice about having parties.,https:// dev-dunelandmedi a.com/ houseofstainless /product/ hand-sanitizer-f loor-stand/,Are those out in front of the bars too?,Anyone want to guess a date when Illinois schools close down due to Covid 19?

The #ILLINOIS family is not confined to one location. Our impact is global.  We are joining with our peer institutions and others in the filing of amicus briefs in support of the F-1 visa suit filed by Harvard and MIT.  We have worked with the State of Illinois Attorney General in support of additional litigation filed today seeking to block the implementation of these new rules.  Our priority is to support our students::: and we are committed to standing up for the institutional values that define our university.  More information on the State of Illinois Attorney General litigation ▶ https://bit.ly/2CsQkv0,2020-07-13 21:47:15,On Tuesday::: a decision was reached in the lawsuit filed by Harvard and MIT regarding the ICE and SEVP announcements of July 6 and 7. The U.S. government has agreed to rescind those policy statements and FAQs and allow the previously issued guidance for Spring 2020 to remain in effect. Illinois International will communicate in greater detail after they have examined the decision carefully. However::: with the previous guidance now in effect::: international students on F-1 status will be able to keep this status for Fall 2020 provided they register for a full course load::: regardless of whether these courses are in person or via remote learning.,So proud of my alma mater 🧡💙,Almost half of the students accepted are white. Research the data and see the percentage of foreign and other students measure up. If you are not accepted::: you can have an idea of your chances of acceptance. Affirmative Action is needed for this school. Hope you find a University who wants to help the under privelge a chance for a better life. As long as you show potential. Research Universities for a better chance of acceptance. Choose a school that will give you a shot at their institution.,Sounds reasonable. Are you not prepared to meet the requirements?,Thank you !!,U💙OF I🧡,Megan Nicole,Megan Nicole,Megan Nicole,Monique Aris,Brianna Marie go U of I!,Proud to stand with my Alma Mater on this one!,Don’t betray the primary mission of UIUC: to educate the Americans to further themselves and society. Put Americans First. FYI::: I am not white either.,Thank you! Proud of my Alma mater!,One important question: why is it so critical to the University of Illinois that foreign students who will have to take on-line classes actually COME to Illinois? Is there a separate tuition rate for that? No::: Will they get the same education? If you do your job right::: yes. So why is the student's physical location in the US important?,Thank u,Yes!!!! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!,Where are updates about how the university will protect students this fall!!,Tell us what we can do.,If UIUC now supports their students::: I am glad to hear it. When I was there in 1966::: the policy was to eliminate students::: no matter how::: even if the student's father died during registration week for their senior year::: even if I was supporting my mother::: for the selection of the casket and during the funeral.  For shame::: Illinois.,Thank you,Ridiculous that 10% of the students in Champaign are from communist China. Chinese students segregate themselves from the other students and do not really try to assimilate into the culture of the school.,Liberal indoctrination university. Where they’ll teach ur kid how racist they are!!!,Sweet memories.,Having attended UIUC as an overseas student for my graduate studies (MS::: PhD)::: the experience of being on a visa is always a tenuous one. Renewals::: restrictions::: etc.  I am very pleased that the University is taking this stand.,How do you take a class online when it’s in the middle of the night where you are in the world? Possible::: but not practical.,Foreign students studying on campus not only get the best education we offer but they also get taste of our culture::: our liberty and freedom and respect for each others as they meet other students on campus. Online would deny them this experience. This experience helps in bringing democracy around the world.,Proud of my alma mater!,Internet access is key,Thank you::: very nice place,Brava to my alma mater!,100 % true,Another wrong move by the U of I! If foreign students are taking classes online::: there is no need for them to be on campus! Stay home and save money!,YAY!!!,Proud of you!,Maybe a lot of foreign students are already here::: couldn't go home and still want to finish their education.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

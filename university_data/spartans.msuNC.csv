I have a BA mostly on line from Columbia college. My son is enrolled MSU online and compared to mine it’s irregular::: lot of last minute add on::: assignments are downloaded late and due dates get changed at last minute. Grading errors frequently.

Hmmm.....,I honestly don't trust this at all. The Buses have closed their doors on me before I was completely out and that's with a driver. Students are constantly running across the roads at places where there aren't crosswalks. And creeps ride those buses at night.

The bus driver clipped the barricades with the narrowed lanes and jumped the curb::: hitting them both and dragging them under. Driver had no clue he hit anyone and it was a passenger who was able to get it stopped. Now::: imagine an emergency on an unmanned/ driverless bus.

For the first time nationally::: Impact 89FM - WDBM has been named the College Radio Station of the Year.  MSUTODAY.MSU.EDU Impact 89FM named 2021 College Radio Station of the Year,2021-11-02 13:00:07,OUTSTANDING!!! Congrats!!!!,Well deserved! 15 years removed and I still tune in when I'm travelling across the state.,Loved listening on Sunday nights during high school in the late 80’s. Every Sunday night they ended the show at midnight with I Don’t Like Mondays. I also loved House Music on Saturday nights. Congratulations !!!,Congratulations IMPACT! Some of my favorite MSU memories were in the hallowed halls of the old auditorium studios!,I remember tuning in on day 1! IIRC::: I believe the first song played was Change by Fishbone from Truth and Soul and song 3 being Orinoco Flow by Enya from Watermark. So in line with / influencing what I was listening to back then. Congrats to the Impact 89FM team!,"Congratulations !! I was a DJ here on a night shift in the 90's - there was a black phone in the studio - the ""bat phone"" - that would supposedly only ring if there was an emergency. It rang one night when I was working - alone and terrified::: I answered::: only to be told I had the record (yes::: record!) on the wrong speed! Clearly the DJs have improved! Well deserved 89FM!",More like the century! Best radio station across the country hands down and well deserved to have this recognition!!,Honestly I'm shocked this is the first win for you guys. Still one of the best stations anywhere!,Great to see the station has made it to the top of the college ranks. I was one of the first DJ's back in late 1987 when it was launched as WBDM. Now I'm having flashbacks to Gary Reid and Dr. Tom Muth! Keep it going Spartan Strong,When I was in college the student radio station was an AM station that hardly anyone listened to::: but they gave away pizza certificates and movie passes regularly. The DJ would say we have a free pizza for caller number 8. I would call in and he would say::: you're called #1::: try again. I would keep trying and I was every single caller::: 1 through 8::: so I won the pizza. Same with movie passes. They put a limit that I could only win once a week. I told others on my floor::: so we could plan on pizza for Sunday night when there was no dinner served in the dorms. We did it all the time::: rotating whose job it was to win the pizza each week.,Congrats::: from an old DBM D.J. Loved my time there.,I was on the air pre-Impact on a little AM that had a signal that maybe covered the entire Brody complex back in 1979. Kudos to those running it now and to those who have been a part of MSU radio in the past.,Go Green!💚,Congrats! Loyal listener since day one!,This is outstanding!!,WoooHooo!

Mary Mayo is MSU's most infamous ghost story::: but MSU Campus Archaeology Program uncovered more spooky history and hauntings.  MSU.EDU Spartan Spirits,2021-10-27 13:00:04,I lived in 666 East McDonnell. I had a microwave that would beep at odd times for no reason as well as a TV that would start glowing a green screen:::::: sometimes the volume would turn all the way up and the only way to turn it off would be to unplug it. I took the TV in to be fixed over Christmas break and was told nothing was wrong with it.,3 years in Mayo::: the best! I think my only ghost encounters were aided by trips to Crunchy's or Rick's.,I must say that the two amazing years ‘76-‘78 that I lived in Mary Mayo Hall::: I never noticed anything unusual except for very clangy old radiators. The basement however::: was more than creepy. 👻👻👻,Super scary. I’m glad I didn’t see the ghost of Mary Mayo when I lived on 3rd floor.,I lived in Mary Mayo Hall. Never saw any haunted happenings.,Is there anywhere to read about all of these hauntings? Lived in Williams and Gilchrist and never had any strange happenings.,I never heard of one scary story the whole time I attended. DX,Have a good Halloween Spartans and wear whatever costumes you want! Just like the Spartans of old::: what you do/say/ or wear shouldn't be predicated off of someone else's insecurities!! Unfortunately::: one of your staffers sent out emails stating otherwise. Seems this person needs to be more comfortable and take pride in their self and worry less about what others do. Happy Halloween!,My mother lived in Mary Mayo around 1938,Lived in west Mayo. Rm 160. Loved it and never had any encounters with any ghosts.,My most favorite MSU dorm was Mary Mayo Hall. I moved back on campus just to live there.,Still think fondly of the dormitory that bears her name.,I lived in Mary Mayo & missed out on the Hauntings,I lived in East Mary Mayo::: mid-1960’s::: three years on 3rd floor::: and had no spooky encounters.,I can't get it to s roll so I can read it. Please fix it.,Care to address the racism,DeeDee Corrigan Rainville,I lived in Mayo in 98-99...I never experienced anything::: but my RA told a story about being in the building before the students arrived for the year and having some weird experiences. Also::: I had heard ghost stories about Williams Hall::: right next to Mayo.,Julie Christine did you know Mayo was haunted? I never noticed anything 🤷‍♀️,Nothing about the ghost of James Dallas Egbert in south complex?,I stayed in Mary Mayo in the late 1970s and saw no ghosts.,Averie McSweeney,Go Greens::: Go Whites::: beat the Yellow Stripes.,Lisa Yates remember when the piano would play all by itself in the middle of the night::: Gilchrist Hall?,Olivia Hagan,Jane McGrew Sabrina Shingleton remember haunted mason abbott,This pic makes me think about Ghostbusters..,Heather Bowe Kate Ferguson Bowe Elaine Thomsen Bowe,Did you ever hear this ghost story at MSU? Autumn Massey,Danielle Schmidt,Samantha Bitzer,Samantha Anne Holley,Therese Marie Abdoo,Matthew Fazekas Clara Pater,Louise DuRussel::: Jacob Bierlein,Kayla Crumbaugh Moriah HC Mary Mayo to Kayla,Kara Earley,Emma Notestine,Tim Silverthorn,Becky Fogle Reeves,Lena Doyle,Beautiful dorm and like an old mansion.3 floors:::small elevator:::switch board operators.Brida l showers in the basement. A House Mother to check you in!🌞,No wonder the dorm named after her is the creepiest one on campus,Wonder if my grands know the stories?? Or my son who works for the school??,Denise Galarneau you should share your Mary Mayo ghost story!,I lived in Mayo in 1998/99 and there was a LOT of creepy stuff that happened on the 3rd floor. I was in 311. A room down the hall had their window fly open the in the middle of the night::: once even the windows were closed everything on top of a dresser went flying off onto the floor::: their door would close and the deadbolt would lock when they were outside of the room. One morning I woke up and all of the glowy stars that had been all over my ceiling were stacked in a neat pile all stuck together at the foot of my bed. I had no roommate and no idea how I would have done all that in my sleep. The basement 😳 that’s like another level!!,Supposedly room 48 in Campbell Hall is haunted.,This what you teach these people?,"I have just seen the most idiotic thing ever. An email about ""costumes"" on Halloween::: put out by you idiots. There you go::: find a way to racialize and ruin everything that children once held sacred. If it ""offends"" one person::: it's got to go? So the other people don't matter? Liberalism is truly a mental disease. And just like people that are genuinely mentally ill::: you don't know that you're ill. And yes::: you people are certainly ill. Sadly::: you're indoctrinating young people into your idiotic and wrong way of thinking. But to you::: it all sounds great. Yep. Mentally ill.",This is one of my favorite spooky videos for MSU. And it is particularly relevant this week. https:// youtu.be/ BZYmuAIYB2o,Beautiful

The MSU Rock this morning.  MSU occupies the ancestral::: traditional::: and contemporary Lands of the Anishinaabeg – Three Fires Confederacy of Ojibwe::: Odawa::: and Potawatomi peoples. In particular::: the University resides on Land ceded in the 1819 Treaty of Saginaw. http://aisp.msu.edu/about/land/,2021-10-11 14:13:16,Much love today to everyone with Native American roots.,Amazing what you can learn about MSU::: where 2 of our grands attend and son works!,"I wholeheartedly support the courageous stand MSU (my alma mater '76) is taking. I remember the pride with which MSU's status as the ""first land grant college"" was voiced when I was a student. Now we are becoming more informed and recognize the great displacement and dispossession of land which belonged to so many indigenous people. It is clear that you are making a very courageous move in shifting your position and adopting the Land Acknowledgment statement. Kudos!",My great grandmother was forcibly removed from her parents and sent to the Industrial Boarding School in Mount Pleasant in the 1920s. Tell me again how this is old history? My grandmother never taught me her native traditions due to knowing how her mother was treated. She was afraid to share her culture even after our tribe became recognized.,This is great. Love it.  However::: why does this only happen on 12 Oct? Are the people that blame Columbus (an Italian funded by the Spanish) for the genocide against the indigenous peoples in North America (committed by people from another European country) aware that they are just spreading propaganda and shifting the blame away from those who actually deserve it?,"As an MSU Alum::: I am disappointed that my alma mater is participating in the erasure of our nation's history!  To promote ""Indigenous Peoples Day"" on October 12 is a flagrant part of the Cancel Culture sweeping this generation in this decade.  It is a fad::: and a dangerous one at that.  Indigenous People can and certainly should be celebrated::: just as every other people group ought to be. But that is not the intent here of MSU - MSU is cancelling Columbus Day.  Very disappointed.",So many ignorant people on this feed….  Great job MSU and thank you.,How did MSU get so woke? Why not just celebrate Native Americans on another holiday. Why celebrate it on Columbus Day? The power struggle continues….. why don’t you give the land back Michigan State University if it were really important to you.,I don’t believe anyone is rewriting history. It’s expanding our understanding of it. The history we learned in school as children was from the point of view of those in charge- the white governing class. Acknowledging that there were other viewpoints during the same events doesn’t change history::: it simply broadens our scope of knowledge. When dealing with Columbus’ “ discovery of America “ ( as we learned it in school) ::: for example::: the point of view of native Americans at the time was very different from that of the Europeans. That view has never been considered or recognized as valid. Now we’re learning the same events from others’ viewpoint. I’ve no problem with it.,"So many of you... Do NOT know what you don't know. You're complete ignorance to the history of Native Tribes in this state is not a surprise. The""system"" has been lying to you from day one and most of what I read here is not remotely accurate. If you really want to know the truth... It's out there. I just don't understand the insatiable need to get on a thread like this and then speak like you ""know it all"". Yes::: I am Native American and I grew up on an Indian Reservation and I also am a former Tribal Chief who DOES know the history. ""Misinformation "" isn't a new thing... It's been happening to our people for 300+ years. Not all tribes are the same. (just trying to help)",Only thing Columbus brought to America was the measles 😂,Proud to be a Spartan with this acknowledgement !,Yes every child does count::: but what about child trafficking?,I am glad to see this change from Columbus Day to Indigenous Peoples' Day. I find the history to be unsettling and uncomfortable::: as it should be.,Every child does indeed matter. I hope your professors consistently take this stance—not just when it’s convenient to disparage the White Man::: but also in regards to human life beginning at conception. Wouldn’t that be amazing to instruct the next generation in the sanctity of human life—including the unborn babies?!,MSU showing young men & women how to hate America,"It is altogether right that we should recognize the people's whose land we live on. But more than a ""Day"" and an image on a rock should be programs to ensure that Michigan's indigenous students have opportunities to attend MSU or any other state school. What actionable programs has MSU put in place to recruit students::: programs to support them financially::: and to mentor to success?",Every time MSU posts anything::: every old shriveled yt emerges from their crypt to say words,If we're born here in the US doesn't that make us Native Americans too? We're native-born. And we're indigenous to North American::: where we were born.....,Amazing how much vitriol there is in the following posts just acknowledging this day.....,Every child matters... Even the children in the womb. ❤,Today is Columbus Day. I am not against an Indigenous Peoples Day::: but not by taking way from Columbus or any other person or group. There is time and room to honor both. What self appointed person/group has the right to unilaterally make this decision?,In 1487::: five years before the arrival of Columbus in this hemisphere::: the Aztec empire sacrificed somewhere in the neighborhood of 84K men::: women::: and children at the re-consecration of the Great Pyramid Tenochtitlan.,Happy Columbus Day! Every child does matter including all those in the womb.,I really CAN’T with some of these comments… 😳  The white privilege and racism is real. Proud of my alma mater for sharing this and sending love and light to all my indigenous friends today.,Teach some history. Columbus Day is a U.S. holiday that commemorates the landing of Christopher Columbus in the Americas in 1492::: and Columbus Day 2021 occurs on Monday::: October 11.,Why don’t we celebrate Neil Armstrong Day? After all::: didn’t he discover the moon? 😂,So does the child in the womb matter?,Happy Columbus Day! And yes::: all lives matter.,It’s called Columbus Day.,Sad to see this Facebook page get trolled like this. Why are people so insistent on celebrating Columbus?,Wow some serious White Supremist sharing their views. It is very much evident that white privilege is a strong part of many peoples lives. Why don't you people just come out and say your for white power and be honest about what you really feel.,What is NEXT? To maintain it's INTEGRITY::: MSU must now give it's campus back to the Indigenous People they stole it from!!! - MSU '73,Columbus Day/ Indigenous People day::: whatever it’s called I still have to work!,When did we start rewarding 2nd place?,Happy Columbus Day and Happy Indigenous Peoples’ Day.,Nice virtue signal::: just like the Chinese cultural revolution headed down the same road.,Thank you MSU for recognition of the true founders. Go Green,It's Columbus Day::: stop trying to rewrite history...,Red and yellow black and white they are precious in his sight! Way to get it right MSU,It's Columbus Day!,So Brave,Ignorant people used to feel ashamed and hid and were quiet. Now look at them… wild timeline we’re on now. These comments are horrid.,It’s Columbus Day!,Happy Indigenous people day🏹,Don’t forget the Anishenaabeg people previously stole the land from the Chippewa people and forced the Chippewa to join the Anishenaabeg. So I don’t understand why MSU is honoring the Anishenaabeg people who stole the land from the Chippewa.,Happy Columbus day everybody. Go Green,It's Columbus Day,It’s Columbus Day,It's Columbus Day,No it’s Columbus Day,Also::: what’s the connection to every child mattering and Indigenous people? Stay apolitical Michigan State University. This is pathetic. Growing up I never gave Columbus a second thought. He discovered the new world. But now they’re trying to replace him::: driven by revisionist history and virtue. Now I’m a proud Italian-America n who is pro-Columbus since there is an anti-Columbus movement.,Since MSU cares so much about indigenous people::: in addition to painting a rock::: what percentage of their football ticket sales and concession sales do they plan to donate to local charities who support said indigenous people groups?  Asking for a friend.,Happy Indigenous Peoples' Day! And for those who are still celebrating that other holiday::: here's this from 2014: https:// youtu.be/ eKEwL-10s7E,So true every child matters ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️,There’s room for all of us.

Proud of this. https://go.msu.edu/nBp5,2021-09-21 13:00:00,My son had a fantastic study abroad experience this past summer in Greece. I’m not surprised that MSU has been ranked number 1 in this area!,With MSU I spent two summers in France::: one summer in Spain::: and a semester in Québec. These experiences really solidified my ability to speak French and Spanish and were pivotal in my employment. Merci !,studied in London and was an RA in London for two (2) summers; were incredible experiences! 💚🤍💚🤍💚🤍💚🤍💚,I spent a semester in London when I was a MSU student - unbelievable experience 💚🤍,I went to Australia when I was a student. Amazing experience.,My MSU abroad experience was life changing. MSU's study abroad program provides incredible opportunities for students! #globalspartans,I studied abroad in Spain and my sister in England. Such a great experience!!,"My ""Field Study"" (live-study abroad requirement) years back in Ecuador was nothing short of transformationa l in an unimaginably sweet and beautiful culture and nation. With the Spanish preparation I'd received through junior year at MSU::: locals were repeatedly surprised that I'd never previously lived in a Spanish-speakin g country. My core curriculum was Spanish and Latin American studies through Justin Morrill College and Arts & Letters Romances Languages. JMC was substantially parallel to today's College of Arts and Humanities in the Snyder-Phillips complex.  The curriculum and global view at JMC were the pathway to looking at the whole of the human experience::: adopting a second culture as an equal part of me::: and seeing far beyond::: and subsequently living in::: a world I'd not been able to imagine prior to the delight of my years at wildly-gorgeous Michigan State University.",I remember my study abroad trip in 1995 to South Africa right after Apartheid ended. It was an amazing time to be there.,Very proud of this! MSU allowed me to study abroad in Florence Italy and use my Student Euro-Rail Pass to see the great cities in Europe. I also had the opportunity to study Third World Development in the British West Indies (Barbados::: Trinidad & Tobago::: Guyana and Venezuela).

Would definitely recommend it to all students with so many program choices.,Went to Ireland on a study abroad at Michigan state. Wonderful experience,My daughter did State’s study abroad program::: including Trinity University::: and it was an amazing experience for her! 😍🤩👍🏼,All great & fine ….but I think they should actually concentrate now on holding in person classes at the campus as opposed to a huge number of online classes recently changed again to the online format & fill waiting lists to attend in person classes .,I tried doing that once but Army ROTC shot that idea down.,I graduated in 1966 having gone to 2 Summer quarters there. All the Fulbright Scholars attended that session. I gave a walking tour to 2 room mates who were new arrivals::: one from Afghanistan and the other Pakistan. They always made room mates from 2 countries so they had to speak English. The Afghani was amazing::: I think he knew as much or more English than I. Plus he learned from a British lady so he spoke in an English accent.,Loved my study abroad in London 37 years ago. Still keep in touch with friends made there.,I wish times were different..my daughter wanted to do a semester abroad last year but most programs were canceled.,Our daughter participated in the Academic Year in Freiburg (13 months)… during which she also did an internship!

"“By 2030::: we want MSU to be a premier institution that has significantly expanded opportunity for our Spartan community::: advanced equity and elevated our excellence in ways that attract world-class talent and further a vibrant::: caring community."" —President Stanley  MSUTODAY.MSU.EDU MSU releases university-wide strategic plan",2021-09-14 16:29:58,“Equity” will be the downfall of all institutions of learning and MSU along with it.,We will not fully reach those goals under Stanley’s poor woke leadership. Sad.,So that is code for some people will be made more equal than others?,If you also want to increase your US News ranking so you can move above inferior schools::: I can tell you how one of them does it. Seriously. I'd be glad to help.,Equity ::: there’s that word again Loving Hillsdale more and more,Maybe advanced equity means the new prez is going find $20million donations for the women’s Athletics programs too. LMAO 😂 😂,What is equity?,Isn't MSU that now?,Far too much equity and diversity.,advance equity? what does that mean?  does it mean fewer Asians in math and science? more Asians on the basketball team? equal men and women in the nursing program? replacing Izzo or Tucker with a woman? the president's salary equal to the gardener's? the president's residence the same as a freshman's::: um freshperson's::: residence?,“…advanced equity”? Sound like woke speak to me. Watch out MSU::: don’t dumb down your commitment to excellence with this nonsense.,Maybe advanced equity means the new prez is going find $32 million donations for the women’s Athletics programs too. LMAO 😂 😂,Advanced equity?,Kerry Fly,Sara Lee,No more donations until this equity::: diversity and “woke” crap::: along with Stanley::: are gone!!,More ultra-Leftist::: PC crap from President Stanley. Whatever happened to just being the best::: hiring the best and admitting the best::: no matter what color or gender (man or woman!) you happen to be? Equality::: YES. Equity::: NO! In order for MSU to continue to flourish::: Stanley must be fired immediately!!,“…advanced equity”?,Just Beautiful!💚,Beautiful view.,In my humble opinion::: we've been there for a very long time. We just don't get the much deserved attention or recognition. Spartans know::: however. Improvements can only make us even more awesome!,Sounds like something written by the H.R. weenies at any big company.,We love MSU!,Gogreen andgowhite,Equity is garbage and has no place in society,Nice! Beautiful Picture! 💚💚,Beautiful view,Hope MSU rises above OSU and PSU in US News university ranking in 4 years!,No::: if woke they will go broke in our lifetime,Go woke go broke,Just WTF is “equity”? Is equal opportunity not enough? If so::: how are they planning to get to this “equity” thing? Do we start handing out PhDs to vagrants walking by?,https:// www.intellectual takeout.org/ article/ focusing-diversi ty-will-destroy -america/,Attract the “world” class?

The MSU Rock this morning. 🇺🇸,2021-09-11 13:32:29,I was a Junior at MSU on 9/11 and watched in my dorm room with my roommate and friends as everything happened. We went to the candlelight vigil the next night and I remember when the rock got painted to honor those lost the first time. I'm glad to see it is still being done.,i remembered when I was a sophomore & just got back from my trigonometry class after 9am & my roommate had the tv on and minutes later saw the second plane hit the second tower of the WTC. At first::: I thought it was a movie like die hard. It was just too surreal & I was stunned. After calling my family to watch the news::: I see went to my second class. My professor made a brief lecture to end class early::: so that the students can call family & friends that’s may be in NYC. I never can forget that day & it should never be forgotten.,Crazy. Under all of those layers of paint is the one from 20 years ago at this same time. And 20 years ago today I walked past that very rock.,A beautiful rock. Beautiful tributes . Thank you for serving and thank you for sharing.,Thank you to those who were quick to repaint the rock and show respect for the lives that were taken. 🇱🇷,I was in my final year at MSU. I had just flown home to the New Jersey (the Philadelphia area) the week before for my dad's surprise retirement party. One of my mom's best friends was telling me about how her oldest son was a VP at Cantor Fitzgerald and worked on the 105th floor of the north tower. Fast forward to September 11th ... I woke up early for no reason (my first class wasn't until 11am). I called my brother who works in Manhattan when the first plane hit (he was leaving late as usual luckily). My oldest brother was getting cable installed so he was home. I called my mom to ask if she heard from her friend. RIP Don Adams 💔🙏🏾,Beautiful tribute. I was a freshman at MSU on 9/11. My professor wheeled a tv into our small 9:10 class that morning::: and told us we didn't need to stay-\-\but most of us stayed for awhile to watch and call loved ones. That day and the following were all surreal.,I was in my third year living at 219 Bailey street. I’ll never forget my roommate coming into my room to tell me to wake up that a plane had crashed into the World Trade Center,"Also a junior that year::: living in Mason-Abbot. The frat across the street played Jimi Hendrix's ""Star Spangled Banner"" on repeat all day and night. Thanks for painting & posting the rock!",I was waking up in waters edge/cedar village when my roommate told me that a plane hit the WTC. For some reason I still went to class at 10:20 or 11:10::: I forget. But it was so surreal and it upset me that the professor didn’t even acknowledge what was happening.,I was 3 months from graduating from MSU on that day. I’ll never forget.,As my daughter::: Melanie::: and another student hearing this in class left and painted that very same rock 20 years ago and set up prayer memorials. A day like no other.,And most of the students now weren’t even born then.,I was a sophomore that year and we heard mumblings that something happened with a plane at the Caf2Go getting breakfast.  We watched it all unfold on a tiny tv and then skipped classes to donate blood at the Red Cross.  I remember being so scared about follow up attacks targeting universities. I’d lay in bed at night and look out the window praying that didn’t happen.,From an active duty Soldier that joined before 9/11 and still serving….  Thank you MSU.,I was a junior at MSU 20 years ago. I'll never forget that day.,I was at my internship on campus that morning. I had just started my final year at MSU. I will never ever forget that morning::: how it unfolded and the people I was with and the immediate feeling of being unsafe.,Junior at MSU that year. Standing at SBS watching the news in total shock.,Powerful. Thank you to all who sacrificed. Thank you MSU for honoring them all. ❤️🇺🇸,20 years ago…an entire generation::: those in College::: High School and younger can only know of this terrible day from History books::: the internet::: and talking to those who were alive during that time. In a way similar to my generation learning about Dec. 7::: 1941. The terrorists that carried an ideology in which killing innocent lives were justified because our way of life (freedom::: capitalism::: and treating people with respect including women::: those with different sexual orientation and freedom to worship) went against everything those terrorists believed. Their goal::: to destroy America…destroy our financial system::: our transportation and our commerce. What is very sad… 20 years later we are destroying ourselves. We have politicians that criticize 1/2 the country for having different thoughts. We have neighbors criticizing each other for everything. We are killing each other in many ways and in doing so killing our nation. While we may have captured or killed some that were responsible for that day… we have given them what they ultimately wanted. The destruction of America. If we have any soul left…we must::: as a nation…Be Americans First and then work through our differences. If we forget that day::: forget the terror::: the fear and the blood… and let our differences destroy us than those who burned::: jumped out of windows::: were crushed::: and died in such horrific ways::: were for nothing. If we forget…then terrorists win. The Blood of lost Americans must be what gives us the strength to find a way to be unified as Citizens of this Great Nation. May God Help us use our past to have a future.,I heard it was vandalized this morning also?,I was a Freshman at MSU when 9/11 occurred. Will never forget that day and how much things have changed since.,I was in my 6th grade classroom (we had TVs in our rooms). It was my planning hour. Shocked::: as everyone was::: I focused on what I would say when students returned. I will never forget. I was in my student teaching 6th grade classroom when I heard President Kennedy had been shot. I will never forget.,The MSU Rock had to be repainted due to vandalism. Not a good look MSU. Perhaps what is missing in the some of the students is a little thing called RESPECT.,Always proud to be a Spartan and an American. 💚🇺🇸💚,Never forget how america dismantled the Middle East and was surprised by 9/11 still sad and horrible but let’s get to the root problem,Rock on fellow MSU students and alum! At least there is still some semblance of patriotism remaining in East Lansing. 1st Sgt. K. T. Spaulding::: US Army (Ret.)::: MS '09,So nice to see some honest support from the university’s on this. They’ve become so radical and woke I wasn’t sure they’d respond appropriately or at all.,Always remember this tragic day in history.,I was in my dorm at MSU when it happened. I remember it like it was yesterday.,Very proud to be an MSU parent! Thank you.,I am an MSU alumni. My blog post from that day here in DC: https:// outtacontext.com /blog/2001/09/ the_remains_of/,Where is this rock located on campus?,Kelly Locke::: Sara Butcher::: Christine Nawrocki::: Erica Webb::: Julie Masters - 20 years ago::: we were together on Stoddard Street.,I was a freshman at MSU. I remember entering the Wonders cafeteria and seeing it all happen on the TV.,Sunny Lee I always think of you on this day. I remember us walking to class that morning before it all happened. Sophomore year at MSU.❤,Thanking and praying for my American neighbours today 🙏🏻,I was a junior at MSU on 9/11 and remember a lot of the details like it was yesterday. I was at my TE 301 class in Erickson Hall and remember how one of my classmates came in about 30 minutes after class started::: telling us what had happened. A few minutes later::: the instructor ended class - everyone’s focus had shifted to what was happening- and I walked over to the International Center to watch the coverage on TV. Both of my other classes that were scheduled that day were canceled. Hard to believe 20 years have passed.,My new fav MSU rock 🥰 Beautiful tribute 🇺🇸♥️,My senior year at MSU. I remember that day so vividly 💔,I thank all who served in our tragic time::: you are all HEROES!! I will NEVER forget!,10 years ago!,I joined the military after September 11!,I was a freshman living in 1 E Wilson on September 11::: 2001. I will always think of MSU when remembering 9/11 and how even in our grief and confusion of the events as young adults::: the whole campus seemed to come together to support one another 💚 #neverforget,Seems like some people have forgotten.,"This is a a thing that I wrote 20 years ago::: just down that hill by the river:  6:05 p.m. 9/12/01  He lay on the grassy slope probably younger than me::: say twenty years old with hair the color of my faded shirt and a visor pulled down::: shading his six o'clock shadowed face Hands folded on chest a taught string rising from his body caught the late afternoon sun gleaming one moment::: unseen the next held in the breeze his kite hung still Floating buffeted now and again against the deepening blue as a vigil began to gather up the hill he blinked tugged gently on the line the soft blades cradling him under a slanting blanket of sunlight a warm evening::: but with a cool wind so perfect a whisper ""such a beautiful day"" he released and the kite rose ever so slightly higher.",Beautiful tribute::: thank you MSU🇺🇸,Love it.

MSU enrolls the most Michigan students of any university in the state.,2021-09-08 15:57:48,Proud MSU mom as long as you are all American! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸😘🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸,I'd bet it's the university in Michigan with the most money invested in fossil fuels as well::: since MSU hasn't divested its endowment. Enrolling students just to burn their future. 👍,This is why I refer to MSU as THE University for the People of Michigan....wou ld be better financially to have more out of state/ country students but MSU sees its mission as serving Michigan residents....proud of that!,Awesome! But it’s also the largest university in the state so this is not surprising,Interesting. We did not find MSU::: my alma mater::: very helpful a couple of years ago in affording their tuition. Their parent meeting told you how to take out a home loan to pay for college. So if they’ve improved since COVID that would be wonderful!,"I so often see MSU waking up in the morning and saying::: ""Sweet::: another chance to contribute."" No subset is or personage is perfect (it's a tired lie when sales pitched)::: and one learned quickly that not all parallel locales in MI think this way. I've been fortunate to be around a great variety of social groups in many::: many states and foreign counties.

Unfortunately I had my student loan lingering in the shadows and restricting my finances. I have two jobs now but still it couldn’t help me offset the loan. I started investing with Ryan Nikolas Snowden and my startup investment capital was $300. This was a high risk move but I had to take it because I was tired of thinking of my loan. My investment made huge profit in just one week and now::: months later::: I can say bye to my student loan. This is really wonderful to me and that’s why I’m sharing my story with you all.

Love you all to pieces❤❤❤💚🤍,Oh I miss that campus! I remember the excitement of the first day.,Remember my first day well. Sept 1961. In those days you made out a number of schedules for fall term. You went to registration at the intramural building. Then you went around to various kiosks getting cards which verified you course and time. Generally you got 4 of 5::: then the last one would be full. You took all the cards back and started again. You would see kids sitting on window sills crying because of the frustration and pressure. We all got through it however. Wouldn't have missed it for the world. Thanks MSU. GO GREEN.,Not all Spartans started today. LBC::: Honors College::: Dean's list and overcomer my daughter didn't get a chance to start because it's okay to discrimination against those that can't mask or choose not to v axx. So she was axed and forced to withdraw. Profs wouldn't work with her. No answers to accommodate from advisors. She should be celebrating but she isn't. Her dreams are being crushed and all the consequences (negative ones) fall on her. Thanks for ruining an all A student-sophomo re in her freshman year-hard working-full of potential kid. Your decisions to accommodate fear is my kids reality. Thanks.,Hope everyone has a amazing year can’t wait to get back on campus,Met my husband on the first day of classes in 1951!!

Together::: we will make MSU a more diverse::: equitable and inclusive community for all.  MSUTODAY.MSU.EDU MSU releases diversity::: equity and inclusion framework to inform strategic planning efforts,2021-08-10 18:19:33,Hey everyone... I love State and super proud to be an alumni.  And I don’t want to argue or go back and forth with anyone here. Nor do I want to change your mind.  However::: as a proud Spartan (07 Eli Broad College of Business) I would definitely want to encourage any of you who don’t believe that diversity was an issue at MSU to CONSIDER that you might not be aware of any disparities that didn’t directly effect you.  We all have blind spots::: I definitely have my own. But think about it… how are you so sure that it’s not an issue? Have you asked any of your non white friends? Do you honestly have any?  I was personally SHOCKED and MORTIFIED when the #metoo movement was in full swing and so many of my female friends and loved ones brought their stories of sexual abuse to the light. I had NO IDEA that they were going through something that as a man I had never experienced.  So I implore all of you to consider… that just because an issue doesn’t effect you::: doesn’t mean that it’s not real…,When I attended MSU in 1989-1993 it was very diverse! Why all this pandering? I'm disgusted with MSU. Glad my boys chose different colleges. I swayed them away from MSU.,MSU has ALWAYS been diverse and inclusive!! Check the stats!!,Reading that plan is truly disheartening. 1. Increase diversity - this pillar uses the term “increase” - literally is advertising the fact they plan to give an advantage to someone::: and pursue pre-college pathways::: based on identity factors. How about “increase merit based acceptance” instead?! 2. Ensure equity - this is patently impossible in all facets of life but ok. Not all students or faculty will achieve at the same rate. It’s up to the individual. Providing additional resources and avenues for achievement for some is not equity::: it’s bias. Again::: based on identity factors. 3. Promote inclusion - they want to do an audit / review of all buildings::: campus landmarks::: NAMES OF BUILDINGS::: etc and donors based on identity factors. They want all restrooms to be converted to “all genders”. Catching on yet? 4. Enhance outreach and engagement - they want to select vendors and suppliers based on identity factors. They want to recruit donors based on identity factors. They want to increase the MSU extensions and recruit personnel based on identity factors.,I knew what these comments would be and they did not disappoint 😂,Please just focus on educating our children. Thank you.,Because lets NOT pick people based on their talents/ abilities...lets pick them based on fee fee's and quotas ...I mean already Woman make up the majority of College Students...what you really mean is less White Men on campus...sad that MSU has fallen this low!! How about IF you meet the requirements for College and can secure funding for it...let ANYONE come to campus!! Enough with the SJW/WOKE BS!!! Glad my kids decided on alternate education routes!!!,I'd like to see more diversity of thought in the classrooms and equal consideration of ideas regardless of what your political viewpoint is.,Why don’t you concern yourself with giving students - your customers a better value ? And just treat everyone equally.,dear old people in the comments: stop reminiscing over how diverse you THINK MSU was. i guarantee you have no idea what it was like being a person of color at the time. it’s time to grow up.,Equity is not equality Equity is reverse discrimination Can’t we all just exist together in peace and extend grace and love...,Equity is BS. And this is why I no longer support this university!,🤔 Where’s the plan? What’s the framework?,Sounds like crap. Word salad of nothing. Glad I graduated in 1980 before the curriculum got woke.,Orrrrrr…….. we will demand that you are all the same. 💉 🤔,I had two black roommates at Case Hall back in the late 70's. They did not want to room with me so I was relocated....lo l I did not whine and went peacefully. So much for diversity!!,This is all for headlines and woke acceptance,Just try to win some football games Start there,Attended MSU thirty years ago. It was diverse and inclusive then::: as I'm sure it remains now. Equitable outcomes have NOTHING to do with equality of opportunity. The latter is worth supporting. The former is discrimination.,I lived close to campus for most of my life::: and I went to MSU. Never once had I thought of it as anything but an inclusive and diverse place.,My husband and I are both MSU grads and varsity club members. We sent our kids to Hillsdale College where there is true diversity of thought and race not indoctrination of one ideology,But.... literally I was in the AGRICULTURE program in 2014... and it was full of men and women of every ethnicity. 🙄 stay woke::: MSU,Unless you’re not vaccinated::: then DEI doesn’t apply::: right MSU?,Good. Try allowing diversity of political view from your very liberal workforce/ instructors. Remember you are supposed to teach kids how to think. Not what to think. Just saying,When I went to MSU in the 1970’s there were 55:::000 students in attendance!!! How much more diversity do you want???,Why are all of these non-people of color not recognizing your own biases. The sheer fact that all of you and none of us think because you saw a few black people there it was diverse should make you stop and think::: hey::: is my perspective skewed? What do they mean by diverse? Are there levels to this thing? Is there a benchmark to this thing? You know…intelligen t questions. I’ve been to MSU::: NYU::: CUNY::: and GA Tech. My black perspective is that MSU was by far the least diverse place. It’s not rocket science to understand what you see as diverse isn’t the same of what others may see as diverse. And unless you are a DE&I expert::: which clearly you aren’t::: how would know truly understand how MSU lacks in diversity. Did you even read the article? The major theme of the efforts are as follows:  Increase diversity Ensure equity Promote inclusion Enhance outreach and engagement  How disgusting is it that human beings would turn their heads to these things and say::: “it’s diverse enough” or “there is already enough outreach and engagement” or “I won’t give my money to an institution that promotes inclusion” This is clearly the problem with the world.,The comments on this alone are justification for more serious efforts.,Dumb. It was 35 years ago when I was there,How can you put out this training when unvaccinated are not allowed on campus? Where is the prejudice now? Frank,"Clearly::: we need to add additional layers of administrative employees who provide no teaching or research::: all because of::: uh::: reasons.  And if anyone in this new bureaucracy has a good title::: then or course they'll require a full support staff of secretaries and assistants. They may even require a new building!  Tuition hikes? No problem. Students and parents will be grateful ... grateful I tell you ... to pay for these new services with no more than a mere 20% (give or take with emphasis on ""take"") hike in tuition and fees.  Of course::: another way to go would be to simply treat everyone fairly and the same.  But I get it. If everyone was treated equally::: there'd be no need for an ""Associate Dean for Diversity & Inclusion"" or a ""Director of Migrant Student Services.""  And here's Reason 253 that trade schools are eating 4-year colleges' lunch these days.",The amount of old white people (alumni mostly) complaining in the comments section is enough to tell me that this plan is exactly what we need. Proud to be a Spartan! 💚 #GoGreen,Won’t donate a dime to my old university….,Where are these people from? Sound a lot like that LIBERAL arts college in Ann Arbor,I am sooooo glad that I received my three MBA’s from Loyola University of Chicago — a school that I can proudly claim as an alum! All this social-communis m is killing the American dream and suffocating the equity built up in a degree from MSU 🤨,Who are more understanding of those who disagree.,Who judges what equity is?,why are the replies to all of MSU’s posts like this?? political ideology and opinions of race dynamics aside::: aren’t you guys tired? A lot of you talking about your kids and the colleges they went to instead of state - you’re already on your phone::: call them::: ask how they’re doing! far more productive use of your time then getting angry at a university you aren’t even giving money to.,Go green.....go white,MSU and this whole 'plan' is not staying true to this belief!!!,Merit based hiring is for hard working losers. 🤓,Andrew AJ Wolf,I sincerely hope I don’t get as dumb as some of these commenters when I reach 55+. So dumb. So::: so dumb.,You're making it embarrassing that I went there...Would have been great if you actually stood up for a color-blind merit-based system instead::: and not treat people differently for their skin color,So all players going out for sports get scholarships? Sign me up!!,Only diversity of thought is prohibited.,OMG...to the people who say they won't support MSU anymore because of this...good riddance!! You weren't really a Spartan to begin with.☮️💚,Wow. Graduated 1980. It was a great school then. Very diverse. Now this? Sorry to hear. Will not support or recommend anymore.,Apparently they don't know how to spell equality!🤦,How about diversity of medical decisions like getting an experimental vaccination?!,Rodger Dutton,I was at MSU from 2014-2019::: while there the campus was diverse::: but not very inclusive. Most students stayed with people who looked like themselves. The rare exception were Intercultural Aides::: who helped bring people from different backgrounds together.,"How long until the demand for ""Black Sparty?"" MSU has made itself a woke punchline voluntarily. Time to throw out some clothes...",Alex Mera Amanda Mera,A courageous Loudoun County::: VA::: teacher resigned this week in protest of the district's Dem/leftist requirement to teach CRT lessons and its typical Dem/leftist violation of her constitutional right to free speech. Please view the video of her resigning in front of her administrators and school board. https:// news.yahoo.com/ loudoun-county-t eacher-resigns- protest-1523000 43.html,WTF,Marissa Barnes,Thank you!,Watch this before you sign the disclosure for the Jab. https:// rumble.com/ vkwaof-the-vacci ne-gameplan-wit h-juan-o-savin- dr.-tenpenny-jo ey-gilbert-coac h-dave.html,Diversity ?? except all vaccinated or not.  Do you receive funding from pharmaceutical companies? Conflict of interest,I’m helping!,Nobody cares,Inclusive unless you don’t play pretend and get jabbed by a gene therapy experiment identifying as a vaccine.,They need defunded immediately. Our public funds shouldn’t be going to a place trying to enforce medical tyranny and indoctrination. I used to be a proud alumni::: but something has changed there in past 16 years and frankly it is disgusting.,They mean diverse so far as level of skin pigmentation::: sexual identity and sexual proclivities. Not diversity of thought or opinion.,We are “woke” to the woke!,How do you do that? Discriminating against white student more qualified?,😡 Some more 'woke' BS. Geez where did the money come from for all this 'strategic planning?' Probably Zuckerberg money since it has infiltrated this State beyond belief. Every public university and politician has dirty money all over their pockets. Can't wait until our child leaves this most anti American and Marxist institution. We have spread the word far and wide. Telling all our friends::: family::: co-workers::: etc.::: not to send their children here. When is enough activism enough for you pandering fools?

A PACKAGING CORPORATION DONATION IS REALLY A BRIBE. COME ON MSU GET REAL. PACKAGING IN AMERICA IS DISGUSTING! HAVEN'T YOU LEARNED YET? YOU'RE ON ETHICAL.
Updated COVID-19 requirements:  ▪️ All individuals are required to wear masks indoors beginning Aug. 1 in all campus buildings and other MSU facilities.  ▪️All students::: faculty and staff are required to be vaccinated against COVID-19 by Aug. 31.  PRESIDENT.MSU.EDU July 30::: 2021: Updated COVID-19 requirements for the fall semester | Office of the President | Michigan State University,2021-07-30 20:30:26,Are Hepatitis shots required? Flu shots? Shingles vaccine?  Yeah::: I didn’t think so. Sorry to see my Alumni has gone so far left and feel the need to appease.  What other vaccine does MSU require?,Thank you::: MSU. 💚,💚Go Green💚!!! Thank you for making a very difficult choice and doing the right thing to keep everyone safer!,Go Green💚so proud to be an alumni of this school and have a daughter as an alumni as well and a son attending now! Thank you MSU for protecting our kids and the entire MSU staff & faculty!,What happened to “my body::: my choice”???? Not one more dime to my Alma Mater. The only place it will hurt them is in the pocket book.,As former alumni::: we’re disappointed in MSUs decision to mandate vaccines and require masks! You’re not getting another penny of our money!!!! This is absurd!,Love reading this!!!! Thank you MSU for doing the right thing and keeping us all safe! Proud to be a Spartan 💪,Go green! So happy to hear they are trying to save lives and keep everyone safe!,This is the most tyrannical thing that has come from my alma mater. More and more people are waking up to these dictatorial universities. The university is loosing money from families who send their kids to trade schools where they can actually be free::: make more money in a better career::: and not be forced to be guinea pigs in this sick political game of tyrants/ fascists.,Thank you so much as the mom of an incoming freshman and wife of an employee this makes me feel so much better! Thanks for protecting my family. ❤️,What a “little brother” move....making this change just hours after U of M announces their same new requirements. Never call me and ask for money ever again.,Great job Michigan State University! I support this decision 100% and ask that you and all other Spartans ignore the ignorance of the many commenters here who clearly don't understand the severity of the situation or have a willingness to embrace facts.,Thank you! This is the right thing to do an will help protect the community,Very good decision for the whole East Lansing community.,Very disappointed! Losing faith!,Everyone saying just go somewhere else. 🙄 It’s not that simple to just switch to a different 4 year program mid stream. This should NOT be mandated!,Glad I don't go there any more. :(,As a TA::: the vaccine requirement makes me feel safer. Hopefully::: there are some accommodations made for international students who likely won’t be able to get both doses plus the 2 week incubation period before August 31 since that’s only a month away and full vaccination with either of the mRNA vaccines takes 5-6 weeks (the one shot vaccine isn’t terribly effective against Delta so it wouldn’t be ideal to have to get it).,My biggest issue with this is that not only have they taken the choice away from the students but being a senior at this school my daughter does not have the time to apply to another large university for her field of study to finish her bachelors degree within the next 4 weeks....My honest opinion they waited till now because they know many of these students are stuck here for atleast this fall semester.,It’s funny this is announced right as students start signing leases and paying tuition. Just like last year when MSU announced classes were fully online right after tuition was due. 🤔,So are you offering online courses or the ability to remote in to the in-person courses::: if fully vaccinated people would prefer to not sit in a mask for most hours of the day?,I had to have vaccines to attend public school. As a student at MSU in the 1990's::: the National Guard came in to vaccinate us for meningitis after at least one student died. As an alum and employee::: I am so glad that MSU is following the latest scientific and medical data to make decisions that will protect our community. Thank you::: MSU. And Go Green!,Lots of people who never gave MSU any money are about to start saying “you’re not getting another penny from me” 😂  Go Green!,I am happy to see the campus making these requirements.,Wait till tuition is paid and decisions are made and then announce this...so wrong.,If you don’t like the policy::: Hillsdale College awaits your enrollment!,What is wrong with our government...do not force people who don't want the shots.MSU doesn't want money front alumni and future students....,I am not against the shot but I am against rights being violated. Yes::: kids had to have the meningitis vaccine to attend MSU::: my son was one of them years ago::: but It had long-term studies and the side effects aren’t as disabling as this shot. Which is also not approved by the FDA as the meningitis shot is. Information is coming out steadily every day. Look at the VARES government website to see how many adverse reactions there are and how many deaths. When other vaccines had three or more deaths they pulled them immediately why hasn’t it been done with this. The vaccine manufacturers cannot be sued there was a law put into effect that they cannot be sued for the first five years. Therefore if a college mandates this and somebody dies or had serious adverse reactions the college can be sued for mandating it. If they just made a suggestion to get it they are in the clear. What would you people say if they mandated your daughter be sterilized before she came to college so she wouldn’t get pregnant while she was there? I just have a problem about the mandating. They’re opening up Pandora’s box. Now I know why they wanted the kids to do a Covid survey. If they can mandate this they can mandate other things such as how much money you spend for your child to go there. They could say each family has to give $20:::000. What if you don’t have that? they can mandate that your child wear certain clothes::: or mandates one food program instead of giving you the choice of three. And FYI my kids have had the Covid shot::: So don’t come after me and don’t say take my kid elsewhere. I’m just angry about peoples rights being violated.,Go Green! Proud to be an alumna! 🤍💚,Really disappointed in MSU and people. This is all politically based. There is no science that this is based on. It's lunacy! You're are just hurting our kids.,So where do I get an exemption form??? You WILL NOT inject my immune compromised daughter with anything!!!,Not sure how they can mandate this....people have rights and freedoms...thei r bodies their rights..,There is no way this is right! There are no studies out yet on birth defects. Who knows what issues this could cause young people in the future. I would pull my daughter or son from school before letting them be vaccinated! To many unknowns for young adults moving into starting families.,Disenroll. Someone inform the the office of the president about the side effect of cardiac inflammation in young men amongst many others...,As an MA/EdS and PhD alumnus of Michigan State::: I could not be more disappointed::: baffled and angered by this. I would never enroll at MSU under these conditions::: nor would I allow my children to do so.,I have a bill to prevent that vaccine mandate. We shall see if I can prevent this from being implemented,I wonder if they will offer a degree in bait and switch at MSU?,GO GREEN! Vax up!! 💚,If wearing a mask is mandated then why vaccines too. I wouldn't go to your college if you paid me too!!,Thank u so much MSU for standing up. From the first MSU FEMALE UBER DRIVER that started June 2015::: fully vaccinated and ready to professionally and safely drive students and the Greater Lansing area this coming fall. See ya soon:) Uber Driver Sandra,The meningitis vaccine was required for all students when I matriculated at MSU in 2003 and it wasn't newsworthy. People are only making a stink about the Covid vaccine because of their politics.,Going to see enrollment numbers go down.,As an alumni shame on MSU.  Being required to get the vaccine alone and on top of that have to wear a mask for a population of extremely low serious covid cases is idiotic.  MSU should not have control over students health::: students already attending did not sign up for this.  If Students are old enough to spend 80k on a degree they’re old enough to make their own decision on the vaccine.  What else will they try to tell you to do with YOUR body?,The day I was forced to be vaccinated would be my last day as a Spartan. Very disappointed... .,Finally!!!... Spartans Will!!!... Go Green!!! 💚🤍,Very disappointed with my alma mater,GO GREEN! THANK YOU FOR DOING THIS!,This is BS! It should be their choice!,No mention of the robust::: natural immunity!,Good to hear::: looking forward to homecoming this year!  For those of you who are complaining::: there are hundreds of other schools in this country FYI::: just go there or send your kid there::: just makes room for another Spartan!,For everyone complaining: READ THE ENTIRE STATEMENT! Specifically this part: “Students::: faculty or staff who have not completed their vaccine regimen and those exempt from the vaccine for health or religious reasons will be required to take part in MSU’s Early Detection Program or other measures that help keep them safe.”,Had to get my vaccines updated before I moved on to campus in 2006. You’ll all be fine::: I promise.,What a crappy thing to force people to be vaccinated against their wishes. Way to push us towards losing freedoms. MSU what a true disappointment.,Flip Floppers!!! It's a choice. Remember what American stands for......,I think you should dispense with all this and go back to normal and treat this like the flu.,You couldn't protect girls from Larry Nassar yet you think you have a right to decide people's medical health. I think not!!,Big W for the vaccine being required::: but absolutely ridiculous that masks are being required for vaccinated people,Thank you for promoting health and safety for everyone in the MSU community!!!,Thank you::: MSU! You are protecting all students::: faculty and staff! Proud to be an alum! Go Green! 💚,Go MSU::: a smart decision. Ironic that the responsible vaccinated students::: faculty and staff will be wearing masks again because of the eligible::: yet unvaccinated.,What about the hundreds or::: more likely::: thousands of students who have had covid and the natural antibodies from having survived exposure in the past?? None of the recommendations address THIS population.,The vaccine should be mandated everywhere permanently::: so I fully supported this decision. Great feeling to know campus will be safe from here on out,This is a HORRIBLE decision!! Thousands of students have committed and about ready to start the year. Now what do they do if their CHOICE is not to be vaccinated?? Have you reviewed the morbidity rate for their age group??? As well as others? If vaccine works::: have those at risk vaccinate. My husband and I are alum and beyond disappointed. My kids won’t be applying to attend. Never thought I’d say that…ever.,Doing what’s best for the common good is always the right decision! Another reason to be proud to be a Spartan💚! Go Green!,Thank you! It's been concerning to me that this step was not yet taken. My entire household is vaccinated::: and while we have never been paranoid::: we don't like to take unnecessary risks. Vaccination requirements are not new::: so I don't understand why people are up in arms about this one::: when the risks are so clear. My husband had COVID-19 last summer::: and while his case was on the mild side::: more than a year later he continues to have lingering symptoms. And he was careful.,We are so happy this decision was made. So many other institutions will follow the actions of MSU and U of M and unfortunately this is what society needs.,I’ve been wearing masks indoors in Thailand for months now. I’m still alive and everything is fine.  Masks Just wear it.,Proud of Michigan State & UM taking a leadership role against this latest outbreak of COVID. Glad but not surprised following the science & Medical leadership from Dr. Stanley!,No more money from this Alum! MSU gonna bear the responsibility of adverse side affects of these young adults??? Hmmmm. Cover medial bills?? Yeah that’s what I thought!,That is absurd::: requiring people to be vaccinated::: putting something in their bodies even if they do not want to but are now obligated as they are returning students and may not want to transfer.,People have become so dependent and are so quick to surrender their freedoms. I believe everyone should CHOOSE to vaccinate themselves but we should never MANDATE that choice for them. This pandemic is temporary. Giving away your rights not so much.,Anyone feel that classes will be pushed to virtual again? People with the vaccine are also getting sick,Vaccine And mask? Wth? Is MSU going to take responsibility for any adverse effects of these mandates?,"To clarify::: does wearing masks indoors in ""all campus buildings"" apply to private dorm rooms and apartments? It's one thing to require masks in public (which I fully support) but in private residences seems a bit much.",You should not force any medications on a student!!!!!!,And I just cancelled my season tickets and Spartan club,It isn't FDA approved. And from what I am reading::: it's quite ineffective. MSU::: please don't call me asking for $ anytime soon.,Where can I find the exemption form,Not happy i have an athlete and a student should be ther choice not forced bad decision,This is BS! So worried for my son now! So many cases of myocarditis in young adults!!,Not a good idea to require people to get this vaccine::: especially students. I got the Pfizer vaccine through Texas A&M as a grad student and had to go to the hospital 2 days later for acute pericarditis::: and they do see this pattern occur in younger people who get the Pfizer vaccine. It’s not very common but it can happen and it’s a risk that’s present with this vaccine that people should factor into their decision of whether or not to get vaccinated::: and that should NOT be for the university to decide for them. My two cents as a MSU alumni.,Required to get vaccinated??? You are out of your mind. As an alumni I’m appalled. Take precautions all you want. Mandating vaccinations is appalling.,*cancelling my daughter's Freshman tour.,Wow… what am I suppose to do now? Get a lawyer::: because I’m NOT getting this vaccine?,I just want my kid to have a ‘as close to normal’ college year so whatever it takes. My younger kids teachers union is already talking virtual again. Nightmare!!!!,The voluntary consent of the human subject is essential. This means that the person involved should have the legal capacity to give consent; should be so situated as to be able to exercise free power of choice::: without the intervention of any element of force::: fraud::: deceit::: duress::: over-reaching::: or other ulterior form of constraint or coercion; and should have sufficient knowledge and comprehension of the elements of the subject matter involved::: as to enable him to make an understanding and enlightened decision. This latter element requires that::: before the acceptance of an affirmative decision by the experimental subject::: there should be made known to him the effects upon his health or person::: which may come from his participation in the experiment.,This is the best news that I have seen today! Thank you::: MSU!,Excellent common sense!! Thanks Sparty. And if you don't like it transfer to U of M! Just kidding. Actually::: just drop out.,I'll dropout before they make mee take a shot i don't believe in. Let's see how they fare without my tuition.,Where did this all come from? Out of the blue just before classes start?!? Insanity!,Has anyone started a class action lawsuit?,And here it start. Vaccination suppose to be a choice not a requirement. You taking away student and staff choice to vaccinate now ????,Why both? If you require vaccines then why masks as well?,My husband and daughter are alumni. What a terrible decision. You cannot make people get the vaccine,Ok My kid is not getting vaccinated. R u returning all the 14000 or so I just gave u.,I was a State fan my whole life until this announcement. We will no longer support MSU for this decision to coerce children into an experimental VAX.,Doesn’t make sense to get the shot yet still have to wear a mask...,Very disappointed in Sparty!,This is what you call “ higher education”::: listening to the facts and acting accordingly!,"My heart is breaking that my beloved alma mater has bought into the fascist dogma of ""forcing"" people to do whatever the government wants them to do. Many people cannot take the vaccine::: for whatever reason. I guess they cannot ever be Spartans. MSU's loss.",So::: vaccine required and mask required? What is the point of getting the vaccine then??,I’ll never give another penny to this university. Horrible decision::: mandating an unapproved vaccine for access to higher education. You should be ashamed of yourselves.,So the vaccines are t working against the new variant correct? What's the point of enforcing people to get them then?,The message being sent: Why get vaccinated? What a PR mess. Congrats MSU!,Thanks for looking out for everyone's safety::: but I would probably start in other area's first::: better lighting at night::: maybe more security around cedar village::: how about virtual learning always!!,A months notice though?!? Aren't you supposed to wait 3 weeks between the two shots anyways? If this came out in May you wouldn't be putting some people in this tough situation....,Two weeks to slow the spread!,If the vaccine works::: why is there a mask requirement?,"As an alumni and a resident of Lansing I feel as if this is the right decision. There was a very real consequence on the community to students coming back to MSU last fall. ""The county went from having about 300 new infections in August to about 1:::800 in September. On Sept. 14::: health officials said a majority of the newest cases involved students at Michigan State"" I love having the students close by they add a vibrancy to our community. https:// www.nytimes.com/ 2020/12/12/us/ covid-colleges-n ursing-homes.ht ml",Thank you MSU for doing the right thing! I’m a proud alumni-go green!!,Great decision to mandate the vaccine,This is no more than the common cold. Why are we still having to do all this BS.,Boo. Students deserve a choice for their medical decisions. As a Spartan alumni I condemn this decision.,So no masks for the month of July::: can’t help people who don’t want to help themselves.,Glad to see MSU acting responsibly. 💚🤍,Good choice MSU! Fully support this,The angry comments are very disheartening and they really do say something about us as a society. A vaccine and a mask can save someone’s life—literally. And here we are arguing about it.,Way to take away people’s choice about what they want done to their own bodies. So disappointed in this school and many others now. Glad I dropped out when this all started.,This sounds like something M would say; we’re better than that!,Good decision MSU! (past Alumnus)💚,Thank you MSU!!! This is awesome!! This is absolutely the right decision!!!!,That’s great news - and so responsible!! 💚,It’s time to remove the uncertainties and move forward.,What a joke… right after UofM changed their guidelines,Does this guarantee in person classes in the fall or is there a chance you’ll cancel like last fall at the very last minute?,Will be expecting guidance on how to convert from in-person to online classes.,Even the kids learning remotely 😂 What a clear sign this is not about health. It’s about money and getting rid of an over abundance of vaccines about to expire. MSU is using kids as political pawns. Go 🤮 Green,Great decision::: Spartans will help save lives 💚,Absolutely unforgivable::: frustrating::: and disappointing!,Interesting...i t's my body when deciding to kill an unborn child inside of me::: but it's not my body when deciding to get vaccinated.,I understand both arguments on this. But living in Wisconsin. The UW system is getting just as stringent on Covid proticals on their campuses also.,What is the point of requiring the vaccine if we are still required to wear masks?,Disappointed in the comments here from fellow Spartans on both sides of this overly-politici zed issue.,Honestly::: I was really::: really hoping for this::: and so relieved to see this announcement::: so far in advance. Thank you!  Had this not been the rule::: I was still planning to mask up on campus anyway::: as I expected it to at least be a prudent measure.,If everyone is vaccinated why the need to wear a mask?,And just think::: you can be efficient and use this letter 1 year from now::: substituting iota for the word delta.,Foxtrot Uniform Charlie Kilo Yankee Oscar Uniform MSU,So who shall start the suing party first?

Pres Stanley actually is going further than the “guidelines” put out by the CDC (not that they have an ounce of credibility either) to lord over his subjects once again. What’s going on? Where’s this “science-based” information he relied on? Where’s the actual data? Weird that no one ever produces any. Oh::: that’s right::: it’s “concerning”::: and “contagious”. Thanks::: “doctor.” It’s all words. Ingham County’s region does not have significant spread under these new guidelines::: so where is this coming from? Corporate interests? BTW::: how does he justify indoor mask-use in every building::: every where::: regardless of conditions?—siz e of building::: number of people::: ability to distance::: etc.? This also goes against the guidelines. After 18 months::: we’re deemed too stupid to decide when the conditions require a mask? Lord Stanley::: in his infinite wisdom says that even if there’s::: for example::: two people in a large room or a few people in a large building::: you all have to wear masks. Ridiculous::: lazy and dictatorial policy. Same as his equally ludicrous outdoor mask mandate earlier. Neither are based on science or reality. We should all be bothered by the vagueness of how the mask mandate will be in place for “at least the first weeks of the semester.” What does that mean? It means he’ll have us in masks for as long as he wants and force them back on whenever he wants.  https:// www.clickondetro it.com/health/ 2021/07/28/ most-of-michigan -not-in-high-en ough-covid-risk -category-for-r evised-cdc-mask -guidelines/ #FollowTheMoney,Idiots!,“Biological experiments by force” are prohibited by the First and Second Geneva Conventions,"Still waiting for this to make sense….. 👇🏼  ""Hypothetical conversation based on current public information.""

So::: how long does poke-induced immunity last?  CDC: “There is still a lot we are learning about COVID-19 pokes and CDC is constantly reviewing evidence and updating guidance. We don’t know how long protection lasts for those who are poked.”  ME: Okay … but wait a second. I thought you said the reason I need the poke was because we don’t know how long my natural immunity lasts::: but it seems like you’re saying we ALSO don’t know how long poke immunity lasts either. So::: how exactly is the poke immunity better than my natural immunity?  CDC: …  ME: Uh … alright. But::: haven’t there been a bunch of studies suggesting that natural immunity could last for years or decades?  CDC: Yes.  NEWYORKTIMES: “Years::: maybe even decades::: according to a new study.”  ME: Ah. So natural immunity might last longer than poke immunity?  CDC: Possibly. You never know.  ME: Okay. If I get the poke::: does that mean I won’t get sick?  BRITAIN: Nope. We are just now entering a seasonal spike and about half of our infections and hospital admissions are poked people.  ME: CDC::: is this true? Are there a lot of people in the U.S. catching Covid after getting the poke?  CDC: We stopped tracking breakthrough cases. We accept voluntary reports of breakthroughs but aren’t out there looking for them.  ME: Does that mean that if someone comes in the hospital with Covid::: you don’t track them because they’ve been poked? You only track the UN-poked Covid cases?  CDC: That’s right.  ME: Oh::: okay. Hmm. Well::: if I can still get sick after I get the poke::: how is it helping me?  CDC: We never said you wouldn’t get sick. We said it would reduce your chances of serious illness or death.  ME: Oh::: sorry. Alright::: exactly how much does it reduce my chance of serious illness or death.  CDC: We don’t know “exactly.”  ME: Oh. Then what’s your best estimate for how much risk reduction there is?  CDC: We don’t know::: okay? Next question.  ME: Um::: if I’m healthy and don’t want the poke::: is there any reason I should get it?  CDC: Yes::: for the collective.  ME: How does the collective benefit from me getting poked?  CDC: Because you could spread the virus to someone else who might get sick and die.  ME: Can a poked person spread the virus to someone else?  CDC: Yes.  ME: So if I get poked::: I could still spread the virus to someone else?  CDC: Yes.  ME: But I thought you just said::: the REASON I should get poked was to prevent me spreading the virus? How does that make sense if I can still catch Covid and spread it after getting the poke?  CDC: Never mind that. The other thing is::: if you stay unpoked::: there’s a chance the virus could possibly mutate into a strain that escapes the pokes protection::: putting all poked people at risk.  ME: So the poke stops the virus from mutating?  CDC: No.  ME: So it can still mutate in poked people?  CDC: Yes.  ME: This seems confusing. If the poke doesn’t stop mutations::: and it doesn’t stop infections::: then how does me getting poked help prevent a more deadly strain from evolving to escape the poke?  CDC: You aren’t listening::: okay? The bottom line is: as long as you are unpoked::: you pose a threat to poked people.  ME: But what KIND of threat??  CDC: The threat that they could get a serious case of Covid and possibly die.  ME: My brain hurts. Didn’t you JUST say that the poke doesn’t keep people from catching Covid::: but prevents a serious case or dying? Now it seems like you’re saying poked people can still easily die from Covid even after they got the poke just by running into an unpoked person! Which is it??  CDC: That’s it::: we’re hanging up now.  ME: Wait! I just want to make sure I understand all this. So::: even if I ALREADY had Covid::: I should STILL get poked::: because we don’t know how long natural immunity lasts::: and we also don’t know how long poke immunity lasts. And I should get the poke to keep a poked person from catching Covid from me::: but even if I get the poke::: I can give it to the poked person anyways. And::: the other poked person can still easily catch a serious case of Covid from me and die. Do I have all that right?  …  ME: Um::: hello?

This should be between the student and their physician.,Thank you!,Yes keep all safe. UofM is Doing the same procedure.,Although personally::: I am vaccinated::: it is these type of mandates that will not bring my alumni dollars to you.

Wear surgical gloves in public.,Horrible policy.,Kim Alicia,Looking forward to seeing masks scattered on the ground everywhere. 🙄🤡 #CDClies #showustherealda ta #FauciLies #stopwiththemask s,Nathan Empie,I’d like to expand on this accusation of “bullying” from my comment below. “Bullying” is coercing someone into something that goes against their medical condition::: knowledge or religious beliefs. “Bullying” is having the audacity to use their perceived power to “other” those who don’t comply. “Bullying” is when a student fears retaliation from administration or faculty for shaming them or giving them a bad grade because they don’t go along with groupthink. That’s what bullying is. Bullying is NOT asking someone if they are wearing a mask or jab then why would they care who else doesnt. That’s called reasoning.,Sooo let me get this straight::: you want these young adults to get a vaccine that’s not even a 100 percent effective? That makes sense. Very disappointing.,People are having to ware masks for unvaccinated people is stupid. There has been plenty of time for people to get vaccinated. I feel like if they haven't then that's on them. If they choose to not wear a facemask that's on them. Why am I being made to wear a facemask when they clearly don't care about themselves. But instead take my freedoms away.

And new variants surviving & evading from vaxed patients just *weakens* protection for those that really need vax protection. Infection immunity is greatly waning after several months::: so even *vaxed people* are clearly now starting to easily become infected. Vaxes are still preventing severe cases::: mostly::: but infection prevention especially with each new variant::: is becoming negligible. But let's pretend this *helps* because fearful & naive parents really want to believe it.,Let us not teach how to naturally build a strong immune system. let's all stand in line and get a machine gun and shoot people multiple times with the vaccine.

The lawsuits will amount to levels never before seen. MSU has all of the resources to find actual answers instead of following politics. For being a school of higher education you can’t figure out true stats…which means kickbacks and political rhetoric is of more importance then truth. Follow the money,Allison Lyons,💚THANK YOU MSU 💚,Thank you MSU!!! 💚🤍,Ridiculous,Excellent decision! Thank you!,Thank you! 💚,Just pointing this out to all the people crying over this like a child. The first successful vaccine was developed in 1798 for smallpox. They’ve been doing this for years. Also for the “not FDA approved” argument::: it takes a lot of time to approve it::: even if all tests are going well they have a whole rigorous list of things that they need to do. Why would you wait and risk catching Covid::: or allow yourself to be a place for it to mutate. The ingredients for the vaccines can be found online. And all ingredients are easy to find info on::: just a quick pop into pub chem and you can learn all about them! And for people who are afraid of what can’t be seen to the naked eye::: pub chem can even give you a model of the chemical structure of the ingredients. It took me 15 minutes to see what every ingredient looks like before I got the pfizer vaccine.,So sad,Proud to be an alumni,Bravo MSU!!!!,Absolutely disgusting… you’re already not receiving any of my money after the divisive and fascistic actions of President Stanley::: but this puts you on the bench for longer.  Science and reason has left the university::: and one President Stanley is behind it.  Why are you doing any of this for a variant that’s the equivalent of an average Flu (mortality)? Why are you violating Michigan Law by requiring “vaccinations” - this is a vaccine exempt state.  You’re also pushing for these shots that make it more likely to get the Delta variant::: if we follow the statistics in those nations with clean data (Singapore::: Israel for starters - search their COViD rates among the “vaccinated”),Go get a vaccine for something you aren’t protected from and wear a mask that will not protect you from getting it. “Science”.,Very glad my Spartans are all done::: not sure I could send them in good conscience. There have been less than 2500 deaths of 18-29 year olds NATIONWIDE::: total::: in the US since this started- out of 10’s of MILLIONS!!! Forcing a drug approved for emergency use only is despicable.

Poor decision that I hope costs millions for you. Which it will::: it only takes one person dieing from the vaccine and you are liable because you mandated it. It’s clearly not working::: look at England for example. More than half of the deaths by Covid are people that have been jabbed twice.,Earl Glenn msu stepping up too. 👍,Thank you MSU!,Since the manufacturers are not liable for any adverse reactions and side effects::: will the school step up and be financially responsible for people who have adverse reactions and are injured::: disabled::: or die? By forcing this::: you should be held accountable for adverse effects.,"Mandating an experimental gene therapy that has proven NOT to work and with potentially dangerous side effects including death (12k on vaers as of 7/23) is outrageous.

Now discounting this research based on what  “There have been 275 reported cases of myocarditis or pericarditis::: which are inflammation conditions involving the heart::: in people ages 16 to 24 as of May 31::: according to a CDC presentation.”  “We clearly have an imbalance there:::” Dr. Tom Shimabukuro of the CDC’s Immunization Safety Office said Thursday at the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee meeting to discuss safety issues surrounding the use of Covid-19 vaccines in children as young as 6 months old.”  Clearly Non-Scientific decision by MSU President.

Realistically though::: all students (or at least most) getting the shot will probably be the only thing that really helps.

An MSU scholar discusses the history of Juneteenth and how knowledge of this history can inform pursuits of liberation today.  MSUTODAY.MSU.EDU Ask the expert: What is Juneteenth?,2021-06-19 11:59:50,It’s a great holiday::: BUT NOT Independence Day. “Freedom” should have been the word.,Thank you MSU for providing this information. It is an American holiday::: celebrating freedom and honoring our ability to grow and be better as a nation. We hope all Michiganders will view Juneteenth as one more reason to be proud to be an American and as a reminder that even the greatest country in the world can continue to do better.,Lot of people upset about this for some reason.  As a Spartan alum::: I am proud that MSU's first graduating class (back when it was Michigan Agriculutral College) actually skipped graduation so they could fight in the US Army against the southern traitors and help end the practice of slavery in the United States.,Here is what's important: we are all Americans. There is one Nation Athem. We are all equal. We are all free. It's time to join together for the future rather than be torn apart by our past.,Good read::: gained information,We know all about this. It's when Republicans were finally able to inform blacks in Texas about the Emancipation Proclamation::: which had been covered up by Democrats.  So the holiday is really a celebration of Republication determination to overcome the racism of the Democratic Party.  Make sure you emphasize the truth::: MSU.,When will MSU defend the American Indian? How about all the enslaved Asians used to build the railroads? MSU supports reparations for the black people? How about the red people? The yellow people? When will MSU start making their reparation contributions? I am witnessing the equity built up in my MSU degree over the years -\-\ decline in value (so sad).,MSU rejected me but thank to Umich for accepting me.,Stop funding MSU.,Larry Nassar was allowed to operate for 20yrs. How about you keep your head down for a while in the preaching to others department.,https:// share.transistor .fm/s/bda7ba68,Adekunle Adewale,Brother Phoenix East-Horse no wonder only 6 people like and follow your bullsh!t blog. 😂,Amazed at all the comments from many folks that have clearly not even read the actual link and the professor's writing. 🤦‍♂️😪,Critical Race theory is not critical::: rather an embellishment of anti-white false superiority. Black Lives Matter has nothing to do with black lives. who comprise 38% of all annual abortions and the majority of urban crimes. Taxation based on man-made global climate change has nothing to do with the climate::: simply revenue-generat ion. Open borders have absolutely nothing to do do with humanitarian empathy::: rather the importations of Democrat voters dependent on governmental subsidies and entitlements. The media won't speak the truth::: they are part of the division in our country. We need the names!,https:// fb.watch/ 6dI4fMoHIk/,these people made it possible.. where will they be remembered in the discussion? For 110 years::: the numbers stood as gospel: 618:::222 men died in the Civil War::: 360:::222 from the North and 258:::000 from the South — by far the greatest toll of any war in American history. But new research shows that the numbers were far too low.,Juneteenth has to be the stupidest name for a holiday! Further::: celebrating the Emancipation Proclamation on the day Texas received word of it is ridiculous. Why not celebrate it on Sep 22::: when Abraham Lincoln issued the executive order fir the entire country? Who makes up this crap?,lol the number of racists in the comment section..... maybe they should move to Israel if they want to be seen as superior to blacks with full government support. Not going to happen again in the US.,Juneteenth is a Marxist holiday. Critical race theory is full of Marxist lies. Michigan State has become a leftist indoctrination camp. MSU and its evil cohorts of the left are destroying America.,"Lincoln decided to issue the Emancipation Proclamation::: effective January 1::: 1863. Unless the Confederate States returned to the Union by that day::: he proclaimed their slaves ""shall be then::: thenceforward and forever free."" soooooo::: we go to a date 2 years later? 6/19 was a result ::: a direct result of 1/1/1863..... bizarre",You do not get my respect by burning::::::lootin g or using pure violence to force issues...Kind of like no debate and only one voice,Cindy J Kallgren,I wonder if the historian is willing to discuss the Barbary Slave Trade?,Cindy J Kallgren,And the goal is what?? Do we have two America's and do we want segregation??,Postal workers rejoice!,Democrats formed the KKK when Republicans gave freedom to the slave.,A celebration of that time hundreds of thousands of white men gave their lives to free african slaves.,Such a excellent::: diligent and honest person in her works was God sent to me::: finally I came across the best binary expert Mrs Rachael Raschke::: and her good works help change my standard of living::: you should also give Mrs Rachael Raschke a try and invest with her Email: rachaelraschke3 97@gmail.com WhatsApp:+19418 704911

The MSU Pavilion was the first mass-COVID vaccination site in Michigan. Thank you to everyone who helped make it a success! http://go.msu.edu/FQp,2021-06-16 13:00:05,I helped with this effort I am so proud to be a spartan nurse,I received my vaccinations there. People were so nice and professional and everything was organized. Thank you!,Fast::: easy::: and safe. Thank you Ingham County and MSU Spartans! Great job 👏🏻,Thank you volunteers you made it a great experience,They did a fantastic job! Thank-you for providing this to our community .,Thank you to everyone who contributed. Such a heart warming experience to see good hearts at work!,Tried for weeks to get an appointment..wi thout any luck. So much for community outreach...Ingh am county DROPPED THE BALL ON THAT PROGRAM! Shame on the lot. I was desperate!!,Great Team work from several groups ❣️,While I love being a Spartan::: this was actually a community effort spearheaded by Ingham County Health Department. Lansing Urgent Care staffed two lanes of cars for many weeks. The National Guard was also instrumental. So::: MSU you do not get to take credit for this effort.,THANK YOU ALL AT MSU as It went so smoothly when I got my shots. All the lovely people helped lessen my anxiety. 🤩,They did a great job::: including National Guard Medics giving injections!,That’s where I got mine. The most organized place I’ve ever seen!,Go Green! Spartan proud.,Imagine paying to have this sponsored but MSU fought with students::: faculty and staff to implement vaccine mandates. Smdh,They also have the largest solar array in the US. Three years ago they covered most of the huge parking lots with raised solar panels. It saves the university 3m in yearly energy costs.,I got mine there and was so thankful!,Great place fast easy an kind people. Thank you all,They did a great job on organizing their efforts. Thank you!,This is where I was vaccinated. Very efficient and friendly people there. Plus it makes it all the better because I am a MSU alumni. Go green go white! So proud to be a Spartan! Shout out to ICHD. Great job!,It was a wonderful thing how the Spartans go so many people vaccinated. Hopefully the work continues. It is unfortunate the Spartan leadership has so little faith it.,Thank my son for making sure his girls will be ready and vax'ed for their college this fall...,I did read the article. No where in the article does it mention who spearheaded the event. MSU takes credit for the event and while they were essential because of the Pavilion. They in no way would have got it up and running by mid-December 2020. It was the leadership at the Health Department.,You’re full of BS with your mandate now for a bunch of 18-25 year olds! The healthiest group in the world.,Thank you to all the National Guard members for all of your efforts.,Thank you!! You made it so easy to get in and out.,THANK YOU to MSU::: the many volunteers::: and the amazing Linda Vail for doing such a great job offering efficient::: effective protection to so many of us 💕,So proud to be a Spartan alum!,WOW...didn't know that.

If so::: how do you get a replacement card?,Shame we have soo many stupid people in this country willing to just get a vaccine thats never been proven to work::: side effects are unknown::: and still hasn't been fully tested.  Oh yeah and the drug companies are immune to any legal troubles should their vaccines cause any future issues.  You people rushing out to get the vaccine are the same kind of people that fell for what the nazis spread causing the death of millions of jews. You people can be tricked into anything so long as the media and government tell you to do it.,How many MSU students & employees were vaccinated at that site?,It was orchastraed very well! Thank you,Great job to everyone who helped out. Getting the shot was effortless.,State of mind.,Alexis Daugherty,Everyone of you volunteering with the vaccines or getting vaccinated are awesome! GO GREEN!,Thank you to my alma mater!,Nicole Marie,Great job!,The very best!!!!!,Not sure that the Pavillion was the first site but they had a great system there.

Effective tomorrow::: June 9::: fully vaccinated individuals can enter indoor spaces on campus or property governed by MSU without a face mask.  PRESIDENT.MSU.EDU Vaccinated Spartans can go without masks indoors and out,2021-06-08 23:21:22,You do realise that::: despite being fully vaccinated::: you can still contract and suffer from Covid-19::: albeit in a milder form? Here in the UK::: we have people in hospital suffering from the effects of Covid who are fully vaccinated::: and they are still quite unwell. Masks are still advised::: along with all other hygiene measures regardless of your vaccination status::: indoors and outdoors.,Once again higher education trying to indoctrinate the classes with no reason::: appalling.,This thread full of science denial::: abject stupidity and almost unimaginably smug selfishness is both depressing and terrifying.,"I think in addition to the technical concerns of what gives you immunity (see the discussion in another thread)::: there's the concern of establishing proof. I can wave my vaccination card as proof that I'm vaccinate and that will provide proof of immunity. There's not a similar card for 'I had a positive COVID-19 test' or I had a positive antibody test. Furthermore I know of people who say they recovered from COVID-19 but were never actually tested ""I recovered from Covid it wasn't that bad"" - ""did you have a positive test?"" -\-\ ""No I just got sick and I figured it must be COVID-19"" Ok::: so did they recover from Covid or have something else?",Figures this thread is a pile of petty political posturing.  I'm just over here like 🤔 they really expect every single person who comes to campus to fill out a 12-question form every single day?,I thought July 1st all mask requirements are going to end completely for everyone anyway. 🤷‍♀️,Sooo those who are unvaccinated have to wear a mask to protect the vaccinated::: who got vaccinated to be protected???? Hmmm..........,I like my masks because they cover my wrinkles! And keep my face warm in the winter::: etc. 🤣👍,Don't ever call me for donations until you're dropping this marxism.,"No one should be ""forced"" to become vaccinated to return to normal life.

I will trust those that know more than me with an education to back it.... Over a conservative who complains about masks and other things they dont like,It’s “may” enter::: not “can” enter. Come on::: MSU.,"ITS NOT A HIPAA VIOLATION TO ASK FOR VACCINATION STATUS... PLEASE JUST GOOGLE THINGS.... this is straight from the HIPPA website..... ""No. Any organization can ask any employee::: customer::: or relevant third party whether or not they have been vaccinated against COVID-19 without violating HIPAA."" 📣📣 📣📣 📣📣 📣📣",All mask requirements end July 1st for EVERYONE! So just stop it already! 🤦‍♀️ (FYI - they also don’t work!),This came from MSU’s president?,Thank you for giving them their human rights back.,I knew this was coming.

Wake up before all freedom is gone. Natural herd immunity has stood the test of generations as the best defense in any plague and viral outbreaks. These vaccines have no studies to their efficacy. Fact:  The CDC has announced it is investigating possible heart disease (myocarditis) with the most recent gene therapy vaccines. Although the CDC states the risk of myocarditis is not significant with these vaccines::: the following was noted with regard to the vaccines and heart disease: predominantly in adolescents and young adults::: more often in males than females::: more often following dose 2 than dose 1::: and typically within 4 days after vaccination. The state of Connecticut has announced that 18 cases of myocarditis in teenagers have been reported to the state department of health in association with administration of the experimental gene therapy vaccines.

,2021-06-01 12:27:10,Green is just one color of the rainbow 🌈 proud to be a Spartan! 💚,MSU::: thank you for being inclusive! I was thrilled to see this! You rock!,THANK YOU MSU! Happy Pride month to all the amazing doctors::: engineers::: artists::: therapists::: vets::: business peoples::: etc etc etc that attend MSU and are going to make this world amazing! 💕🥰🔥 I support you all!!!!,Thank you MSU::: for taking a stand::: and showing that you support your LGBTQ+ students::: faculty::: fans::: and alumni. Love wins! Yet one more reason I will always bleed green. 🌈,Angela DeLauney,You know everyone needs to be represented leave it green,Too many of these comments are flat out disgusting..its a shame! And the audacity to be so openly against showing support for the LGBTQ community is mind blowing,I wish THIS for everyone that reads my little post here. Showing love and acknowledgement to all humans for the beauty of their differences in beliefs::: heritage::: history::: and personal preferences::: is a beautiful gesture. If you don't understand that::: please chose to spend the time you're blessed with having on earth with people that aren't like you by your perception. You'll learn that they are also your brother or sister. My wife and I love you all regardless! We are blessed to share this life with each other::: and everyone we're fortunate enough to meet! ❤,To those objecting to this post::: remember there is a gay::: bi or trans teenager (or MSU student)in your family::: street or community who is contemplating suicide because of your kind of attitude. It’s not politics. It’s humanity showing support for the edges of society who are bullied and shunned by a non-caring::: self-righteous segment. It’s not enough to be accepting::: one has to publicly show their support.,Memo to those who are struggling with the concept here: Pride month isn’t about being proud to be LGBT. It’s about having the pride to not hide who you are::: even in the face of overwhelming ignorance like what we’re seeing here.,Thank you::: MSU for standing up for all. This logo does not exclude anyone except those who believe they have more rights than others. As a heterosexual cis ally I LOVE to see that MSU is recognizing pride month and supporting those around us who have not always felt supported 🌈 ❤️.,Maybe MSU should also support diversity and inclusion by resolving the Title IX lawsuits by its female athletes.,Very pretty but our colors are green and white. Most Spartans are kind to others but we can’t be put into one group regarding anything. Respect !,Well right now I'm ashamed that I even graduated from there schools need to stay out of politics they need to just do what they're paid to do teach the kids the logos were green and white they need to stay that way 365 days a year I will never pay a dime to them again:::,What about my German heritage or Italian::: English::: Slovakia heritage. People please grow up and look at individuals!!,"These comments are delicious! So many ""strong"" and ""fearless"" conservatives reduced to tears over showing support for people that suffer discrimination daily. They might need a safe space. 😆","No hatred. Some things just should not be changed in favor of ""politically correct""ness. Go Green (not go rainbow). MSU::: you have been in enough trouble lately::: don't start new battles::: please!",Happy Pride Month to all the students and faculty. Thank you for representing. ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜,It's really sad how many people are offended that the Spartan helmet logo has been changed for ONE post to show support and love for LGBTQ+ people.,Hideous🙄. Showing support is one thing::: no need to alter a traditional logo::: it's getting too carried away...,Yall need to chill they’re showing their support for the month of June::: it will be back green & white 🙄,STOP PANDERING TO THE 1 OR 2 % OF THIS COUNTRY !,The amount of people that are closet homophobes and cannot stand their school logo being temporarily altered...,Thank you MSU. To all you haters.... sorry people being loved and respected is so scary to you...,Let’s keep the politics out of the traditional colors of the Green and White☹️,Seeing so much hate over a simple color change on a logo definitely shows me I made the right choice to get out of Michigan after I finished my PhD. There’s a terrible cancer affecting that state. With two of the best universities in the world available to provide top notch education that’s a sad commentary.,"Again::: my alma mater embarrasses me with its non-stop virtue signaling. Stay out of politics. The recent email I got inviting me to watch and then discuss movies ""relevant to the social justice movement"" almost made me gag. Yesterday was Memorial Day. How about discussing a movie about storming the beach at Normandy by brave 18 year olds who died::: so that today's 18 year olds have the freedom to run around campus::: looking for a safe space::: in the event something in their life bums them out?",LOVE IS LOVE! WAY TO GO MSU!! ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🖤🤎🤍,I bet no one complained about this one::: right?,Some of these comments are crazy we just spent a day reflecting on people who sacrificed their lives so some people can be able to post what they post,If green isnt good enough just make it yellow (maize),Maybe MSU should teach that a human being doesn’t need labels....that we should just be kind to everyone...peri od!,Leave it green and white. No need to change it::: even for a month. This promotion of queerness is abhorrent!,What is MSU actually doing to better the lives of queer individuals?,Please no....some things need to remain constant! 💚💚💚,It's nice to have my University aware of GOD's promise not to flood the world again by showing the rainbow. At the same time Green and White represents ALL Spartans. If that's not good enough for all Spartans::: that's a shame.,All you snowflakes offended by a logo with colors on it ☺️,Our green and white is all inclusive. No need to separate one another. We will always be THE GREEN AND WHITE.,Come on Na Michigan state smh why do they Alphabet people feel like everyone have to know their sexual preferences? No one cares who you people sleep with stop forcing it on everyone else,I bet everyone here that is bothered by this will be more than ok when the colors are temporarily changed to red::: white::: and blue for the 4th 😂 literally everything will offend someone nowadays. Plus if you’re too naive to realize that MSU doesn’t need reform and awareness then you are the problem. Having just graduated and been apart of an organization that is often slandered by the university’s OWN STUDENTS by being called gay or f****ts while we rehearsed shows that people in the LGBTQ+ community do need support at MSU. Do better::: Spartans.,After this and the new COVID and vaccine rules at MSU. All I have to say is GO BLUE.,Go Green—solid green,I prefer the GREEN and WHITE!!,Love it::: but let’s get a more “Spartan” green in that rainbow.,Thank you msu for being so supportive.,Don’t ask questions!!!!!!,Here come all the offended people that aren't effected by this,Please go back to GREEN WHITE something you can't change..,If you are not going to change it to honor everyone? Don't change it at all.,Yes please go back to green and white. Your not proving anything by making it rainbow::: other than your weak and weird. NO ONE gets extra special treatment::: quit forcing stuff,Well::: you do know that those Spartans were all guys running around in tunics.,Sad stuff when a state university needs to promote lifestyles.,Way to go MSU!!! Love my Spartans.,All I see is different colors - no more no less no agenda ::: just a logo !,I think many of you are using the green and white colors as a mask for your prejudice. It was the same thing with anti-masking. This is lame.,I agree but the 👍 out weigh the negative.. that’s a move in the right direction. BTW.. i was a fortunate recipient of a athletic scholarship the first Year title IX took effect. it was very apparent the number of scholarship weighted toward high profile women sports. I know the funding has increased since her but there’s a long way to go til it’s equal,I see it the other way. It includes everyone. Besides::: why do you even care?,Love it! This representation makes me a proud msu student and ally to the lgbtq+ community. Because everyone should love and be who they need to. #loveislove🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍🌈🖤🤎🌈,If only Leonidas lived to see... I don't know if he would burst into tears or take his spear and begin the 2nd Thermopylae battle...,The other issue I have is to have UM colors on our logo. Will UM repay that and put Green and White in their logo. I think not.,Not all that inclusive in 70’s.. Does anyone else remember the Issues that came up when the student body President came out!!,As a two degree alumnus of MSU::: this saddens me. There are so many other ways to express your support than doing this.,If you do this for one group::: you must do it for all. Really::: stay Green and White. We can all be Spartans without dividing groups and giving them special recognition (which::: in the end::: usually proves to be more divisive than inclusive).,I thought the only colors were green and white,Green and White::: don't mess with the logo.,When do we get to see the new helmet logo? This might have been a good time to feature it with the rainbow colors. Easier for kids to accept if there’s a popular cause associated to it.,It makes me so sad seeing the nasty comments from former “Spartans.”,Snowflakes offended by the rainbow heheheh June is gone be a tough month for y’all bigots 😭🤣,It’s funny to see how many people that Pride doesn’t effect at all... CRY ABOUT THIS,And I'm just sick with the way God's rainbow has been abused.,Will Michigan answer and change there logo to green and white for the month? 🤣,Should only be Green and White !,Can’t wait to see their football uniforms!,We love everyone::: unless you believe in the Bible. You're entitled to your own opinion::: unless your opinion is you do not want to take a vaccine.,Why didn’t MSU change their LOGO to the American flag for Memorial Day? What is it with these institutions to pick and choose what fit a certain political narrative? I have no issue with show support to all groups. Just do the same thing for each group,I don’t know what the hell this is all about....you see::: I’m blind and color blind at the same time,This is most likely a hack by one of the students or staff.,This is inclusive of everyone it represents everyone hence all the colors::: some of the comments I’ve read on here are pure ignorance and you shouldn’t even be allowed to call yourself a Spartan being so ignorant.  This doesn’t just represent one group::: it represents everyone coming together and if you have a problem with it FIND A NEW COLLEGE.,What about being inclusive with people who don't want the vaccine? Guess you make up your own rules.,What a magnificent honeypot.,Where r the green and white colors?,🤔 what happened to Spartan green? They're singling out 1 group to identify with now? How bizarre,Stop. Whats next the US flag. I het it but i don't need it shoved down my throat.

Stop trying to rewrite history and change your mascot if you're so LGBT friendly. Respect the fearless soldiers the Spartans were.,These comments are disgusting so many of you so called humans can’t even leave the rude comments to yourself it’s for pride month and nobody even cares what you have to say. June is pride month. Love is love. Your comments are going to be ignored. Now stfu and get over yourselves. Love is love GO MSU❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🖤🤍🤎 humans are supposed to respect and support each other not tear each other down. If you’re going to be mad about this logo then you’re not a human. You’re an animal.,Rather than having the school change it’s traditional recognized for generations colors. Let’s have the “other” groups create their own school identity.

Go Green!,When I was at MSU there was a large tree growing in a big concrete bowl. I believe it was near the aud but I can't remember for sure. Does anyone else remember this tree::: have a photo of it::: or know where it would be on that tree map? I'm not sure if it's still there. This was in the '00s,The VERY best part of what makes MSU's campus so special..,Dr Telewski! Miss you and the gang Frank Ewers. Go green! My favorites of the MSU trees were always the magnolias by the chapel. I've wanted one in my yard ever since::: but wasn't sure of the variety for the hardiness. Looks like the chapel ones are magnolia soulangeana... Do they thrive naturally or do they get special treatment to survive there? Thx,This is such a wonderful campus. I spent a lot of time there learning plant species. I am using the knowledge that I acquired today n my own Wetland Restoration business. Sparty forever💙,Interesting... MSU is a beautiful campus. The old trees::: and the beauty of West Circle was one of the reasons I choose MSU. And::: I was lucky enough to live in Yakeley for four years. Beal Garden was so close. I enjoyed it often.,"One of my favorite gardens the state tree garden.... a tree from each stare (not necessarily the State Tree). The California Redwood was growing and getting bigger and even though planted by Dr. Beal himself in the mid 50's is still considered a ""baby"" by redwood standards.",Spent some time with a botany volunteer in one of the gardens ( the garden by the library::: I think that is the Beal garden) who gave such wonderful information on my favorite redwood trees that came from China.,Dendrology was one of my favorite classes due in large part to the beautiful trees on campus.,Saints Rest at it’s peak autumn glory is the most beautiful place in Michigan for a few days.,Love it. I wonder if we could get someone to give us a presentation next year I love trees,The campus is beautiful! And the fact that every tree is respected was something I did not realize the meaning of until later::: when another university I was associated with cut down several Red Oaks and disposed of them. Also::: I may have broken an MSU ordinance once or twice...,MSU has a beautiful campus::: which is one of the reasons I chose to go there.,My favorite places are the glen across from the main library near the bell tower and the stand of fir trees behind Munn Arena.,It is a beautiful campus::: will never forget my years there.,In the old day the yardages on the golf course were for the Chinese Elm or Douglas Fir or a particular type of Yew.,Where I learned my plant identification skills!

Don’t pat yourself on the back until you get the job done.,I had someone coming in my first floor dorm room::: my bed was by the door. I screamed and ran out into the hall. All MSU did was put outside bars on our windows. This happened around 1970.,Does it include acting on information you have when you are made aware of your doctor’s raping students 20yrs prior to it becoming public?,Gee...just say you will enforce law.

Deter!,Weird photo someone chose for this announcement.,This is great stories::: continue being safe::: continue being blessed.,Gogreen andgowhite,Nancy Hogshead-Makar FYI,How about a strategic plan to stop racialism?

Long before the brain trust of MSU came along::: farmers and ranchers have been working to improve livestock and soil to make more money for their families.,Who writes this?

President Stanley shares a statement acknowledging the impact on our community of the trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin. http://go.msu.edu/Dtp,2021-04-20 22:34:05,Very hard to have ANY hard conversations when they keep changing what words mean. Beyond these created barriers we need to CARE about America more than Dems or Reps. WE ARE AMERICANS!,Dr. Stanley::: please back up this statement: “Since the trial began::: dozens of people have been killed by police.”  You can’t::: it’s a flat out lie. Actually::: closer to the opposite is true. More police officers have been killed—their murders have increased exponentially in the last year::: because of dangerous rhetoric like this. And you conveniently leave out important details about facts surrounding the two other cases.  You’re being political and you have a campus police department you should be considering and showing support for as well.,We may have made a poor choice for next MSU president.,Floyd was a known felon and high of drugs at the time of his arrest for passing counterfeit money. The arrest was justified and not based on race. Not only did he resist arrest but he was also a big dude that was hard for all the officers to deal with. The neck hold was a MPD trained technique. This isn’t a race issue. Stop making it one,Great until the campus thought nazis shut down conservative speakers,If you wanted a conversation why do you keep canceling and censoring people you disagree with?,as a 60 year old white male::: I do not feel supported by MSU or any liberal entity. It is obvious my age group is not valued or appreciated. As a parent to two MSU grads it is very disappointing.,These conversations seem to promote more division than identifying constructive answers::: creating unity or describing solutions that preserve society.  A person was improperly held. His color more often would have been White statistically. I understand many prefer to look at this on a percentage basis. Statistically the person would be a criminal.  We seem to be trying very hard to look at something simply wrong through a very specific lens. Unfortunately that lens will more likely give us a flawed solution::: if any.,How about letting the students engage in ANY face to face conversations on your campus? Forcing them into solitary confinement in the dorms with less socialization than most prisoners is not a good look Stanley. But hey::: you’ve got better priorities I guess.,Why did he have to make any comment at all?,Focus on providing a quality education and not chiming in on politics. THe best way to unite all of us is by not focusing on what divides us.,Shut up.  The pandering has no limits. I’m embarrassed by all the ‘wokeness’ from this lame institution.,Would expect something more profound from a major university President -\-\ what does Stanley's statement even mean? 🤡,Hopefully the MSU police department has changed since I chaired the Tailgate Committee and the Women's Safety Task Force in the early 2000's.,Most universities are bastions of liberal socialist ideology. I don’t care what they say or think!,Here I thought Samuel Stanley should focus on making MSU better.  How was that Mark D’Antonio deposition? You should probably break the news about football and raping women before the news does..  🤫🤷‍♂️🤫🤫😬😬😬,Educate not indoctrinate... . Go back to Long Island and spew your beliefs.,This from the President who supposedly understands infectious diseases but keeps ignoring the Covid surge just to have the public be in spartan stadium for football.,University need to get back to teaching how to think not what to think. The progressive philosophy of the teaching staff should be left to conversations at the student union or forum not the class room.,Steve Culp,You don’t build consensus when focusing on division.,How about a little virtue signaling?,I would like to see my university staying out of politics and concentrate on education.,What an absolutely useless statement.,Will you promise that these difficult discussions are two-sided::: and not woke lectures?,Spartans will,Top fan Awan Dada,Oh shut up and quit stirring the pot.,💚⚖️💪🏽,💚💚,💚🤍,Stanley’s a woke joke.,Agree,Back at ya!!,How is an educator spouting this illogical divisive rhetoric “... The verdict marked the culmination of nearly one year of calls for justice following our anger over the death of George Floyd and the killings of Black Americans by police”?  This is almost as unhinged as LeBum James claiming that Black Americans were “being hunted” by police. Literally 1 degree less unhinged.  Sadly::: Black Americans are being slaughtered by Black Americans - predominantly gang members - at horrifying rates. Murder is up another 56% this year in our inner cities. AND NO ONE CARES. Because it doesn’t fit their agenda.,THIS...IS...SPA RTA!!!,Because Mob Rule is what our society should strive for. Believe your eyes::: believe the media lies.,🤫 go blue,Stay in your lane,When are you going to be issuing a statement in support of finding Jaslyn Adams’ killer? Of the utter failure of race-based charging employed by too many of our urban county prosecutors::: resulting in gang members quickly returning to the streets again?  And of the horrifying way this 7 year old American child was repeatedly shot and slaughtered by rabid gang members over the weekend?  Say. Her. Name.,Why have I lost my Top Fan status?,Say no to drugs,Translation: prays there is no repeat of the 1972 riot
Spartans help make Michigan a better place.,2021-04-19 13:08:36,"It would be interesting to see the statistic on how many return to Michigan. I graduated and lived elsewhere for 15 years before ""coming home"" and couldn't be happier!",I stayed for 34 years so far. Sold millions for companies here in Michigan::: hired many employees::: provided services for many companies::: lived in 3 different apartments and purchased two homes. Raised my daughter here. Started my own business and helped more than 40 divers continue their quest to College. Coached 100’s of others too. All because of some great coaches and the opportunity given to me by becoming an MSU Spartan Diver!! I’m was a kid from the State of New York! I stayed! MSU::: please continue to give swimmers and divers the opportunity to come To MSU become a Spartan and help make the State of Michigan prosper!,This post really needs to come down. Not only is the graphic strange and could be interpreted as though the UP isn't contributing to Michigan's economy::: but also many of these folks who leave the state do still donate to MSU and therfore continue to support the state in many ways... unless MSU is saying our out-of-state donations aren't appreciated. MSU Alumni Office,If this were true::: than your tuition would be extremely lower..,I'm surprised this made it through the gate keepers. There's something very unfortunate and misleading in this post.,We went to work for a former MSU instructor::: but in a different state.....but still had the green connection!,"Go forth and raise the consciousness of the state::: please. It desperately needs your help in elevating economic::: civics::: national whole-democracy -lifting::: public-discours e-and demeanor::: and community-purpo se policy and practices at home. Please::: teach these things actively there.  This is the perfect opportunity for Michigan State University -\-\ as a place so much ""of::: by and for the people"" -\-\ to show how we will ""Go right through..."" for our democracy be it there or all the way out here to Norcal::: and often around the world. We're everywhere!",uh ... what about those grads who choose to stay in Upper Michigan::: not the the little bit by Escanaba?,I decided to be Michigan's gift to Conneticut where i practice midwestern courtesy::: polite and considerate driving::: and provide hours of random conversation with strangers regarding the weather.,I left::: but::: always tried to do my best for Michigan from out of state.,I left Michigan because the winters were just too harsh for me. I loved my time at MSU but I won't go back.,I guess this is saying the UP is great without MSU. I mean everyone knows that but it’s good to see big bad MSU admit it. Lol,As a State Grad (78) who lives outside of MI the graphic was pretty clear::: it's not literal::: they are not ignoring the UP.,Over half the people I went to State with left Michigan .....,What is the map supposed to represent?,Michigan was great while I was there::: but now I understand it's become a socialist wasteland run by the radical leftwing criminals.,Why? I had to leave in '93. Doesn't appear any better today.,Why did they not color the rest of the UP?,How many find a job worth what they paid for college:::i bet more than half are sorry they went:::you make them take so many classes that have nothing to do with their career choice:::so quit bragging on yourself:::trade school students probably do better in the long run,I’m a bit offended by this. I left Michigan - after graduating in 1976. Was there some kind of secret contract that said I had to stay and “contribute” to Michigan?!? MSU degrees only “contribute” in Michigan? Am I supposed to feel guilty for leaving? I paid for my education. Contract fulfilled. Period.,Odd that although the original post started about MSU::: many of the comments seem to reflect the political views that I'd expect from University of Michigan alumni. 🤔😂,Our 2007 grad left for a finance job in another state as did many of his classmates. That was another time.....no jobs in most majors in Michigan then.,Live in North Carolina but I still....,The other half moved to another state because the Michigan economy was in the horrible when they graduated,First 5 years in Michigan and thenSC then NC then MD then retired in TX,"Man::: we need to add ""reading visual graphics"" to the ISS curriculum.",I left in 89::: but still love Michigan and MSU💕,The other half are in Chicago! LOL #classof91,Best state in the country! I would never leave!,I'd be there if i could! But grad school took me away.,Hate to say this but bad choice of subject for an advertisement. Particularly with Whitmore in office and the state of the state. .THINK ABOUT IT !,I had to leave the state to find a decent job in 1984. Getting out of Michigan was the best thing that happened to me. Unfortunately I got a job offer I could not refuse 12 years later and ended up in Michigan.,Wow::: the people who are triggered here because the graphic uses the state as a thermometer::: and the level of green is the percentage of MSU grads who stay in the state... it's got NOTHING TO DO WITH DISSING THE U.P.,Actually there are better jobs outside of Michigan and that's why we had to leave and move to Texas. 🤷‍♀️,As long as the UAW controls michigan autos the smartest minds will go to Austin Texas or work remote.,I left the state::: but I really enjoyed coming back to Lansing to work for two years. I finally got the Michigan summers I'd always dreamed of.,And the other half moves to Chicago lmao,Was this map omitting the UP approved by Izzo?,Moved to Florida in 1970,I wanted to stay::: but the opportunity that I gained better experience was not in MI,I left Michigan. Best decision ever.,Alums from Isle Royale stay seated on 3rd down and scream “down in front!”,What is the median income for a MSU graduate?

Top 5 nationally for highest tax rates::: worse roads::: one of worst unemployment situations in the nation::: 3 cities in top 10 most violent in US and to top it off the Governors covid plans have been a trainwreck.,I'm in the group that didn't... went to Grad School at University of Utah Physics & Astronomy and fell in love with the west.,Yes::: I personally know four!,What a nasty post for us in the UP.,On the other hand::: more than half choose to leave Michigan.,I just don't wanna be far from my momma...oh yeah and contributing ;),you youngin's fight nice::: now::: you hear ??,Not me I'm living at the beach 🏖️ myrtle beach sc 😎,The other half live where it’s WARM for crying out loud...,Not surprising as this isn't just true for Michigan::: where the vast majority of those born and raised in a state::: never really leave it.,Then retire in Florida hahaha. We like our peninsulas::: but we like them with warm water in the winter.,That’s because they can’t afford to move out of state!!,80% 0f MSU students are from Michigan vs 60% at the UM.,Whitmer is a witch::: who wants to live under her law,Brian Lowen how could you betray Michigan like that,I love MSU,Spartan Proud 💚,💚🤍💚🤍💚,The other almost half leave...Like me....Ha,Adem Ćosović,Awesome 👍😎,THIS STATE IS A PRISON,Julia Rios 🥴,Patrick McNallen Ryan Henry lol,Jules Peezy..,💚,Weird graphic,John N Vivian Stevens have a laugh at the offended people,Melinda Phillips,🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣,#SpartansWill,Spartans Will.

Chem labs looked a bit different in the 1890s.,2021-04-08 18:34:01,Not wearing goggles other than that pretty similar to my undergrad chem labs in the 90”s.,Thank God for the improvements today as my Austin’s degree was in Chemistry and I bet there was a lot of mistakes and scary experiments.,Broke more than my fair share of Claisen adapters.,Why are the men wearing printed lab coats in the second picture?,What do think Elizabeth Benyi :::Alan Proszek ? Are kids think we are this old but I don't remember chem lab like this. Lol,Yea::: there aren't any #women or #BIPOC,Was Andrew Kehoe there then?,All the mouth pipetting 😝,I’m more in awh about the dresses,At least we had the quonset hut labs.,What hall is this?,Wonder what OSHA would say? Lol,Sarah Lienard,Because students are actually learning?,Jake Evasic,Don't you have to be dundant before you can be redundant?,No women. ~sigh~,😱🧑🏻‍🔬🧪,Savanah Klegon Joyce Shultz Klegon,Andy Rabins::: Sophie Rabins,no women!,Is this from Wuhan China?,The company am working for is helping people due to this pandemic:::dm and let me put you through
Beginning Friday::: MSU will start administering doses of a COVID-19 vaccine to its registered students. http://go.msu.edu/D6p,2021-04-07 22:34:18,I hope EVERY student will take advantage and get the vaccine. Rutgers is going to require vaccination for attendance next fall. As a former Public Health Nurse (MSU GRAD) I think that is a good idea.,For all of you who are against getting the covid vaccine::: Just think of the long term effects of getting covid. It doesn't always go away! The only way to stop this monster is to fight back.,This is awesome. Thanks for providing that opportunity to the students. Any plans in the works for providing that same accesses to staff::: employees::: instructors::: etc...?,why are so many angry? I went through small pox vaccines and boosters.....no small pox in the world. and my whole family went together to get the Salk polio vaccine. Just something to think about.,This is a great option for the students. Thanks for providing this opportunity. They are all adults and can decide for themselves if they want to exercise their right to get the vaccine if they want to. Thanks MSU for providing them with this option - it shows you care about the students.,It's so funny to me that everyone commenting here is so opinionated. I'd have to pull up the email msu sent out to student a week or so ago::: but they took a survey and some 80% of students already planned to get the vaccine voulantarily when it was offered to them - that speaks for itself. This isn't something that's being forced and it's not something MSU even has to push because the students want it.,Those not getting it are not going to get to go enjoy many things. Cruise ships not letting people on without a vaccine::: music venues arent either a lot of things going to require vaccine proof before you are allowed to put others at risk. Imagine how full of crap a parent that forces a kid to get vaccinated to go to school so they can do what they want to go do in life telling them it's safe and they wont take one themselves.,If penn state can mandate students having the meningitis vaccine before setting foot on campus then they can and should do the same for COVID-19. Just saying.,Glad I am done with college. Will this vaccine make you a great student? I think you will be getting them yearly now folks. GMO students. Pink Floyd. Hey teachers leave our kids alone. Hey science leave our kids alone.,When I was a student::: back in the dark ages::: we received polio vaccinations at registration.,Thank you for being a leader in the fight against C-19!,I got my emergency swine flu vaccine there in 1976(?).,Got to love all the Pro Choice people exposing themselves as not really pro choice.,Great! So student should be face to face in the fall!,DO NOT MAKE THIS MANDATORY.,Any young female shouldn’t take the vaccine cuz the long term effects on fertility were never studied::: mainly on placenta changes that usually are affected by vaccines.,MLive::: Since you are the Gretches spoken person::: are the students going to be given the choice as to whether they get a shot?,To me the amazing thing to read is how many people think this is a mandatory thing. It. Is. Not. If you think it is::: please read the article.,University of Cincinnati just started vaccinating students this week!,Okay as long as it is not mandatory.,Great but way behind the curve on this one. Glad its finally available.,Awesome. Go MSU!,i got my first shot::: came back neg.,BUT THEY DO NOT NEED IT People are sheep. They’re just going to follow.... God help us all,Why not start with UM and see what happens first? 😬,Why would teens get this? There have been no tests on pregnant women of any substance.,Maybe you should have done that before all came down here to Florida on Spring Break.,where do we sign up?,Don’t be a science experiment-say No,Yes!! Go Green. My son is there. Thank you,So proud to work at MSU.,They are advising to freeze your eggs and or sperm. Which tells me it is not safe.,Gather authentic research students to save your lifes,It should be the students weither or not to get the vaccine,The craziest at it’s best,Ok so how do we sign up?,Don’t let that happen pupils.,Only 3 months LATE ??,Not if it were my kid.,Daughter is signed up and ready!,Until I know long term effects I will nicely decline. Just because other vaccines have not had long term effects (that we know of) does not mean this will not. Look at the medication thalidomide. 9 months is not enough of a long term for me to feel safe taking the medication. This is a personal choice. I do not criticize those who choose the vaccine so those of us who decline should also have our choice respected.,264 fully vaccinated people in the state of Michigan came down with Covid. The vaccine isn't all it's cracked up to be.,Facebook won't let me tell you what I think about the covid-19 vaccine,How does he know it is safe. There is no long term testing completed and it has been out for around 4 months??????? Such BS narrative. for the record::: I am not anti vax::: I am against forcing injections of something we do not have enough data to understand its long term effect,As long as they are given a choice to get it and not forced::: by negative discriminatory consequences. There is no long term data and Johnson and Johnson is not a very trustworthy company.,Because the vaccine is under FDA Emergency Use Authorization it can NOT be made mandatory for health care providers or others. People need to read the law. Hopefully this gets challenged soon.,none of the vaccines have been fda approved. no one knows long term effects of vaccine owners of vaccine patien want to depopulate the planet my guess is the vaccine will cause cancer in 5 to 10 years or staralize many that get it or cause birth defect in up coming generations,Why should students who don't get the shot be exposed to those who got the gene altering shot (not a vaccine) that causes them to produce COVID inside themselves till the day they die. And they might be forever unable to carry a baby or even get pregnant. But if they do::: now that their genes are altered::: all their descendants will forever carry the altered genes If you chose to not have your body forever altered::: why should you not be allowed to be next to someone who had the gene shot? It doesn't really keep you from getting Covid::: and if you don't get the shot::: you have a 99% chance of surviving Covid. Duh!!!,It’s not a vaccine! It’s an experimental biological agent! C19 has a 99.7% recovery rate!,I'm 99.97% sure I dont need that vaccine,People should be given a choice. Just because the school is offering it they cannot mandate an experimental vaccine or they can be sued.,A month later than Texas,Meanwhile hundreds of supposedly vaccinated people are turning up positive for COVID-19 in Michigan.,EUA is optional,Excellent idea. Vaccinate before students go home.

The rise in anti-APIDA and anti-Asian violence in this country is abhorrent. We stand with our APIDA and Asian students::: faculty::: staff and alumni to oppose this hate::: discrimination and intolerance. http://go.msu.edu/smp,2021-03-18 13:36:40,How about “Mental Health Awareness” will take priority at MSU. That’s the real issue here. That man in Atlanta is mentally ill. It is a global crisis. Hate is what is being spread through lies in the media and our Government...in cluding those in authority at MSU.,⚘⚘HATE HAS NO PLACE ANYWHERE....PER IOD⚘⚘To force an ideology upon others without an open forum for discussion and debate is contrary to the ABSOLUTE MEANING OF EDUCATION. Hate creates intolerance and strong arm tactics that lead to oppression::: discord::: and violence!,Just remember that hating conservatives and Christians and people with an opinion different than the current progressive agenda is also not tolerated. College used to be a place to compare ideas. Now no one wants to listen to an opinion that's different from what's popular. Hate all things discriminatory.,"Except President Stanley's hate::: you mean?  President Stanley's email and statement are - not ironically - aimed at creating the very hatred and division he pretends to lament. It's despicable::: and the Marxist needs to resign immediately. It's hard to be more ashamed of my alma mater (nice preferred pronouns::: BTW)::: but he's overachieving::: sadly.  Here's what we do know: The suspected serial killer specifically told police that his actions were NOT racially motivated::: but that ""he wanted to eliminate locations he saw as ‘temptations’ for his sex addiction"".  But ""science"" matters? ""Facts"" matter? Instead::: the manifesto to divide and pit everyone against one other is all that matters::: in the aim of furthering the Party. Dr. Stanley may want to brush up on what the communists generally do to artists and scholars once in power - it's horrific and also what they do without fail.",The fact that MSU has to even mention this is messed up. We should be tolerant of everyone::: left or right. We can be against a cause but we need to be respectful. This is our current society-pretty messed up!,We’d like to think so . Listen to minority student groups ! Something the Board of Trustees has failed to do . 💚,Yet you didn’t stand behind gymnasts? You let them get molested for years. You don’t stand behind freedom of speech on campus. You are virtue signaling::: nothing else. Nobody supports violence against anyone. This is just another attempt to divide people and create the appearance of something that is not. The shooting in ATL had nothing to do with race. The police have said that. There is evidence to support that::: yet the media and politicians continue the narrative that somehow people are shooting Asian Americans because of Covid. Nonsense!,And I'm glad an institution of knowledge and learning is willing to come out and make its position known 💚,When I talk about the virus that has ravaged our world and took my father's life too early::: I am certain to point out it is the Chinese GOVERNMENT that I hold accountable for so much death and destruction!,How about standing for your white conservative students for a nice change???,MSU is getting as bad as CBS using their popular shows like Blue Bloods to push this insane agenda. Stop trying to divide us::: as these statements are discriminatory!,And that means Christian and Conservative ALSO::: MSU!!!!!,They just need to close all college's::: why::: because they are letting all these illegals in::: they don't have a degree and will get our jobs. Why spend all that money just to have them teach hate and bad things.,I hope this isn't referring to what in Atlanta. It had nothing to do with race.,I didn’t know it had a place at another university???,Focus on standing for all your students instead of playing the woke game.,The fact that this simple message has stirred up such controversial discussion; is a reflection of what is truly wrong with the world.,Oh Stop being a lemming. Also stop trying to scare Asian Students away from studying in the US by parroting talking points,Yeah::: well::: you tolerated it when I was in school because I'm a white::: Christian conservative. Thanks for nothing!,So President Stanley has joined the hate crusade.,So does that mean you are merging with University of Michigan????,This should literally go unsaid. Another place trying to pander.,Having virtually a lifelong association and proximity to MSU I can offer my observations. Both as a student and a frequent visitor::: I never witnessed any Asian hate. I witnessed a bit when a Christian proselytizer called for conversation::: openly::: near Beaumont Tower. This click-bait post is just plain virtue signalling. It might be interesting to trace the source to find out who at MSU thinks they need to send this message. Ironically::: this post tends to elute the opposite effect. Sincerely::: a once proud MSU alumnus...SMH,Get real people::: according to all the data on Asian violence::: it is and has not increased ... check the FACTS!,Stop properganda! Stop using opportunities to push an agenda! Jumping on this bandwagon based on this incident is concerning to me. Especially with your history of response/cover up to sexual assault! Caring about hate and victims across the board is more integrous than selectively pushed narratives.,Hate has no place anywhere::: except the government.,It’s also wrong to discriminate against conservative speakers at commencement ceremonies. Also we need more tolerance and acceptance of Christians.,I am a Spartan::: and I hate evil and evildoers. I hope that’s still okay.,MSU and it should be everywhere.🙏🏼,What about Racism and social segregation?,MSU::: do you overtly discriminate against Asian-Americans in your admissions policies like Harvard?,In My Opinion Hate has no place anywhere.  As a gay Man i see myself confronted with hate day to day.  With that being said i would love to find some new friends to hangout with or just chat..,Neither has Critical Race Theory but yet there it is....,Hate has no business anywhere! GO GREEN,Steve Culp the fact that MSU felt the need to even publish this is ridiculous. Are the people at top putting this out for another reason?,Hate has no place..End of Story!!! Very well said::: M.S.U.💚,Thank you for making a statement on it. Helps us to be proud Spartans.,Then I guess I'll boycott your games MSU because it's posts like this that makes me hate. 😡,Until Ben Shapiro shows up to drop some truth bombs on you,Constant virtual signaling::: nothing but race. Fed up!,What Asian hate... what are you talking about? This is getting absolutely ridiculous now.,Does that mean you'll stop disadvantaging them in enrollment applications?,1 agree no hate anywhere 2 quit saying the mass shooting was because the people were of Asian heritage it was because the guy “visited” “massage spas” aka happy ending spas and wanted to end “his” temptation (basically a nut case) and the women that worked there were of Asian heritage period..... I wish MSU would deal with the facts this has nothing to do with their race but where they worked unfortunately.. ... he was insane period,Hate has no place on Earth.,Does not now and never did.🌟,Everyone knows that. So::: who are you yelling at?,except when we play Michigan at home.,Is it because you cave in,"There is no ""rise in anti-Asian violence.""",Michigan State has become a leftist indoctrination camp and diploma mill. Because of this::: after earning two degrees at MSU::: I have cancelled my planned donations to this university.,We need more people like Corey. https:// twitter.com/ coreyrforrester/ status/ 1372208985063964 674?s=21,Niether does liberal ideology::: yet here you are.,Well you must of hated lossing to UCLA last night,Simplify it. You have rights and the other has rights. You have no right to mess with others rights.  Emotions and passions are NOT rights. Freedom is the ultimate right. If you are forcing an opinion::: you are violating others freedom.,Hate unfortunately will always find a victim.,I am proud of MSU!,*Except hate for the Wolverines.,Uh oh karen alert....upset they can't tell racists jokes anymore,There is no statistical increase in hate crimes against Asians. This guy clearly had a mental illness that has been backed up by others who knew him. I'm sorry anybody was killed but he didn't target Asians. The vast majority of people here who immigrated from China are here to escape that terrible regime and we welcome and love them.,Yet this university let Nasser go on for years. SMH,....or anywhere else.,President Stanley is the worst president that MSU has ever had. This is not the first time he has come out with one of his inane PC statements. Remember when he issued a decree welcoming illegal aliens to MSU? He is nothing but a radical Leftist hack and he is turning MSU into a typical liberal indoctrination university. It’s time for all donors (especially the major donors) to demand his resignation and halt any further donations until then!And enough with the absurd “preferred pronouns”! You are a male::: of course you are a “HE or HIM”!!!,Everyone already knows and agrees with this. This is more virtue signaling and pushing a narrative than it is about anti -hate. The Atlanta tragedy is not proven or likely to be a hate crime or anti-Asian hate. To act like it is simply based on the identity of the victims and perp does a disservice to justice.,The University protects those that knew about Nassar's crimes. Big payouts and extended vacations. Who paid the settlement? Tuition increases?,I see a lot of BS in this post and comments. Get back to teaching and making students think rather than forceplaced indoctrination.,Nice virtue signalling Michigan state. You sure didn't hate Nassar. You covered it up for years,Hate of any type rather it be race::: sexual orientation::: gender::: political or any sort should not be tolerated,Based upon the reaction to the rainbow Spartan helmet::: I’d say hate has moved in and taken over.,"Even in the last 3 years::: I've heard a LOT of anti-trans::: anti-gay and anti-Muslim slurs. Many of them by management and full-time people.....thos e who have had a minimum of training and should know....and respect.

There was a proposal to remove potato chips from the school lunch menu. We received a letter telling us that potato chips were actually thinly sliced potatoes that had been fried. I giggled then and giggle now thinking about it. Of course it was an unsuccessful amendment.,Would have been nice to explain exactly what features they are looking for in a chip potato other than storage time which could also be influenced by advances in storage technique.

MSU is planning more than 50 limited-attendance outdoor graduation ceremonies to recognize the accomplishments of the spring 2021 graduating class.  MSUTODAY.MSU.EDU MSU to hold smaller::: in-person spring graduation ceremonies,2021-03-10 14:58:04,So disappointed in Michigan State University for announcing students graduating in summer cannot walk now. 6 weeks before the ceremony. Send back the cap and gown::: cancel our reservations because apparently our daughter will not be honored now. I would love to have President Stanley go visit my daughter right now who is so depressed after hearing she can’t walk that she can’t even function. Shame on you MSU! This alumni will not be returning for future games and you will for sure never see another dime from our family. What a disappointment. Go Blue (where our son is attending and we’ve been so much happier with their handling of the pandemic).,We just learned yesterday that my daughter can't walk because she has a class this summer. My daughter is DEVASTATED. She has waited 4 years for this and worked so hard. We are hurt. She has one summer class because of Covid and because MSU cancelled her study abroad late last spring. Everyone told her every step of the way she'd be able to walk this spring. She has her cap and gown and we were ready to go celebrate. How can you change this 6 week before the ceremony? Hurtful doesn't begin to describe what you are doing to these students and their families. With the ability to be in limited crowds expanding::: the time of year and the size of the campus there is no excuse on why graduation could not accommodate ALL the kids that are graduating. We're disgusted and plan on doing all we can to have the school reconsider. These students have suffered enough. Michigan State University - do your job. The students did theirs. The parents paid a lot of money for this day and this moment. No one will want to walk in December. That's hurtful and insulting. Taylor Mackenzie,Why aren’t Ph.D students being recognized through socially distanced::: outdoor ceremonies as well?  There is instructions on hooding by a family member or friend on your website.  Graduate degree recipients are people who not only worked hard for an advanced degree but mentored and taught the undergraduate students who will get to hear their name called out for acknowledgment of their hard work and degree.,Why are advanced degree ceremonies for master’s and doctoral degree recipients and education specialists not provided the same opportunity for in-person graduation to recognize our milestone accomplishment? We worked just as hard on our degrees (with the added pandemic stress) and deserve the same opportunity to celebrate our accomplishments ! If it’s possible for a majority of the other degrees::: then the opportunity should be available for all degrees.,5c of the order on March 2.  Gatherings at colleges and universities::: trade schools::: and career schools are permitted for the purpose of holding in-person classes and other events sponsored by the educational institution. The limits imposed by section 2(a) and 2(b) do not apply to such gatherings::: but they remain subject to all other applicable requirements of this order  MSU—-there are solutions.  Please email commencement@ms u.edu and let them know we want all our seniors to have a ceremony. They deserve it!,Once again MSU has failed many students! In years to come I won’t be surprised if donations drop because why would alumni want to give back to an institution that has taken so much away. So frustrating!,Thank you::: MSU::: for making this work. A right of passage that I’m so thankful we will be able to enjoy 💚,My son didn’t have a 2020 graduation which I understand but why will his Master’s be virtual if spring graduations are being held for everyone else??,Except you decided to cut out the hard working summer graduates who were told that they would be allowed to walk in the spring commencement. Mid semester you tell us we won't be allowed to walk but that we will be invited for fall commencement. Many of us will be living in different states working full time jobs or continuing our education https://t.co/ 5dRYH9DfHl,Time-honored tradition for some students::: but not those graduating with a masters or doctoral degrees. I don't understand!,The decision to not allow summer graduates to walk at spring commencement...☹️. Like these students have not had enough to deal with::: to find this out March 5th that they can’t be there April 30 and have to wait eight months is so::: so disappointing. Name in the program::: cap and gown bought::: but not allowed to attend 😭. How many of these summer grads does MSU think are actually going to want to walk in December? Or how many will be able? And it’s in a parking lot::: so it’s hard to understand why some extra space cannot be found. Families of spring grads get preference over the students themselves ☹️☹️. Perhaps if the guests were virtual the students could have seats.,Oh::: so you can do something for the thousands of undergrads::: but you can’t do anything for a graduating MBA class of 90 people. Nice job. 👏👏. You guys have done a poor job of handling this pandemic. You should look to other universities to see how it should be handled.,I am thankful that I can go see my baby graduate. I’m thankful her dad can go too. I just wish there was a way to get her sister in there too. My daughters have always been best friends and the closest sisters I’ve ever seen. It’s so sad that she won’t be able to go although we are fully vaccinated. The day will be beautiful but Ashley will definitely feel alicias absence.,Small ceremony::: huge accomplishment! Congrats Tracy Schluckbier and the rest of the class of ‘21! #SpartanForLife,Congratulations Alaina!!,So happy for you::: Rob and Andrew to celebrate together!!!!!,This is a real swing and miss by MSU. Why not allow departments to hold their own graduations::: allowing them to use our world-class outdoor athletic facilities instead of parking lots? What about in-person recognition of master's and doctoral students who do the research that keeps the lights on?,That’s awesome! How about recognizing the class of 2020?,I understand cancelling graduation for 2020::: but are there any plans to hold a ceremony to recognize these individuals in the future? I worked 5 years on my graduate degree and getting basically a webcast was a pretty unceremonious way to end half a decade of work.,Can someone please explain why graduate students can’t have an outdoor ceremony too? Most graduate programs are small so I’m not understanding the logic behind this.,What about our 2020 graduates?,What a joke. My son graduated last year and had NO ceremony. None. We have a cap and gown that I even paid for,F.A.I.L! To not have in person graduation ceremonies for masters and doctorate student? Shame on you MSU. You failed twice. A virtual graduation for undergrad in Spring 2020 and a virtual ceremony for a Masters degree in 2021. So so disappointed in MSU. #openMSU,Has MSU thought through what a bitter taste these choices are leaving people with at the end of their time at the school? Nobody should want this to be the parting note. Not if you understand PR. I completely understand the need for safety. This is about planning and not ability. These posts from unhappy people should be very concerning because they CAN be rectified. I believe it’s within the budget and ability of the school. MSU CAN do better. Spartans Will. I mean that sincerely.,Still waiting to hear word on when MSU will have an in person graduation ceremony for the Class of 2020.,When I graduated from MSU::: put a big white M (for Mary) on my cap so my parents would be able to find me!,Is there anyone who can tell me how you get tickets for these ceremonies. My daughter RSVP'd as she was instructed to by email but we have received no tickets as of yet. Thanks.,I didn’t get my undergrad graduation last spring::: now you have once again taken graduation from me for my Master’s degree this year. Why are you willing to accommodate everyone except the Master’s and PhD graduates??,In the various parking lots outside vs. inside. Hope for good weather.,Why aren’t you using the football stadium instead of a parking lot???? It has lots of space::: a jumbo tron::: seats::: and a sound system. Plenty of space to handle the advanced degrees,This is amazing. My UM senior it is incredibly disappointed with their lack of any creative efforts. #gogreen,Can't PEOPLE JUST BE HAPPY TO be ALIVE and have any degree they earned.STOP COMPLAINING and be thankful to breathe!!!,I can see enrollment for MSU to continue to decline because of the stupid decisions like this being made ALL the time.,So the 30k of tuition dollars i paid for my graduate degree gets me a virtual commencement. Coolcoolcool. Glad i worked so hard.,Go Green! Go White! Go Spartans!,Seriously can't believe that masters students only get virtual :(,Please tell me what the exact number is for limited attendance!,Olivia Statler,Hope all will be included!,Alaina Elliott that Cap and Gown is now gonna be worn for more than just pictures!! Congrats to you!💚,Shame on MSU for this decision,Linda Marable,Katie Treloar Will this affect you? Will you get to have an in-person graduation?,💚💚💚💚💚💚💚,Ed Vander Ploeg Hannah Vander Ploeg,Camille Maradiaga,What about spring 2020 ?,Kristen Underhill Cook,If it's outdoor why only 2 guests? 4 would be more reasonable.,Pathetic,Sarrah Holliday,Amanda Brown,🎓💚💪🏽,🎓 🎓🎓🎓🎉🎉🎉🎉👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻,🎉🎉🎉,Patti Swanson,Gabrielle Sheets !!!! 💚💚,Such great news Jack Trainor!!,Kris Turner,Great News Go Green !!!!,So envious!,Great,Maria Chene YAYYYYY😍,Great news!,GO GREEN,That’s awesome they all deserve it

MSU is planning for a more typical fall semester::: with 75% of undergraduate classes offered in person.  PRESIDENT.MSU.EDU MSU plans for more typical fall semester,2021-03-05 17:07:51,Alabama::: Mississippi::: Texas::: Montana and Iowa would be great states for students to transfer to - the ones with parents who think MSU should I open up 100%.,Thank God! My girl is really struggling with online learning. I hate thinking her freshman year has been a horrible experience for her and so many others.,Large lecture hall classes replaced by recordings that can be watched more than once... sounds like a win-win to me. Keep the smaller interactive classes in person::: the lectures can be done very well remotely regardless of the pandemic.,Great news now can we give the Tower Guard kids one more year? They deserve the same as all the athletes. Please consider this fine group of students have not even shaken each others hands.,Does typical mean refusing to honor their room assignments because they forgot to sign the covid contract? This was my son’s first year::: and he hasn’t set foot on campus. He and his friends were excited to get the fall room assignments they wanted together. They can’t wait to be on campus. My son has never been to college. He’s a typical 19 year old. He simply forgot. He contacted someone immediately after her realized his mistake. They said there was nothing they could do::: and his room with his friend was no longer available. This is shameful. Why isn’t there any grace or compassion in this unprecedented time? It is disturbing that MSU would rather ruin his experience than be flexible and understanding. Unbelievable! MSU::: you get an F for compassion!,"""...some still online::: especially those that would traditionally fill large lecture halls.""

So much snow that I ended up with a bus pass. LOL!,I lost count of the number of times I saw a cyclist ride into the side of a turning car on campus in the mid-80's. The car had the right of way. The cyclists were just watching for pedestrians and not cars.,i like what you did with the place ☺️,Come on Jay be happy for some sort of Gold status at that University!!!😀,I got run over by a bike rider from my dorm who was cruising fast down a hill. A week before my wedding. First ambulance ride. They took me to Olin Health Center. I remember it was raining and I had my umbrella which ended up around a light pole in front of the stadium. That was long before bike lanes!,Remember how crazy bike riding could be in the 60’s. I would break down and get a bus pass for winter term.,Our beautiful campus is great for riding bikes::: makes more sense than driving a car and being physically fit,I love to ride around campus on my bike. The very best time to go is a weekend morning or afternoon. Very little car and bus activity.,Geezer here - my only mode of transportation at State was this really nice Bottecchia 12 speed (I think) bike when I was there from '74 - '78. My brother (who went to UM) eventually wrecked it when I stored it at his house when I moved to west to work for the US Forest Service and then go to grad school.  Are those bike pathways still there? I remember them being only a couple of feet wide.,Here is a sign that I have never seen anywhere else. No Pedestrians. I am standing on the pedestrian sidewalk.

Only way to travel.,While walking along a trail on the banks of the red cedar::: I saw a biker run into a pedestrian. The guy picked himself up::: walked over to the rider who was off his bike::: picked up the bike and threw it into the Red Cedar. Then he calmly walked away. Wish I had a photo of the look on the rider’s face. That was probably 1969. Guessing not much has changed between bike riders and pedestrians on campus.,It was a lovely ride last week!,MSU proves that winter biking is possible. I unfortunately spoiled myself with a car on campus for my last 3 years (of 5) and had to stop riding after a surgery and getting my bike stolen.  I wish I had rode the bus more::: it was a pain paying for passes::: they should have just been included w/ tuition - as i understand it they are doing that now. I biked everywhere because i was so impatient waiting at that Shaw transfer center and one time had to get my bike lock sawed open bc of ice impeding my on-time arrival to class. MSU's on-campus bike shop is phenomenal::: I don't think any other campus has anything like it.,I rode my bike there back in the 70’s.

When a member died::: for example::: it was announced they had “Entered the Church Eternal and Everlasting.” For that reason::: I thought it gauche when I attended a service in Flint with a room mate and read in their Bulletin Mr. and Mrs. So-and-so had “Transferred Membership” to the Church Eternal and Everlasting. When I brought this to Marsha’s attention::: though::: she just shrugged and said::: “What::: it’s a Church across town!” 50 year later::: she’s still a valued friend.

Complete nonsensical experimental garbage.  Does not stop transmission.  Has not had a long term safety study.  Has not been proven to protect you.  Significant reports of SEVERE side effects such as Bell’s palsy and death.  Has not been tested on unhealthy people.  What are we suppose to be excited about?  I’m a little tired of this endless promotion calling everyone a hero.,Thank you Addyson and the many other Spartan Alums who are part of the Pfizer vaccine team!,Why the mean comment? What degree do you have and what are you doing with it? I admire her for her education and the important work she is doing that is helping protect us from covid.,Thank you.

Masks are nothing more than a mind control device. Promoted by the government and the MSM. They “you decide who they are” have turned the world upside down. Trying to save us from something that::: if we didn’t know better was a bad case of the flu. Never mind the numbers of folks who died of heart attacks::: cancer::: diabetes etc. Before you get all righteous on me. I was just released from a 17 day hospital stay for Covid. 1 liter of O2 away from having to be vented. The doctors didn’t treat the Covid they treated the lungs. Still on O2 but am getting better each day.  The irony of this ? The hospital had 3 yes 3 Covid patients in my duration.  Turn the nation upside down. Ruin people’s livelihoods. Close the restaurants but keep Walmart open.  Screw you for being blindly led on. Screw your mask.

Mat Ishbia::: a former Michigan State Basketball player::: has made a $32M commitment to Michigan State Spartans. Thank you::: Mat!  DETROITNEWS.COM Mat Ishbia::: former basketball player::: makes $32M donation to Michigan State athletics,2021-02-04 18:50:53,This is indeed a rare loyal Spartan who feels grateful to MSU for the basketball training and exposure he had during his time! We look forward to more Spartans who have been or are now in the professional sports will have similar grateful spirit as shown by Mat Ishbia!,Some of this should be going to save the swim and dive team. All athletes should benefit. Amen,Such a wonderful gesture! Indirectly::: it will help all Michigan State sports.,It’s great that he did that::: but I would like to know why did he take over a portion of ultimate soccer in Pontiac and close down 2 of the best indoor fields they had if he “loves” sports so much,So proud of the contributions Spartans are making to the world.,Awesome! Does that free up any money that can now go to Swimming & Diving?,Hopefully it goes to Olympic sports like Swim and Dive which have been cut.,“The residual amount of the commitment will create the MSU Athletics Excellence Fund to both provide flexible::: unrestricted resources that can address needs and take advantage of new opportunities as they arise.”Like the Swimming Program!!!!!,I agree with Sarah’s post! Lots of talented kids are sidelined because of the decision to eliminate this fine sport. Putting it back a bit of Mr. Ishbia’s millions makes such good sense. Let’s Go Green!!!,This is wonderful news. Wish we could find a benefactor to finish Munn Arena and help the swimming/ diving program,Why not benefit more students and the public in general by funding SCIENCE programs like Abrams Planetarium!!!!,I'm a Spartan with mixed emotion on this. I can't help but think about those who need help getting to college::: getting job training::: getting healthy diets::: safe housing. I agree with others who would like to see programs like the swim program and other sports re-instated. Obviously it's his money and he has made a generous donation.,Great ... thought also Eli Broad donated 50 Million for the Business College...good when you achieve success ... you give back. Go Spartans..,Very generous. Thank you! 💚 I::: too::: would also like the University to reconsider cutting Swimming. These student athletes may not have won the Big Ten Championship::: but the women had the best GPA of any swim team in the country. The men had the 6th best GPA in the country::: behind Harvard and Stanford. Does this not also embody what it means to be a student athlete? Maybe the swim team doesn’t generate money but they also don’t cost a lot. A new aquatic center would benefit the entire student body. When I attended MSU I swam laps not worked out on the football field.,I remember chanting his name when he took the court in the final minutes of the game::: “Ishbia! Ishbia! Ishbia!” We have great reason to do it agin! 💚🤍💚,Would be nice if this went to a scholarship fund for all students::: instead of another athletic department contribution.,This is yet another testament to Tom Izzo’s impact on his players::: community and Michigan State University.,Nice that he gave back and hope some small portions help the business school who really made him who he is .,"Thank you Mat but I'm sure you will be accused of exercising your possible use of white privilege ""if it applies"" for doing this during BHM. just saying",Awesome Mat! But Michigan State University we’re saying upgrades to football dining facilities over the swimming and diving program?,"What a guy!! He was a ""fan favorite"" at the Bres when we watched him play and lead. Proud to be a Spartan!",Michigan is not just a university::: it is a worldwide Spartan family I'm looking forward to participating in this noble institution.❤,Dang might be richest player Izzo ever produced and never played a day of pro ball!

Nice to see you having such success in your life and sharing your generosity with others.,Sounds like enough for a Swimming program!!,Will it lower tuition? I doubt it.,Just be happy that he gave back to MSU!! Stop trying to put it where you think it should go! Not your money!,WOW!!! Amazing!!! UWM steps ups HUGE ...  Let's see Quicken and its Spartan Alumni jump in the game.  Help save Swimming and Diving!!,I love how people are telling a man:::who is donating his money::: how to spend it. The amount of cry for swimming and diving was needed years ago not in hindsight of them being shut down after this year. Instead of yelling on a Facebook post try and raise money to maybe keep the program alive,Why is it sports gets these large donations?,Absolutely amazing that about half of these comments can criticize a donation of this size because it doesn't fit into their idea of what should be done with it. IT'S NOT YOUR MONEY! Thank you Mat Ishbia!,Imagine how many tuition bills could be paid with that 🙃 But yes::: a new weight room.,This exemplifies what is wrong with American culture in general. Priorities are all screwed up.,Awesome Spartan! Go Green!,Way to give back to a University that gave you your start!!! Thank You Mat! Spartans.....lo ok to his co for a mortgage.,Extremely generous! Go Green! 👍🏻🇺🇸,How did he make that much money in less than two decades?,Maybe the university can use this to save some of their athletic programs that have dropped or are planning to drop.,Love he is giving back to MSU!,Reinstate Swim and Dive now that you have ✨money✨,Wow::: how great is that to be able to donate so much money to MSU!,Hysterical::: bunch of penny-less fools giving financial and charitable donation advice to a self-made billionaire. Go Green!,So the regular career development center isn't good enough for the athletes?,That is true love for your almamater!,Thank you Mat!! Outstanding gift!,WHY athletics?? Why not scholarships??,This article makes no mention if any of this will go to fund anything related to academics - as in...hmmmm::: scholarships perhaps?,That's a whole lotta Go Green!,What does he do for living to have that kind of money to donate?!?!,It is unbelievable contribution👍,Now the funds should be there to save spartan SWIMMING AND DIVING. A 32million dollar donation goes a long way.,Wow. Surely students today will benefit from such a gracious donation. Thank you sir!,Fantastic! I remember seeing the WE WISHBIA ISHBIA WOULD PLAY sign in the Izzone 😄,Way to give it back Mat!!!!!! 👊🏼,You are a true Philanthropist::: giving back your school!,good thing basketball and seldom money too much is sport club:::s and yet over this time where now today.usa::: finland and others land.ok::: i speak.amen,Thank you sir!

I graduated from MSU in 2009 with an MS in Criminal Justice with a focus on security management. At the time::: I was a program manager (Protective Security Advisor) with the US Department of Homeland Security while working in Houston::: TX. Clearly::: an on-line grad program might not be the best solution for all disciplines. I'll confess that I had to enroll in the University of Houston::: where I also completed an MA program in criminology::: to better negotiate the qualitative and quantitative statistics modules as trying to teach myself statistics in an on-line forum just wasn't going to work for me. The department chair::: Dr. Mahesh Nala::: was a joy to work with and I value my relationship with MSU greatly.,I thought Supply Chain graduate degree was highly ranked.

Makes me proud to be a MSU alum.,Go green!,Go Green!! ❤,This is a good concept::: but don't forget rural Michigan. How can this or similar programs be made available to kids in Bad Axe::: Edmore::: Mio or Escanaba ?,"Say what you want about ""racial injustice:::"" et al::: but this is a great idea. Students of color are far more likely to be denied high-end STEM education. They're not forcibly denied::: no one is telling them they can't have it::: but the resources simply don't exist in that area. (And let's face it-\-\we've been mentioning that to the government for about 60 years now and nothing's changed::: so...) So for Apple to bring it there is a great thing.",F that. Apple is mediocre. All they care about is money::: and their tech knowledge is subpar....this isn't exactly news but don't bring that crap to my home state....,To late for Detroit. I don’t see anyway::: anyone::: including Apple putting a dent in a totally whacked out town. This idea of creating all these sport venues::: when the Town can’t even field a consistently winning team is ludicrous. And worst of all::: the glamour towns::: B’ham::: the Bloomfield’s::: are looking ragged and tired around the edges. Shame on Apple::: could have stepped up years ago and maybe made a noticeable improvement. Now that they are “woke”::: it’s already way to late to make a difference.,Will they be teaching them how to steal other inventor's patented technology::: as well? #VIRNETX,How about one up north where they don’t have anything like that ever. Our kids are left out all time.,hope this works out. good luck to everybody!,Only liberals will be allowed to join.,Ryan Wood did you see this?

The MSU Board of Trustees and President Stanley have issued a statement on yesterday's violence at the U.S. Capitol. http://go.msu.edu/r8p,2021-01-07 16:48:30,Very disappointed that my alma mater could not issue a strong statement condemning this violence towards the foundation of our democracy by storming the Capitol. That statement is ridiculous in these times. Truth trumps lies.,Wow! As an African American MSU alumnus::: I am so disappointed in many comments here. Wasn't it Dr. Martin Luther King::: Jr. who said::: he wasn't disappointed in the violence of evil people::: but the silence of good people?,Pull together like this?,Where was all the concern when the country was being burned down the last year?,Your opinion is absolutely unnecessary::: your radical teachings are already taking the country in the wrong direction. Don’t pick and choose your targets based on their affiliations!,Why not bring this up when every dem ran city in America was burning ??!,Thank you B oT and President Stanley for trying to bring the Spartan community together.,All Spartans should stand for equality and justice. How people were treated during the BLM protests during the summer and how domestic terrorists were treated yesterday says volumes about our country::: our problems and our political system. Stand for what is right::: stand against and work to eliminate the inequalities across our country::: and call out those who abuse their power. #SpartansWill,No matter what your political leanings are - I’m shocked at how many fellow Spartans are not denouncing these horrific::: violent attacks on our Nation’s Capitol . Republicans and Democrats in the Senate and House of Reps as well as the Vice President of the U.S. were in the Capitol and under violent attack.  All violent attacks should be condemned— period.,Whether or not one agrees with the statement::: I'm curious as to why the BOT and President Stanley felt it necessary to address this situation in this manner. Seems a bit of an overreach::: IMO.,Without sifting thru these 2000 plus comments::: I pray that all MSU educated alums find yesterday's events and the people behind them despicable::: and there actions treasonous,Better watch yourself.... you aren’t going to keep thriving from the dollars sent in by your students. You need your alumni base. My humble opinion would be focus on educating these kids about their chosen major and protecting young women from rapist - especially the ones you employ.,Took all the college money I had saved for the kids to go to MSU and put it into tangibles. Not paying for the indoctrination of radical left ideology into them. Instead I'm going to help them into skilled trades. Much better ROI in my opinion.,This is a general statement but have not read the full statement. However::: a school shouldn't be mandating a flu vaccine! ....and only to students on top of it? UPDATED: It does get controversial::: not everyone believes it was a fair election and we do currently have the right to express opinions and protest on due diligence not taking place. MSU::: my student is 4th generation and family even has deeper ties I won't get into but you are pushing my loyalty and love big time....never dreamed I would be disappointed and and disheartened with you at this level of wanting my student to transfer out after dreaming of them attending and carrying on the family lineage. Please stay out of politics and our health decisions! My student has even said if you mandate at any time::: the C19 vaccine he is out of there!,Everyone who think colleges are liberal hotbeds just needs to count all the racists on this thread.  This is a non statement and all you MAGA snowflakes are crying,Open ended statement.... is Michigan State University For or Against the protests????? Sounds like they can't commit and are trying NOT to be held accountable for their words.,Personally::: as an alumnus::: I really don’t care to hear your position on this matter. You do enough damage indoctrinating the students with your liberal views. Frankly::: what MSU once was it is no longer! I would NEVER send my children there.,Where’s the statement went BLM and antifa burned down cities for weeks,Totally agree. Equality means just that-equality for ALL. No white privilege for me if I do something that a black person cannot.,Where was this statement when the entire country burned and rioted over the summer? Too little::: too late.,Cool! So you are condemning all violence now? Or only the violence in DC? Asking for a friend.,Sadly::: it appears to me that my beloved school has become an institute of higher indoctrination rather than higher education.,Where was your statement when all the rioting and looting and killing and violence went on this summer? There wasn't one was there?,"All violent::: destructive::: burning or looting demonstrations are bad. America is better than this. In the words of Ozzy Osbourne ""The media sells it::: and you live the roles"".",Why wasn’t it time to pull together and reaffirm our commitment to our best ideals when ANTIFA and BLM were trashing and burning our cities throughout this past year?,You can get away with pushing your indoctrination on our youth::: but it’s not gonna fly with truly savvy and educated adults. This post was a bad move.,Time for Stanley to leave! MSU has become a leftist indoctrination camp and diploma mill.,This is the best they can come up with? embarrassing and.shameful. will changing time,The university and board are weak!!  Stop the pandering!! They will never get another dollar from me.,So like collecting tuition from students and then two days later telling them they have to stay home? Or charging students full tuition for online instruction instead of in person? Mandating a flu vaccine to all students before they return. Yes some ideals,Pull together BUT THINK about what YOU teach. Teach understanding your MAJOR and what your Country needs of you. Be ONE area of understanding.,If this were a re-post::: I’d wholeheartedly agree. But it’s not.  Timing is everything.,The millenial students have been indoctrinated. They should ask themselves why is a university getting involved in politics and taking sides now::: when it turned a blind eye to blm and antifa riots for the last year. I am ashamed of MSU.,Words are nice::: what concrete actions will MSU take?,Wow; from the comments I would say MSU getting scratched off the bequest lists in wills.,Where was their statement on BLM destroying our country?  Pathetic. #### like this makes me embarrassed to be a Spartan.,Oh we have to come together? What happened to the last four years::: when we needed to come together::: so what happened yesterday::: would not have happened??,"God forbid you take a stand and say::: ""It was wrong::: don't do that::: Spartans.""",Thanks MSU::: please open up some of your woke safe spaces to the community that may be hurting,Why would we listen to a college whose coaches molest their athletes?,Where was this statement after the Larry Nassar Scandal?,"What the hell are you talking about? ""Free and fair election?"" Hahaha. This fascist regime is unacceptable. I'm watching a coup unfold on my TV.",We pay people to mumble like that?,Could this possibly say less? :(,Shoot now I have to snooze MSU because of hate from both sides. Makes me mad,Sadly::: time to unfollow my alma mater😕,THE SPARTY HELMET & THE STATUE OF LIBERTY CROWN BOTH HAVE A BALD EAGLE RESTING COMFORTABLY ATOP !!,Better to clean your own house before saying someone else needs cleaning!!! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸,Something about people living in glass houses comes to mind.,And burn some couches,You know where you can stick your unity 🖕,I think we can all agree protest that ends in::: breaking in to any type of building::: burning::: or looting::: it’s not right and unacceptable.! What people are tired of is the media biased and hypocritical reporting!!!,Have you issued statements on the more violent riots for last 8 months condemning it?,Stanley panders to moronic ideals. I don’t recall any statements this summer over the weeks of rioting::: looting::: and senseless mayhem in Portland::: Seattle::: and elsewhere against numerous police and federal facilities. Why not??? Please convince me Stanley and the BoT are good for MSU. One poor decision or position after another. Disgusting!!,Did they put out a statement a few months ago when city’s were on fire ??? Asking for a friend 🤷‍♂️,I bleed Green....but WTF does that even MEAN???,Stick to teaching not politics::: better educate theses kids and let them know::: that if you are wealthy enough and have the right connections::: you can steal a presidency::: I don’t care if some don’t agree::: because of their hate for president Trump::: but that is exactly what happened.,So you will be supporting the arrests and prosecution of the antifa and leftist infiltrators who committed the crimes. Very good.,Kimberly Wa,Jim Beckley,Robin Boles,Sad to see so many Spartan alum side with the domestic terrorists. Every real American should take a stand against that attack orchestrated by Trump. Proud of the leadership team for being vocal::: ashamed of some spartans who have joined the cult involved in this attack. Ignorance from less educated people is expected but I expect better from my fellow educated Spartans.,Stay out of politics! Where were you during the rioting & looting of BLM & Antifa. Your job as a university is to educate our children in the area of their major::: not spew your left-wing agenda! Stick to teaching. Our children can form their own opinions::: without your brainwashing!,Where was this statement when BLM and Antifa burned::: looted and destroyed multiple major cities over past several months. At least be consistent.,Like 'One person::: one vote'? That best ideal?,Bug off you virtue signaling liars. Lets all remember you turned a blind eye while Nassar was molesting over 2000 girls,You wonder why things are going backwards::: ???,Call out the complete voter system and anyone involved..,All you Trump cult::: deplorable followers::: trying to equate this to BLM protests is trying to equate apples to oranges. Didn't you see the difference the Federal troops presents was with the BLM march in DC and the Trump::: cult insurrection? It wouldn't make a difference to you as you are in worship of an idol. You will suffer in hell.,Dizzo is playing follow the leader.,Your problem is this antifa and blm are Terrorists groups.and your support this. MSU sucks,Agreed,I honestly thought that Trump was smarter than that.,The flag of treason that Michiganders gave their last full measure of devotion fighting against was carried in the hallowed halls of our nation's Capital yesterday. It's time to remove a traitor and his enablers from our country's honored offices and hold them accountable. Then we can hunt down the dogs that invaded our country's house and put them in cages. Michigan stood tall in 1861::: now traitors have attacked not only the state Capital::: they have ransacked the National Capital. On June 16::: 1978::: I stood in Demonstration Hall on our campus::: raised my right hand and swore an Oath to support and defend the Constitution of the USA as a brand new US Army 2LT::: an oath this president and many republican members just violated. When will real Michigan Patriots put an end to this treason?,https:// www.youtube.com/ watch?v=61pMtsWx Qrs&ab_channel= MarcRebillet,We all are one,Agreed!,Bye!,Spartans Will!! God Bless America! Stand Up for Justice and Equality. Go Green!!,Democratic teaching is wrong.,Vern.

Established in 1873::: MSU's Beal Garden is the oldest continuously operated university botanical garden of its kind in the U.S. http://go.msu.edu/38p,2020-12-29 14:00:00,It was always a great place of tranquility and to catch a breath of fresh air after studying in the library. 💚,Best part of campus and worthy of a read about the formation of the garden and addition of plant species.

Thanks M.S.U. !,My husband and I had sorely wanted to get married in the garden but it was limited to 50 people back then. Our guests numbered 175 that included 100-125 family members. The head gardener in the 1980s was so wonderful. I met him a couple of times in the early mornings. I still plant viburnums everywhere I move in his honor as he told me about them after I remarked to him about their beautiful scent. The bush in the garden was remarkable in size and just to the east at the edge of the garden by the Women's IM. Just a beautiful beautiful place.

MSU researchers have received $2.1 million in grant funding to test wastewater statewide for early COVID-19 detection. #SpartansWill  MSUTODAY.MSU.EDU MSU to test wastewater statewide for early COVID-19 detection,2020-12-14 14:00:01,What a waste of money.,Early testing in other communities (universities) has proven beneficial in early identification and isolation of asymptotic::: positive patients. It’s showing to be a effective tool when testing of individuals within communities isn’t possible or effective.,MSU’s early detection program will be able to target testing to dorms and apartment buildings that have tested positive via wastewater testing. Most of us will not be getting a vaccine any time soon. This will keep the campus safe and allow people to come to work a lot sooner. Additionally::: learning about this will help us in the NEXT PANDEMIC!!,More to learn here. Seems like an early warning measure especially with the rate of asymptomatics. Research will help with future pandemics...and there will be more.,So you’re finding ways to test people without their consent? 🖕🏻,Seems irrelevant with vaccines coming online. More governmental pork.,How about 2.1 million to decrease the ridiculously expensive tuition for a STATE school.,Isn't this coming a little late given the introduction of vaccines?,Insert COVID into any dumb proposal... Get fully funded,Prior state studies have shown that you can predict a spike from the waste water.,What an absolute waste of resources..,They say they're in dire need of a federal bailout but they have money for this? C'mon man!,Im going to be a grant funding writer,Report has been released - 68%! No words...  https:// beta.documentclo ud.org/ documents/ 20423772-antrim- county-forensic s-report,Maybe they should fix Flint::: Michigan first ...,Wasteful....giv e $ to feed people !,I never even thought this could be an issue,Testing wastewater must be extremely expensive.,Don’t be stupid!!! the money is not really for what they are saying it’s for Just like everything else that’s funded in 2020 with the pandemic,The coronavirus hasn't been found in drinking water. If it does get into the water supply::: your local water treatment plant filters and disinfects the water::: which should kill any germs.,So they’re checking poop? That’s a crappy job.,Another idiotic idea from the dems,Apparently a coke tests positive.,Some of the people will refuse to take the vaccine.,What about money for fixing flint water?,Government is now testing both ends of each citizen.....,Lower tuition got the students who are learning thru a computer anyways,Give it up for heaven’s sake. You’re just looking more idiotic.,Phylicia Bailey maybe that’s why your water there is crap 🤷🏼‍♀️,#WhataboutFlint,How about putting that money to use by fixing the water in Flint???,Go fix Flint!,I see Jerry Garcia in the water,Katie Steeves Herrick Steeves,Why?,Its wastewater tho....,Waste of 2million..,GREAT! 👍,If they look at you at all then you become positive.,Kayla,TIL people hate clean water 🙄,You’ve got to be kidding......,OMG it’s in the water?,Grace Whitney interesting project.,Ross Sherman,Ethan Tippett

MSUTODAY.MSU.EDU Fall 2020 commencement ceremonies to be held virtually,2020-12-04 14:00:04,Would have been nice if Spring 2020 had something even close to this?,How exciting! Will MSU be announcing the names of all the graduates? We are so proud of our niece Caprice Wilcox and can’t wait to hear her name! Congrats to all the graduates at MSU who have worked so hard over these years ::: especially this year::: to get where they are today! You deserve to be recognized ! Go Green! 💚,Wow! Great list of alumni speakers......,Spring 2020 got crap. Be thankful for some speakers.,MSU::: the best!,Savanna Maefield,Tyler Easterbrook,Kate Leon,😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍,MSU should still be having different commencement ceremonies for fall 2020 undergraduates for each college and announce each students name out loud as would normally be done in person. So disappointed they are just doing one large one. It’s the easy way out.,Tariq Williams looking forward to seeing your name!

Scientists from MSU and University of Maryland are contributing to a massive new effort to name millions sold into bondage during the transatlantic slave trade.

Beginning in fall 2021::: MSU's on-campus living requirement will be extended to include a second year.  MSUTODAY.MSU.EDU University reinstates second-year on-campus living requirement,2020-12-01 22:09:50,Sure hope this doesn’t include students who deferred 2020 and will be transferring credits in for fall 2021. My daughter already signed a lease in EL::: as did several of her friends.,They don’t have enough university housing to support this. It’s MSU just trying to make money to cover what they owe do to their horrific handling of Larry Nasser!,Total garbage. Let's just keep burying our youth in more and more debt by forcing them to take out more and more ridiculous student loans to cover insane room and board costs. My off campus apartment/ grocery/utility bills were so much more affordable than the room and board fees::: and I wasn't stuck living in a 12'×12' room with community toilets.,As an alumni this disappoints me. The cost of the meal plan when I was required to live on campus was absurd - something like $500+/ month!!!! The students that are required to live on campus should not be required to purchase an unlimited meal plan. Such a money grab and so unfair to students who have no other option. ***Edited to add that I just checked and the meal plans are all over $3000/ semester!!!!! You could eat at five star restaurants every day for that price.,Such a disappointment. Today’s youth do NOT need one more year of coddling. Let them move out::: learn to prepare food::: manage monthly rent::: utilities::: and groceries. I am a proud alumni and proud parent of a 2021 freshman and could not be more disgusted with this money grab. 👎,Fall semester is 4 months (give or take). Cost of standard housing for one semester is $5:::236. That's $1:::309 a month. Even the most expensive off campus housing options cost hundreds less. MSU is getting over on students and they know it!!,First you force them to stay home::: tell them not to get an appartment in East Lansing::: (like it's in your authority)::: cancel all the things that make college life great. It feels like we are getting a community college education at a big 10 price and now you want to force them back on campus for another year. No thank you.,I love MSU but come on. Tuition is out of sight. Kids are starting their lives after college so far in debt. How much money do you need MSU? This is not acceptable,Where exactly do you plan to put all these students? I graduated in 2016::: lived on all 4 years (and loved it). There was not a single empty room on any of the floors I lived on. I don't know how you are going to fit all these people in dorms that are already full.,I had a choice to go here. I’m so glad I picked GVSU.  You willingly overcharge on tuition and then force students to pay to live on campus. If you cared for your students at all::: you’d consider their overall financial well-being.,"Does any MSU administrator making these decisions have an actual business background (not academia)? How about cutting costs first and talking about those efforts (bloated administration::: for starters)? Ouch. Hurts too much::: doesn't it. Did the trustees approve this? You say you ""care about students."" Start with current online/remote students and try harder to make more classes in person. Those ""efforts"" have been paltry at best. MSU::: you're not reading the room well right now. Your timing on this: terrible. And the two-year on campus decision itself: ridiculous. Do better.",This is nothing else but an additional money grab on the students. It is that simple. As a msu grad I am extremely disappointed in this announcement. Shame on you sparty. Show some integrity. At least be honest that this is to shore up university finances.,This is so transparently about milking students for more money. With the student debt crisis so severe::: this is a ridiculous move. I only had to pay to live on campus for one year and I’m still paying off my loans. Two full years of room and board would’ve been unmanageable.,I enjoyed my experience on MSU’s campus sophomore year however forcing students into it is a blatant money grab::: along with every other college expense. It was much cheaper to split my rent amongst several people::: utilities included. It’s the same trash logic telling students to shell out for a textbook that “will be required.”,The campus is beautiful ... but the campus also already lacks many amenities students living on campus need. Just look at Rec Facilities::: they are easily the worst among Big Ten schools and other comparable Universities around the country. MSU continues to show a lack of strategy and transparency that the students::: parents and faculty deserve.,Bad decision MSU...you are making it based on revenue::: not what’s best for the student...let the students decide if two years is best. You may have lost a Freshman...plea se reconsider.,Absolute garbage move. The answer to the university’s financial problems shouldn’t be to make the cost of a degree more expensive. MSU making the best possible case for the community college system with this announcement.,Terrible::: terrible decision!! C’mon new President Stanley; you’re supposed to be a visionary!! Nothing but a $ grab since MSU can’t adjust their finances to the reality of covid!!😫,I’m disappointed in my alma mater. Had this been the rule while I was attending::: I could not have afforded to stay. Not only is it more expensive to live on campus::: but it’s also difficult to hold an off campus job when options for parking on campus are slim to non-existent.,As an Alum::: I feel this is a mistake. I did much better the 3 years I lived off campus. I could better manage distractions::: it was easier to have an off-campus job::: and I had more direct control of my expenses and could split them with roommates. On Campus housing should be a reasonably priced option for those who truly need it.,Wow::: how absolutely horrible. MSU is referencing a meager 2.5% graduation rate increase as a component facilitator to this decision? Total BS. This is clearly a cash grab. Unless you make room and board considerably more affordable and get creative to provide further incentives::: I strongly urge MSU to reconsider. The burdening student loan debt carried by students because of this policy will only get worse if you don’t.,As a parent of three MSU grads. I like the idea. I think it is a great way for students to get to know each other and have less responsibility related to apartment living. Those apartments and houses certainly are not inexpensive and I never liked the way that they make the kids commit to a lease 9 months in advance.  Some of the Ivy League schools have students live in dorms for all four years. I think there are some good things about that.,I agree with this. A community with a bit of peer supervision can help keep kids from making some mistakes. It's for the kids well being.,As an alumni::: I::: too::: am disappointed in this decision. Indeed it is a money grab. Dorm living plus meal plan is very expensive. I’d suggest they reconsider. Please don’t expect next years students to make up for a budget shortfall.,I lived in the dorms two years and it was a great decision. However::: if you are going to require this you better be spending this time with no students updating the dorms because when my daughter moved to Akers it was exactly as it was when I was a student and it was disgusting then. My son lived in Hubbard last year and there were some tiny upgrades but bathrooms and tile were about 50 years old. The dorms at MSU are a big deterrent as most schools across the country have very nice::: modern dorms.,Unless you want to have an apartment many miles away from campus it is actually cheaper to live in the dorm. My daughter and a neighbor kid both went to MSU at the same time. My daughter stayed in the dorms and the neighbor moved off campus. Upon comparing prices::: it was cheaper - only slightly::: but still cheaper - to live in the dorm. The apartments right next to campus are very costly.,"This is absolutely ridiculous. We are already struggling financially and you're just holding us under. Forcing people to live in a 12 by 12 square box and expect them to exceed academically and mentally is garbage. We are adults let us decide where we want to live while we pay you thousands of dollars for a ""world class education""",I spent my entire time at MSU in the dorms (residence halls::: whatever)::: it was worth it for: unlimited hot water in the showers::: and nearness to most of the classroom buildings. I would have 15 minute walks to class::: while off-campus friends::: in bad weather::: would need that much time just to get to campus. To each their own of course::: I think the 2nd year requirement is a bit much.,If you aren't in one of the true 4 year programs like James Madison or Nursing::: go to community college for first two years to save money on credits and housing then transfer in.,As an Alumni::: I think this is a mistake. Although I support students living on campus::: as part of the experience::: not everyone can afford to live on campus. This could force students to attend other colleges.,Totally disagree. Students should have the choice of where they thrive. Even the first year is questionable.,Ugh. While I loved living in the dorms and met all my lifelong friends there::: no way would we have survived a second year,Very disappointed this is what they want to do.... Freshman year should be enough. I agree with many of the comments.....mu st be about the money. So sad. :(,Yes::: they have to make up the losses of what happened this year. So by forcing students to STAY 2 years.... just a stepping stone to grab students to spend more money. 🤦🏼‍♀️,This will be a deterrent for those who cannot afford to pay top dollar for another year on campus. When I was a student - the cost of living in the dorms with a required meal plan cost significantly more than living off campus with roommates. I hope it’s more affordable for future Spartans if this is required.,I didn’t realize that there was enough housing available to mandate 2 years for students.,Bad decision. Staying in the dorm 2:::3:::4 years is good for those that choose it. But if it is a requirement::: you are going to have people both parents and students thinking twice if MSU is a good fit:::,Meal plan is mostly required and very expensive. Also they should’ve used this year to remodel the dorms! Or at least the bathrooms.,Each student thrives in different environments. Please don’t take the choice away::: potentially punishing those who need a different environment than what dorm life has to offer. My daughter who started at MSU in 2019 needed to get out of the dorm::: have her space and cook her own meals. My son is strongly considering MSU next year.. he may be better suited to staying on campus two years::: I’m not sure. But they should have the CHOICE. I think the dorms need upgrades if you are requiring students to pay more money to MSU and live on campus for two years. MSU dorms were the most outdated of any campus we visited. And the water quality needs to be improved as well::: no excuse for a university of this caliber to have the water quality issues it has. Please::: if you are asking these students to invest in one more year on campus...invest in improving the living experience for them. Fair is fair.,This was such a mistake. I have saved thousands - and I’m not kidding - thousands of dollars by moving off campus. I paid half the money for a fully furnished apartment with my own bedroom and bathroom compared to the price MSU charges for room and board... Literally half the cost for more amenities. This is a downhill decline. Definitely going to deter future students - who wants to be forced into a $25K deal just in 2 years on room and board alone? So unfair. Sad.,What happens if you already signed an off campus lease since they said there would Not be a requirement next year to live on campus,Sounds like a money grab. Disappointing.,This is to make up for the shortfall of 2020 dorm revenue. Do not agree.,How about they are adults and should decide what is right for them themselves?,I actually would have preferred my son to be on campus rather than Cedar Village::: just saying. It would’ve been cheaper and he would’ve/ could’ve eaten better.,Absolutely hilarious how MSU is trying to play this off as “an academic initiate to improve students educations”. This is a complete money grab::: nothing else.,That's not right MSU...figure out a different way to make up lost Covid revenue...don't put it on the students...I mean parents.,As someone who chose to live on campus two years this is a horrendous decision. The cost of on campus living is insane::: and certainly not the best choice for everyone.,I loved living on campus for two years when I attended MSU but think this is a huge mistake. Times are different and off campus housing options are significantly better these days; not to mention it will hurt the Greek system for those who choose to go that route.,When you realize the school is actually that desperate,Although part of me wished I had lived in the dorms a second year::: financially it wasn’t the best move. I was paying for college myself. Taking away this choice is all about money and is unfair for students/ families who are in a difficult financial situation. This is the wrong move if you want to make college accessible for lower income students. I am disappointed by my alma mater.,This is ridiculous. What about all of the students who already signed a lease for next year?,Having to share a bedroom with somebody was tolerable for 1 year::: but I can barely imagine having to do that for 2. This decision makes the live action Last Airbender movie look Oscar-worthy,That's a disappointing choice. I had to move off campus in my 2nd year because I didn't have enough aid to cover room and board. If I was required to live on campus I would've had to drop out 😢 (and that was back in 2001 when costs were much lower),This seals the deal that my high school senior will not be attending MSU!,Making up for lost revenue on students backs. Disappointing.,I lived in the dorms there for 2 years and loved the experience. However::: I'm wondering how they think they're going to accomplish this? I started my freshman year in transitional housing (5 people in a 4 person room) and it definitely felt cramped for that first month or so until they found a normal room with an empty bed. Don't see how you can swing it with all sophomores being forced to stay in the dorms as well,Yuck::: so glad I graduated from undergrad in 2011 before this policy was reinstated. It was fun living in a dorm for one year::: but I was so happy to live in a house the remaining three years.,I loved living in the dorms at MSU::: but midway through sophomore year I realized it was destroying my budget. I didn't want to move off-campus; I had to so I could afford to finish school. If MSU wants to live up to its Land Grant mission::: it has to make room for economic diversity. Not every student has a parent footing their bills.,That's ridiculous! C'mon MSU I expect better than this terrible attempt at a money grab. As a proud graduate I am severely disappointed and feel bad for those students.,I stayed on campus 3 or my 4 years there. Then I actually commuted another semester from the Flint area. I had a lot of great experiences living on campus. I did have a lot of help with my parents helping me::: or mostly paying for::: my college education. I don’t think it’s a bad decision::: but I do agree that it should be the students choice. I don’t regret mine. Just enjoy the time you’re there::: it flies by quicker than you think.,Completely ridiculous greed ::: my son spent his first year in the dorm and that was more than enough ::: at a cost of $1000 a month for a non air conditioned walk in closet ::: students don’t need any more obstacles in their way than they already have.,Dress it up however you want::: but it is clearly a money grab,Thank goodness this doesn’t affect my kids - they were so ready to get out of those dorms,Clearly the beautiful newly constructed apartment buildings in East Lansing are attracting students off campus. MSU will have none of that! This decision is about their bottom line. The students are adults; give them the freedom to choose.,Love MSU but like every college::: it's all about the money. You want to force students to live on campus and say it is because studies show 2 percent more on campus student graduate then off campus. Have you ever considered it's a money issue on why they dont graduate? Besides most 3rd and 4th year students do live off campus it only makes sense that group would see lower graduation rates. You also charge a ton for parking on campus making it difficult for commuters. This is a money grab and nothing more. Very disappointed to see this. You have already priced higher education well outside the financial scope of most families all while the average income hasn't risen to match it. Your 300 percent higher then 2000 when I graduated. Not to mention were are they going to live? 2 in a room in most dorm rooms is tight::: are you going to jam 3 in a room? I had 2 others in a room in emmons hall and they had big rooms and it was still tight.,How does that affect Greek life and sophomores living in the sorority/ fraternity house?,Bad idea. My daughter who just graduated from MSU this past May hated living in the dorms. They are badly in need of updating. She stayed in the Mason dorms. The rooms are way too small::: no a/c::: spotty Wifi::: the common areas::: rooms & furniture are badly in need of an upgrade. She was much happier living off campus.,This Spartan is not a fan of this decision. My food-allergic kid was already planning to transfer in after a year of community college::: since he can't eat cafeteria food. Looks like he'll be reconsidering MSU altogether.,MSU has cancelled a number of student wellness projects because the funding is being used for lawsuit settlements instead. I wouldn’t expect any major improvements to the dorms for years to come.,Gotta recoup their Covid costs by sucking money from student housing. Maybe lay off on building million dollar business school pavilions and such?,Total BS! I commuted for years and it did t reduce my education. If anything ::: MSU worked against me completing my degree!,This was the rule when I entered as a freshman back in 1968. Lived in Abbot Hall for two years.,If all you people don’t like MSU then don’t go there. You don’t have to be so negative about something you can just avoid in your life. I just don’t get why everyone has to be so negative these days. 🤦‍♀️!,First they waited until the week before students were set to move in this fall to announce classes were online and now this... they will do anything to screw these kids out of their money,"Funny::: my GPA actually got higher after I moved off campus.  One of the biggest reasons I moved off campus was price. I assume the'll have some kind of ""price match system"" for those who claim they can't afford to live on campus? ;-)",How is this not just a grasp for money,So attempt to boost graduation rates so they can then be riddled with student debt after?! Yikes.,When I was in school the rule for women was until 21. I didn't t turn 21 until fall of my senior year.. Agree that you can save money on for it you cook yourself.,I went to Ferris and was required to live on campus for 2 years. I didn’t think much of it and didn’t realize this was not common (or maybe it was and times have changed as that was in 2004-2005),Requirement? Yikes. Glad this doesn’t apply to me. Hated dorm life and was far too expensive. This + flat rate tuition...Man they’re desperate for money.,When I started there I was 4 months shy of being 21 (a freshman too). They only made me live on campus for my 1st semester::: which was fine but I was happy to move off campus!,While other schools are INVESTING in their students::: Sparty keeps milking them and coming up short. Who is running this crazy train? Cutting programs (MSU Swim & Dive) that generates $ and brings students in::: no updated on-campus Rec center to provide any sort of physical & mental health benefits (and sense of community).. Now this?!? C’mon Green::: you can do better. 👎🏼,Will they bring back kegs like the ‘80s?,I spent two years in student housing by choice. It shouldn't be required. Poorly justified and thinly veiled financial decision. BSUP '93,Trying to make up for lost revenue in 2020. Boo. College is expensive enough already,Good thing my newly-admitted kid hasn’t committed yet. This will likely be the thing that helps her pick another university.,Clearly this is a war between all the new apartment complexes around EL and Lans and MSU and their dorms.,I think the student and the parents can decide where he/she lives. Every situation is different.,Stephanie Bagwell are they required to purchase an unlimited meal plan? lived on campus for two years and definitely did not have an unlimited meal plan. I always had the 10 meals per week plan and it worked perfectly for me and was much cheaper than the unlimited.,Come on all you libtards.. raise hell... this a public school university.. how dare you dictate where someone can live attending a public tax supported school.,Not a fan of this. The year I lived in the dorm was the worst year I had at MSU. Seems like a blatant money grab.,It's not a money grab. It's to boost retention and graduation rates::: especially for underserved minorities. Welcome to the era of data analytics. Their IR department crunched the numbers and found that students who live in the dorms longer are more likely to graduate. All colleges are under constant pressure to improve graduation rates. If their data show that grad rates are 2.5% higher for students who live in the dorms for an extra year::: and that for URM students that number is more like 10%::: they'd be ignoring their responsibility if they didn't try it. Remember::: MSU tuition is heavily subsidized by taxpayers::: who don't want to subsidize dropouts. It's only a good investment if people graduate.,So we can keep the Mens and Women’s swimming programs now? Because those generates $1.2M for the university,Yikes! If you cut tuition in half I agree with this decision. Otherwise::: this is not a good recruitment strategy MSU.,It’s cheaper for many students to live off- campus.,How about veterans and married couples going to school?larry,Money grabbing jerks...driving up student costs,I think it’s a good idea! Been there did that!,Money problems MSU? Hope you don’t triple up kids in those tiny rooms like in the 80’s.  BTW maybe fix those dorms up a bit.,Why would the school not post a public poll on if this should or should not happen? Look at these comments. About 99% of them are against this. :/ schools/ businesses/ etc need to listen to their customers... if they want to continue having them,Does this mean the dorms will actually be open in fall of 2021?,Terrible decision that may impact my high school senior’s college choice.,Absolutely disgusting. What is wrong with this school?,Meanwhile my school all but kicked you off campus by second year 😅,They have to make up for all the kids not coming back because they are going to refuse a flu shot...,Layoff some admins and cut their salaries and benefits and not squeeze the students for more government dole...,What other Michigan colleges/ universities require this?,I would’ve transferred if this was a requirement when I first came to MSU..... what a joke,Translation: MSU creates rule to suck more money out of students,Money grab by my School?,Don’t pretend it’s not about the $$ MSU. That’s insulting.,A disappointing robbery.,Translation: money-grab,Msu continues to disappoint. Sincerely::: an alumnus,That is really disappointing.,You are just going to keep destroying choices for this poor class!,I agree. I had a great time in the dorms,University trying to make money because they lost a lot sad times,Glad I graduated. MSU just all about the money,Ridiculous. So disappointed to be a part of the MSU community as of lately.,Bad idea and disappointing as an alumnus,Aka- give us all your money 🙄 i loved living on campus but it's unaffordable,As an Alumni::: I agree with this. It allows for students to experience the campus without added stressors.  Your first two years are in preparation to be accepted to your major. The goal is graduation.  We must remember you have more years to be on your own than not. Why the rush? Yes::: I know it may seem cheaper::: but in the long run it is not.  There is the commute to campus::: added expenses otherwise taken care of on campus::: easy access to classes. There are times on campus you don’t feel like commuting to class::: but at least you are already there. Don’t forget the cost of gas::: if you have a car and/or longer commute on the transit.  I understand money::: we all do::: but so is off campus. Who doesn’t want meals already prepared. Times when you are not feeling the greatest you have cafe to go within dorms. Go to your room with furniture you did not have to purchase.  I do understand for some it may be easier but you have the stressors to work harder when you should be focused on graduation. What about the roommate who decides to not pitch in::: you have to work harder on your off campus job to keep bills going::: tired and say skip commuting fall behind in classes and many times drop out.  They are not taking away the opportunity solely giving it as an option once you become more responsible and have gotten where you need to be academically.  No rush to push yourself out in the world until absolutely necessary. This here young lady stayed all 4 years and in my opinion met many people I otherwise would not have and enjoyed learning more about the campus. I was not isolated and had easy access to amenities I would otherwise not have.,Nice money grab MSU. Whoever's running my alma mater is giving us a bad name...,What’s the point of this if they are told to stay in their dorms::: not socialize::: have a life::: or have fun::: no person classes::: or have a real campus experience? What a joke! Thank God my son chose to live off campus. For the amount of tuition my son is paying out of his pocket there should be face to face classes. He advised he is not learning squat from MSU with this ridiculous online learning!!,truly disappointing::: MSU.,I would have hated this!,This is a transparent and disgusting cash grab.,Wow - that's regressive.,Wow::: really messed up. Reconsider immediately.,The good old days.,Sing the new MSU anthem: https:// www.youtube.com/ watch?v=JkhX5W7J oWI,Stupid::: bad money grabbing rule.,Dorm food = horrible food. Bummer,It's a money thing.,Just another ploy for more money. What a rip off.,What a money grab. That’s ridiculous.,What is this a boarding school?,Yikes::: I hated dorm life. Lame money grab by my alma mater,WTF MSU?,Notice no one ever suggests that the U tighten their belt. God forbid the profs take a cut in pay. The Director of Public Safety makes FAR more than the Detroit Chief of Police. Tuition rates have skyrocketed over the last 20 years- WHY? The public is suckered in to paying more and more while students graduate deep in debt. Something has to give and soaking students for a forced 2nd year on campus is wrong. I hope the message they get back from students and parents will make them reconsider.,This was a grilled cheese in case hall. No way would I pay for two years of this food,Michael Kriss,Lower your tuition prices would be a great help. State Universities were never intended to be so overpriced for a family with medium income. The name State should stand for affordability for everyone. Charging so much for online classes is ridiculous.,"Think this through folks...short term sacrifice for a long term gain. I challenge you to do the financial math and prove it is really cheaper to live off campus when you have to sign a 12 month lease at very high rent::: and buy all your groceries and not waste any of it. So the residence halls are small::: and out of date. It used to be a right of passage to go away and live in a ""dormitory""...n ow it's looked upon as a huge inconvenience. Maybe if people didn't need to be so instantly gratified and think they should have whatever they want without sacrifice or hard work::: this would make more sense. The MSU Residence Hall system is top notch::: engaging::: and you'll meet your best friends for life here. Embrace the fact you have a roommate. Embrace the fact you have to share a bathroom and possibly clean it. Embrace for a couple years before you become a real adult you don't have to cook for yourself! Life is short and this campus experience is a once in a lifetime thing. But again::: I challenge anyone to show me it's cheaper to live off campus because rent is high::: and those apartments are low quality buildings also ripping off college students.",Sounds like a money squeeze to me,Alyssa Martone Hubbard for TWO years in a row? I’d die,Martin Hella,$ grab,Baljit Randhawa,Andrew Manuel,Margaret Escobar,Interesting 🤔,Gross money grab,Gabby Griffin,Money grab,Emily Hund,Rebecca Rariden I can’t say if my GPA went up that 2nd year😋,Money grab $$$,Just more drinking rapes and drugs.,Steven Hoffman Anne Hoffman,Sucksssssssss,Emily,Jaclyn Elise,Nice,What a scam.

MSU's gold-rated sustainability efforts include generating power for campus with the help of the largest solar carport array in North America. http://go.msu.edu/Qjp,2020-11-30 16:00:02,"It gives ""Go Green"" new meaning. :)",How many gallons of petroleum and oil were used to produce and distribute these solar panels and where were they made? Did that offset the use of fossil fuels?,Years ago::: Cincinnati zoo had a parking area with solar panels. Haven't been there in a long time but I am guessing they expanded. It helps keep the cars a little cooler as they are parked in shade. It might help with snow removal from windshields.,💚💚💚💚💚💚😊💚,How much money did you waste on this gold rated project? What is the payback? How much did this cause tuition to go up? How well will they work in Dec::: Jan::: Feb and Mar?,I have heard that this array supplies 25% of energy for MSU,Do you get enough sunshine to warrant this endeavor? Probably not. Arizona maybe. East Lansing::: I don’t think so.,Yup! It’s true. Every open parking lot on campus is covered with solar panels. Someone asked what it cost::: I don’t know but I bet they’ll pay for them selfs in a few years! MSU is being proactive and environmentally conscious.,Better than turbines killing “ exotic “ birds. Is that eagles and loons? NO thanks...,How much did it cost and how long til it pays for itself?,WHO shoveled off the SNOW ???,Go green. Go Green!,"after 2 yrs::: it is looking like my payback will be about 12yrs. Try looking at these as an ""investment""-an alternative to stocks and bonds. Mine return me just under 9% in electric bill savings. (tax free which would be about 12% taxable investment). As electric prices rise::: my return rises. Also::: when you pay $100 electric bill::: you have to make about $130 (so your electric bill is REALLY 30% higher than it says it is!)/. A great financial product as no one out there can name me a 9% tax free investment. S&P 500 stocks (blue chip) have returned a little over 10%/yr taxable in like 100yrs! Mine=no risk::: Stocks= plenty risks.",It's beautiful! Add some windmills!,Alex Ritter

The simulations were done on the Mystic computer. This was a vacuum tube computer that was built by the electrical engineers. This machine looks to be much larger!! Stanly Lee Steinberg.

MSU is home to the top-ranked School of Packaging::: whose graduates account for more than half of all packaging professionals employed in the U.S. http://go.msu.edu/WYp,2020-11-18 14:15:21,Launched my career as a packaging grad. Great decision.,We are proud to be the home of MSU School Of Packaging!,Always proud to work with the MSU packaging grads.,Thanks for the shout out! MSU PKG 2004 grad,So many great packaging ideas 🥰,"Please...all you who are in packaging. STOP using huge amounts of packaging material to cover much smaller objects. And the heavy plastic that can not be cut without extreme effort has got to go!! In fact::: lets get rid of plastic packaging all together. I love the new biodegradable ""peanuts"" that can be washed away. Now that is genius!!",I’m an MSU grad (not packaging) and have been thinking about my former classmates. I wish I knew how many of them are now reversing course::: applying all their might and talent to the horrific mountain of plastic and waste packaging they and the industry created. Not blaming them directly; I guess it was the times. And I hope sincerely that the school at MSU is focusing strongly on eliminating single use plastic and packaging waste. Personally::: I’ve eliminated plastic in shampoo::: soap::: laundry detergent::: dishwasher detergent and more. Whatever havoc was wrecked by the school and the students in my day needs an abrupt and serious about face. Anything less is unethical.,The best decision of my life was the day I changed my major to Packaging Engineering. It helped launch a 30 year career at #Beiersdorf😀,And a fine one at that.

MSU has prepared her well! #spartanswill,Please work on making packaging easier to open for those with disabilities or just plain hands that can’t grasp. I struggle mightily with the packaging on many::: many things. Inaccessible packaging::: from milk jug caps to batteries::: from salad to cheese::: from soap to cleaning products::: from medicine to tools::: often renders the items inside useless to the consumer. WE CAN’T OPEN THEM!,Hopefully working on materials that don't require fossil fuel extraction::: and break down when their job is finished.,Erin Topper::: I keep seeing this post and thinking it's an add for one of those subscription services like Bespoke or Stitch fix::: but with Spartan swag. Someone that knows something about packaging should do that. I'd be down for that subscription. (If you and Topper make it happen::: I'm calling dibs on about 3% equity),Linking costly college educations to jobs/careers should be a mandate! Well done Packaging!,Did an MSU grad come up with LOL dolls::: because that was genius. I’m paying 15$ for a doll worth 3::: because the kids live opening these crazy things.

I usually swear at the idiots who tamper with/take items so made it necessary for this group to find ways to stop the loss! Thanks a whole bunch!,Every time I have a problem opening a package::: I give credit ( and a small curse) to the packaging grads from MSU.,Yeah! They are talking about you Shelby Rindelaub! ❤️⭐️❤️⭐️❤️⭐️❤️,That’s fantastic! So well deserved! I had several great packaging majors on the Swimming & Diving teams. Sadly those programs are being cut despite generating net revenue for the university because of tuition paid by walkons and the highest team GPA for the university.

Shall I mail it to you? Thank you for your leadership! Naples::: Fl. and Mi.,Like her choice of school::: not her politics.,So thrilled for James Madison/MSU! GO GREEN!,Not good for her reputation or resume!,Don't quit your day job lisa!,MSU expects their students to already have those skills like basic Math so things like an electoral college situation in which one candidate has 306 votes and the other has 232 really means the person with 306 wins the day there’s no alternative facts at a great college like MSU alternative facts are for losers with 6 th grade educations,Makes me ashamed to be a Spartan,Absolutely great one of my fellow Spartans on yet he Biden team!,President elect? Are you aware of the actual election process? You might check with your law school.,Proud to be a Spartan! Congratulations,Don't quit your day job!!,Way to go Dr. Cook!,Woohoo! This is spectacular; congratulations !,MSU- you’re an institution of higher learning. Apparently you have much to learn. Joe Biden is not the President elect. Educate yourself about Amendment 12.,Larry Nassar in charge of Child Services too😂😂😂😂😂😂 #pedo #sniffer,Too bad there isn’t a President-elect Biden,Amazing news! Congrats to Lisa!,Michigan State has now proven that it is not only a leftist indoctrination camp but also a diploma mill.,Well::: she won’t be working too long::: because Trump is still gonna be president for the next four years.,He wont need a transition team because he will not be installed as President,Go Green! For all those saying ‘too soon’::: where is President Trump? He was adamant at saying he was elected for 4 years and not less when pushing to confirm a Supreme Court justice. All that we’ve seen since Election Day is President Trump tweeting::: taking revenge on Secretary of Defense::: a pathetic press conference::: and golfing. IF President Trump can prove the fraud he has been claiming for several months::: then do it but stop this social media garbage. Regardless::: we need our president NOW! Stop the imitation of a petulant child and BE the POTUS.,Congratulations to Lisa Cook! Go Green,I'll accept who the winner of the election is when the electors convene and make it official. The media does not make the call and has no business telling anyone who the president-elect is. Did Biden win? Probably. But I'll wait until it's official.,Keep university a free space of political aspects. Be prudent. Thanks.,Congratulations to Lisa Cook and MSU!! President-Elect Biden is pulling together a great team::: and finally::: there is a better direction ahead! 💙💚,Fantastic!!

I'm so grateful I was placed in Campbell Hall and had the privilege to walk thru it 100s of times. 💚,Be still my little green and white heart! So beautiful.,And here I was worried that the campus wouldn’t be as beautiful as Cornell in the Fall... ha!,There is no place in the world more beautiful than MSU in the fall!

Sparty on!,It brings so many good memories! The beautiful campus and my years as a student there.,Its a cool morning here in Malaysia,I preferred walking on the earth::: beaten paths. I realize sidewalks are more practical.

Loved my time there. A spartan through and through! 💚💚,The photo would be great as a jigsaw puzzle. I’d buy it.,I like the approach of not putting down permanent paths until the foot traffic revealed the most likely routes.  I've been so many places in my life where some daft architect puts down pave which takes everyone out of their way and inevitably volunteer paths are established in the turf.

Kim had flown over there with him and after spending a couple of days she went on to Spain. Tony had taken a nap before a meeting and woke up late and rushed to the meeting. Everyone started to give their condolences and at first he had no idea what had happened. Kim had not heard about it either for a while. It took forever to reach them and I was very worried. Tony offered to come home::: but we told him to stay::: all flights had been grounded anyway. It took a while for Kim to get home and ended up having to fly into Canada first.

We were required to take 6 terms of Physical Ed. back in the 50's. because it was a Land Grant School. I thought they were great classes::: and used them through out my long life. I was a girl from the small town of Menominee::: going far away from home for the first time! It took about 9 to 10 hours to drive there::: as we had to take the car ferry across the Straits. If you missed the ferry::: you had to wait for it to return to make the trip again. The Bridge was completed in 1956.,Go Green 💚,So proud to have my BA and MA from MSU!! Go Green!,Best investment in myself I’ve ever made.,From MSU,If you have not been to campus lately::: you should. It’s a sad shell of the glory. Students are nowhere to be found or very sad if they are. Buildings shuttered. MSU is hiding from the virus::: not using their own plan::: and fading away. Other universities and college towns are safely blooming and welcoming. Sunday’s Detroit News says it all. Heartbreaking and can’t sustain itself living in fear for long.,Business Degree 1970.,Best for who?  85% of college students receive financial aid::: ie::: other people’s money.,Katie Steeves Herrick Steeves,Go green,I graduated almost 50 years ago and have used my MSU education every day of my career!,John Foster,Proud Spartan Alumnae!!,I would invest in face to face not virtual 🤷‍♀️,I got a great education at MSU!,"While I did pay my way on my own through MSU::: it was a one the great gifts of my life. It has clearly faced some of the best and worst of challenges the New MIllennium can throw at all colleges and universities. But::: scaling peaks and valleys against nearly 600:::000 living alumni::: 51:::000 students and ongoing acknowledgments of excellence -\-\ with a notable minimum of the arrogance ""challenge"" so wildly peddled as if worth hearing elsewhere -\-\ I'm a great fan of my alma mater's future.::: not to mention its breathtaking beauty. At the end of the day::: I've not known another campus-related culture with so many smart::: kind::: and reasonable people who so love the place that transformed their lives.",Right on green and white!,🤩,I have never been sorry to have attended MSU.,I graduated 50 years and have never once regretted my time at MSU. Best years of my life.,when I attended MSU it was required to have ROTC and PE to graduate. That was due to the originate Land Grant Charter Plus Agriculture. School looked good on paper. BUT- Majority of undergrad classes were taught by Grad students and the big push was to attract Foreign students since they paid the big bucks in tuition. Could have stayed in Grand Rapids and attended Junior College for less money and same classes.,I'd make that investment over::: and over::: and over again!,Too often college is looked at transactionaly. The world is full of great careers that may have nothing to do with your area of studies...but you will have shown yourself to be worthy of the investment that comes with employment. Education doesn't stop at graduation.,Proud Spartan!💚 ‘73,Joe lay off the dope. $60:::000 first job starting I believe is darn good. All universities have pay salaries::: electricity::: food for students that doesn't cost what the student pays::: maintenance::: classroom equipment::: feed for livestock::: transportation::: athletics::: and the list goes on. Students choose their own courses that they want to pursue. Not everyone wants to be a doctor::: lawyer::: engineer::: biochemist etc. Michigan state does an excellent job in teaching students and yes it's expensive just life life.,I was in a bad place when I was dropped off in East Lansing in 1972. My dad left my mom::: she had to sell ‘my home’ and bought something smaller for her and my brother and sister. No room for me. Did she think I wouldn’t come home for summers or vacations? I also had on a full leg cast after having bone tumor surgery. Knowing I might lose my leg if the surgery didn’t work. I had no money at all. Couldn’t work dragging that leg around with crutches for 5 months. My tuition was paid in the divorce settlement::: but I had to beg for book money and any extras I could get. My dad married someone nearly my age one week after the divorce went through and spent 3 weeks in Hawaii. How nice. I turned 18 in November and boy did I learn to drink. I always went to class and by mid-sophomore year I truly became a Spartan. If you apply yourself you can do anything.,Be sure to take Bait and Switch 101.,Economic and health balance seems to be forgotten. Talk is cheap from the MSU president. You plan for a full COVID dorm yet close campus. You say cases are from large gatherings yet allow out of state and international students off campus because tuition is higher.,Wages have not increased in who knows how many years::: Tuition has more than doubled::: if not more::: in that same amount of time.,Joe Wandyez MSU is not alone in this. Nearly every college does this. Private and for profit schools are even worse.,"Only: ""30% earning $60:::000 or more in their first job"" ? That's crazy low given the extreme cost of a four year degree::: close to $80:::000. This means that nearly 70% of students are trapped in jobs that do not pay particularly well::: and will have difficulty paying back their student loans. How can MSU be so irresponsible as to put students in significant debt without giving them the skills to land a job that will let them comfortable pay back that debt? MSU either needs to direct students to fields that pay enough to pay back their student loans or needs to reduce the cost of education to something that is affordable to pay off.",Your education is what you put into it. The people that don’t find is “useful”::: probably valued going to Harpers every night rather than studying... then being upset when they get a D.,Why did you stay? Unfortunately you took the spot of another student who wanted to take advantage of the academics.,The most valuable thing MSU could do would be to significantly increase quality and access::: while reducing the cost. Online learning allows MSU to hit all of the objectives above. Basic classes can be fully online and largely self taught as students move at their own pace. Students can explore as many fields as they like at low cost without the pressure to commit to a major. When students have completed their basic classes for a field thus demonstrating their capabilities and interest they could then apply for a major on campus for the more hands on class work. I remember as a student that many of the Khan Academy lectures and other YouTube videos were superior ways to learn rather than going to class for many introductory courses. MSU needs to adapt to the times or risk becoming increasingly obsolete. Two years of basic classes at MSU on campus was about $40:::000::: Online learning (or for that matter the same classes at a community college) can be done at a fraction of the cost saving students from a significant debt burden. It's MSUs responsibility::: its mission to reach as many students as possible without leaving them in significant debt.,But not football.,After being here for almost 4 years I find that hard to believe.,They finally realized it!,Regardless of the field of study::: the value of education has fallen dramatically with online learning. Sadly::: the cost has not. Collaboration::: coordination::: cooperation and interaction are essential::: valuable skills that students are being denied. For online learning::: there are dozens of universities that do it better for far less. Parents and students continue to pay for a full load of product even though MSU only delivers a partial load.,Go green ❤️❤️❤️,Go Green!!,I attended when it became a university and also beat UOFM and we were allowed to stay out after midnight to celebrate.,Spartans Will!!

Happy first day of classes to all our Spartans! 📷: @allanahcunha,2020-09-02 20:53:30,I agree with you. I don’t believe hiding in a bubble will help our immune systems. It is just political. I bet in November the COVID numbers will decrease significantly::: particularly if The Democrats are in office.,"Start planning for a Class of '24 online graduation folks because if the current approach to this virus remains::: nothing will change. If most folks were to be honest with themselves::: they would admit that they have been socializing with their friends without masks for quite awhile now. I would imagine nearly everyone has been to at least one graduation party or gathering this summer...it is part of living life. If so::: then to be an alarmist about the lack of mask wearing in public is hypocritical at best. Our kids have been socializing among themselves without masks even more than the adults since this began. Where they do this (on campus or in their own neighborhoods) doesn't truly matter. Unless these kids have been kept away from their vulnerable family members the whole time thus far::: there is no difference now. I would imagine if the kids had been tested throughout the summer before going to college::: similar ""spikes"" would have been found. I also find it interesting how the narrative has shifted from keeping this under control for the sake of the hospital capacity (which has been accomplished for the most part...yes there may be exceptions). Now it is all about the case count even though hospitalization s and deaths are rock bottom in most places. Pinning your hopes on a vaccine being the ""end all"" is shaky at best::: as there have been several issues identified with protection duration::: viral mutation frequency::: etc. Perhaps an eventual ""herd immunity"" might eventually be the end game::: but for some reason this is hard for many to accept. Thus::: the only logical conclusion that I can make is that MSU is covering their a$$ from potential liability. I will not be surprised to see many other schools eventually shut down due to similar hysteria::: but this does change my opening statement. Keeping the kids at home isn't going to change much. Peace.",As an alumni I support administration 💯!!,Don’t get it -,Spartans will.,First day of what? Sitting alone in your apartment? Wow.....wow.... .welcome to overpriced propaganda.,Should we point out the obvious that if Americans could have put away their “they can’t take my rights away::: I’m not wearing a mask!!” BS::: then we would have toned this down months ago and kids WOULD be on campus?? Or are we not going to talk about that??,And just like that she is a Sophomore #downriver,Yeah Adam!,Treasure these years. They'll go so fast. Go Spartans Students💚🤍💚🤍💚,Go green Go white....  to class. to labs. to get the education you not only paid for but deserve.,I support the decision. I believe MSU made the correct decision for students::: employees::: and the public.,You want to blame the Alumni when the university doesn't represent any conservative approaches. Like the country the Alumni are divided and the country comes first before loyalty to the university,Lynn David Cox,Thanks for staying safe::: Spartans!!!!!,As an alumni and as a parent I doubt if MSU found this solution was too complicated for them to make. Their decision was based on Science trying to keep all students involved and not just the Senior class::: SAFE!,And what about those classes that started today with ZERO communication from the Professor? Unacceptable. They will certainly hold the student accountable but can’t hold themselves accountable. Very disappointing!,Go Green 💚💚💚,Happy 1st day! Go Green 💚,💚💚💚 Study hard and be safe!,Have a great year Spartans! Go Green!!,This is what day 1 as a Spartan looked like in our house.,Anxiously waiting to join MSU,Is this a joke???,This isn’t rocket science::: people. Wear a mask::: don’t congregate::: maintain social distancing::: use your brain. Having just dropped off my daughter to her apartment where she is living ALONE and understands how to keep herself safe::: I am very disheartened to have witnessed all of the people walking around East Lansing::: unmasked. Ignorance comes in all shades of green.,I'm disappointed as a mom whose son graduated in May 2020 that no plans have been made to honor the 2020 class.,GVSU has more than 100 positive cases. Even though I have a disappointed MSU student::: I think they made the right choice.,Sit 6 ft. Apart and wear masks. However::: remote learning is safest!,Maybe your senior will live. Isn't that what your focus should be::: mom?,As an MSU employee who was updated daily I can tell you there were many complicated plans that faculty and staff were willing to implement. MSU employees spent hundreds of hours working on this::: even when they were not being paid for the summer. How would you be talking about MSU if YOUR senior died from COVID? I can tell you::: from personal experience::: no matter what decision administration makes it will be “disappointing” in the eyes of Alumni. This experience has made me “sad and disappointed” in the lack of support from alumni.,Happy to see your smiling face @allanahcunha!,I appreciate the fact that Michigan State is being very careful and scientific in their response. I trust MSU yo do what is best for the students and not the university pocketbook 💚🤍,So disheartening in-person classes are indefinitely suspended.,Gogreen andgowhite,Enjoy every minute of it you can.,Spartans willNOT.  Gone is the fight for the only colors::: green and white::: back is the weak.  What is your profession?,They are showing concern and are smart.,And a lot of those schools are having a huge spike. Some students are being expelled for breaking rules.,As an alumni and a parent of a senior at MSU::: I find it very sad and disappointing that the university has no plan in place to attempt to bring students back to campus. Many other universities have come up with innovative solutions and didn’t take the “its too hard or complicated” route and have students on campus.,SpartansWill💚,Michigan State sucks Go Blue

Never again will support them...,Go Green Go White. Go Far::: Far Away COVID 19,I'm all for recycling but not PPE. 👎🏻,Don’t living organisms like covid 19 virus dry out to a non perilous effect over time? If you leave your contaminated mask in sun light does this destroy the 19 virus? Can a used mask be microwaved to destroy 19? How does washing make a used mask safe?,Did you have something to do with this Genna?,Unfortunately we have squandered the time gain by flattening the curve by not ramping up production of PPE. My mask is used for multiple 12 hour shifts. It is decontaminated by UV-c. When suspected to be contaminated. Ie after intubation first a COVID patient. Go Green (2000),I appreciate all the feedback on this press release! As the point person on this project::: I hope to provide some details here: We are authorized at MSU to only return masks back to their original wearers and every mask must pass a fit test by that individual before it is deemed acceptable for reuse. Further the FDA is only permitting up to 3 decontamination s per mask::: as long as it continues to pass its fit test on the actual health care provider. MSU is here to provide support and an option for extending life of PPE only if there are no other options available this fall::: it’s an opt-in partnership. FDA reviewers analyzed our data for over 3 months before approving the process::: similar to many other sites that have similar VHP decontamination programs. This was based on scientific method and validation of pathogen eradication. We appreciate all of our partners at Sparrow and Henry Ford that assisted us in the studies::: and the Governor::: AG and Congresswoman Slotkin for raising awareness of Michigan’s needs in DC. Take care!!,I trust MSU for this science.,Can do it by vaporizing hydroperoxide in the microwave::: then putting the mask in there.,Spartans Will!!,Spartan Strong!!!

Trying to spin this as msu being “heroic” fir donating all these PPE which was going to go to students/staff.,Spartans Will......Go Green!!,That's my MSU! Go Green!,Thanks you for sharing::: continue being safe::: continue being blessed.,Thank You. 💚💚💚🤍🤍🤍,It’s really easy to donate all your PPE when you don’t need it at the university due to the fact that there is still nothing going on in person. MSU acting like online classes will do just fine. In reality the quality of education online is trash. MSU shouldn’t act like they’re being so courageous donating all this PPE. They should be attempting to have students back in person and keep the PPE for students and faculty on campus.,What a waste
Effective immediately::: we are asking undergraduate students who planned to live in our residence halls this fall to stay home and continue their education with MSU remotely.  PRESIDENT.MSU.EDU Aug. 18: Fall semester plans change | Office of the President,2020-08-18 21:25:56,Will we get refunded for room and board? I emailed account receivable and it’s showing “error sent”.,Good decision💚,As a parent::: thank you for keeping our students safe.,I wonder what the school will be doing for those who need the resources that campus living provides in order to continue with school. You can’t assume all students will have access to a strong internet connection back home and will be able to thrive in a virtual learning environment rather than in person. There are even some students who rely on campus living because it’s the only place they feel safe. Some people really need the resources living on campus provides. I hope they allow students to drop their classes if needed without any fees or hassle.,Proud MSU alumnus here.,When will we receive refunds on housing/meal plans?,President Stanley::: please clarify ... “asking” or “demanding”?,Thank you for taking these safety measures for your community! Spartan Strong & Smart!,Dr. Stanley::: are you “asking” or “telling” my Freshman son that he can’t move into the dorm ? “Ask” is a request not a directive. Please clarify.,Difficult but smart decision.,Stay safe::: Spartans and Go Green!,Did you register your student for the fall? If no::: stop posting. If yes::: of course we are disappointed with a one week to move-in complete pivot by MSU administration. We were one of the first universities stating in early summer that we could make this work - now we are the first Big-10 to withdraw campus living with only one week b4 move in. Spartans Will Not. As a Spartan myself::: I am angry. Our kids deserved better planning and notification. And the numbers of COVID in our region do not warrant this knee jerk reaction.,So sad to hear this::: but appreciate MSU making responsible decisions for safety. Best of luck::: Spartans!,Well done President Stanley. GO Green.... It's a pandemic! Students should be at home.,Go Green. Keep everyone healthy.,The school president is an epidemiologist::: he’s in tune with what is safe vs. unsafe right now. I trust his judgment.💚,Thank you for posting this,Thank you!! We walked around campus on Saturday morning and out of all of the people out and about we saw walking around::: only 3 wore masks (despite the signage everywhere asking that you wear a mask both inside and out) 😷,And::: you’ll no doubt::: refund their housing fees::: right?,OMG::: y'all didn't see this coming?!!!! We were preparing for a move in on the 31st. But we knew this was likely. Even my new msu freshman was not surprised. Nor did he have a fit. So many need to take a lesson from the class of 2020. They have handled disappointment with grace. Again and again. They are 18.,Everyone take a deep breath. This is our reality right now. Every one of us has had disappointments with this pandemic - weddings cancelled::: loved ones having to die alone with no service to memorialize them - the list goes on. Life isn’t fair right now so let’s try to make the best of it and be grateful for what we do have.,This is SO last minute! Why couldn't you have come up with this plan BEFORE we spent a small fortune on dorm room essentials and got excited about the move. Totally disrespectful to the students and families this affects.,Smart Decision! Go Green!!,Thank you for choosing to prioritize the safety of your students❤️,"""home"" is not safe for some students even in college. Sad about this. I understand::: but it is sad. My Freshman year roommate is still one of my best friends 45 years later.",Although sad for students::: I admire MSU for courage to make this decision which will obviously be unpopular with many. After what happened at UNC it is probably the right thing to do. Proud once again to be an MSU alumnus.,asking or demanding?,It's the responsible thing to do. 💚,As an alumni::: this is a terrible decision to rob these students and parents. What a joke you've become! And after the limiting of parties of 25 by Linda Vail today what is the point in even coming to town? So disappointed!!!,Terrible decision by MSU. Heartbreaking for the students. And they waited to close housing until after all the $$ was already due for fall semester.,Thank you for being smart about this!,The wording is ambiguous - if you are “asking” undergrad students planning to live in residence halls to stay home::: does that mean students still have a choice? It does not firmly state that dorms are closed to incoming undergrads who don’t fit exceptions. The “asking” phrase::: to me::: implies a choice.,smart call::: I appreciate this decision 💚🤍🤗,Wow. A lot of parents are willing to send their kids into dangerous territory just so they can take in-person classes. Instead of berating MSU for trying to keep your kids safe::: be grateful they have a way to continue their education while avoiding a life-threatenin g illness.,"Are you ""asking"" or ""telling""? I can't read the official letter::: the website is down (likely due to the stir that this post and the email you sent just created). Please clarify.",So I’m wondering if the tuition will be discounted too since the education is NOT the same!! 😡. If mine were a freshman or sophomore I would be switching to community college to save money if it’s online anyways!!,I know this sucks::: but as a student I would rather find out 1 week before than finding out 1 week in. I’m sure MSU will reimburse everyone for housing contracts that have already been paid. Everyone I know that has chosen to learn remotely has already received the reimbursements.,Most of the people I see hating on this aren't even students 🤣,You really let down my kid. And honestly I think this was planned all along. I think you were worried to lose students because they would just transfer to cheaper local colleges. You should have made this decision long ago. We bought all kinds of stuff for the dorm room and my daughter was really excited. Very sad right now.,This is ridiculous. Especially for incoming freshmen who already had a horrible year and for graduating seniors. Many other schools already have students at their schools. My son at Ann Arbor still has school. This is a stupid decision.,THANK YOU! My daughter was going and we have been extremely worried about it. I can now sleep knowing that she will be safe at home.,Wow::: this is absolutely ridiculous. Bummed to be a Spartan alum right now. Glad I don’t have a student going to MSU.,Nice that you announce this right after we’ve paid tuition. Tuition costs should reflect remote instruction. Not all students learn well remotely so if they are not getting a full in person education some monies should be refunded. This is BS,Thank you for making the right decision 💚,Per usual::: acting out of fear instead of science. Disappointing. My heart breaks for students.,Spartans will...be safe. This is such a hard decision::: but ultimately it's the right one to make.,Great choice for the health of all those involved. I applaud you MSU!,What a mess. Nothing like changing the entire plan a week before students come back. Not to mention this decision being based on nothing. You can’t tell me it’s not safe or feasible before you even give it a chance. Let those worried::: stay home and learn remotely.,If they are asking does that mean they can still go live in the dorms?,This is the right choice.,Fortunately and unfortunately::: this is the right choice. There’s no telling how many idiots will sue the University for catching Covid at a party or anywhere else. Go Green.,Nice time of day to post this. Wait until all of the offices are closed for the day so no one can call and get any additional information. Surprised you didn't do it at 5:00 on a Friday.,Students cannot get money back for leases off campus. This timing is awful and not considerate at all. MSU looks like they just wanted their money.,Seriously everyone..... google what the career is of our current awesome president of MSU. He knows what he is doing and he isn't being malicious. I would love to thank him for this decision!,Proud of MSU for going virtual but not for charging students for tuition and THEN announcing that it will be remote learning. Freshman and sophomores could have taken community college courses since they won’t even be on campus anyways.,Good for you::: MSU. Should've announced this a few weeks ago though.,Nice of them to wait until tuition was paid before announcing,Good decision.  Unfortunately college means a lot of parties. Not a lot of discipline with most undergrads. And dorms are such close quarters.,So out of 18000 kids at North Chapel which I’m assuming that is what this is based on 134 kids got sick that is like nothing at all and 5 staff. Seriously that’s nothing stop panicking goodness .. this is very bad timing. Mine is still going she’s off campus but even if she wasn’t i would still send her. We can’t move past if we keep hiding at home. Sorry this is ridiculous.,Michigan State University Why are we even having classes? I'm in my senior year::: I've signed a lease for an apartment I won't even be staying at due to the nature of everything going on. How are you going to mitigate damages?,I love STATE with every inch of my soul. The timing is awful. I hope you lose students in the future.,Very disgusted with MSU I have two kids out of state and the lack of assistance from professors during spring semester was awful,Great decision by President Stanley. Hopefully::: that action help protect the general public and East Lansing community and residents. The athletic department needs to keep an watchful eye out for all of the football players who remain on campus and in the community.,Good decision. Notre Dame and Duke both just today had to shift to remote learning after starting live classes and having big spikes in new cases.,I remember when I used to be proud to be a Spartan.,You have had 6 months to come up with a plan. I am so disappointed that this is the best that you can do for these students!,It’s still amazing to me that people get so upset about people and institutions trying to keep THEIR kids safe...,This is terrible!!! The poor freshman were beyond excited!,Think this is the right decision but hard for those students who signed leases at apartments that they can’t get out of.,I hate to see MSU closing down. What a waste! Look at the data::: not the fear::: and rethink this for next semester.,I imagine students will just be remote all school year then. Doesn't make much sense to move in January and out in May. I know I wouldn't want to do that. Honestly just ready for 2020 to be over::: and 2021 as well since you know this crap is going to carry over into next year as well. It is what it is...……….,What about those students who have signed contracts for off campus apartments?😖,Horrible decision and the timing completely inappropriate. I am not proud of MSU leadership.,I hope they get their money back and a discount on classes.,Absolutely ridiculous. Do people really believe that infectious diseases didn't exist before COVID? How many students caught flu last year? Pneumonia? Menigitis? What is the basis for this absurd decision?,Hey MSU::: proud 2019 alumnus here! Not saying you didn’t make the right decision::: but let’s talk about how you guys closed campus and switched to remote learning not even a week after all your students paid their tuition and room/board. You’ve had 6 months to figure this out? And are so conveniently closing now after everyone has signed their leases and paid their dues? #Spartanswill scam their incoming students 🐸☕️,I paid my tuition on time::: in good faith that my daughter would receive a quality education with some opportunities for in person instruction as promised when she registered for classes. You are not living up to your end of the bargain. I wonder what would happen if I tried what you are doing with my daughters apartment complex...oh wait I’m legally on the hook and you should be too. Maybe you need to tap into that 3 billion dollar endowment and start issuing some refunds. Shame on you::: if you were going to do this it should have happened before tuition was due.,This is so disappointing. Families were already given a choice to keep their students home if that’s what they wanted. What has changed for this decision to be made? I am so frustrated for these kids.,So are they going to help us get out of the lease on my sons off campus apartment he signed a lease for Oct 2019?,While this is obviously the best option for the health of the community::: I have to wonder why they waited to announce this until right before move-in. I can see why people are frustrated.,Not a good decision based on the the facts and science of this virus::: and certainly not at this late date. What if these students wanted to attend a school where real in person education was being conducted?? No chance at this late date! Not a proud Spartans Will moment...,Sad they just announce this a week out of kids going back!! You know the covid stats. Poor planning and leadership!!,This decision needed to be made WAY sooner. There are SO MANY students who have purchased items for their new dorm rooms already::: made travel plans::: etc. Also convenient that this decision was made right around the time when tuition was had already been paid by many students 😡 If you were going to close you should have done it SOONER!!!,A good epidemiologist does not necessarily make a good leader of a university...St anley’s leadership reeks of disorganized cowardice with no real plan or strategy. His intentions may be pure::: but it does not make his actions correct. I wish the best for the students and the university despite this horrible decision.,Might as well take classes at a cheaper online college. Shouldn't pay tuition for a full university when your staying at home sitting at computer.,This is a good decision for everyone's health but a lot of negative consequences come with this. I am paying out of state tuition for online classes and you're encouraging me to stay home. I already signed an off-campus housing contract that I can't get out of and so have many other students. My biochem lab and advanced organic chem lab are online????? Cause that's going to give me the skills I need for grad school. If we decide to skip this semester will we lose our scholarships and financial aid? will there be more classes offered in the summer such as in person lab classes? You can't just send a message like this and leave so many unanswered questions.,This virus isn’t going away. Time to let the students go to school. Protect your older professors but move forward for your students sake. Assuming they won’t test positive or get the virus is unrealistic. They will. Stop ruining their lives.,Might as well withdraw from MSU::: go to community college for a year::: maybe two::: transfer back to MSU as a Junior. Save some money. No one cares where you started::: only where you graduate. Seriously.,Disappointing::: the least MSU could do was let these young adults try to show that Spartans Will... lead instead of follow.,Funny how tuition cleared 3 business days before this announcement. Wonder what would have happened it was done 4 days ago. Oh...there are people enroute or moved in already. This new MSU President is a HUGE joke. What a jerk.,I get we need to keep our students safe but::: Mr President::: kids who’ve signed apartment leases can’t get out of them! They’re not only paying regular tuition for an online education but::: they’re paying rent for an apartment they don’t really need! I’m disappointed things weren’t thought out differently. Decisions weren’t made with all student situations in mind.,It's all a bait and switch with the colleges - their revenue has plummeted - so tell everyone there will be in class learning to get them on the hook and then flip it all to remote. They knew all along it was going to be remote.,As a resident of East Lansing and someone who enjoys the excitement of the students returning::: I am breathing a sigh of relief.,I’m a US Air Force veteran who moved from Virginia to Michigan to go to school at MSU. I signed a lease so that I could be here physically. The quality of education will now be the same as that offered at my local community college. How do you justify this? Why am I being deprived of the quality education I sought? Why are people who are scared of COVID personally::: making decisions for *people who are not*? In a country of more than 330 million people::: we’ve had about 170:::000 people die. That works out to about .051% of the US population — about 120:::000 deaths being older folks who’re 65+ — not kids under 25. Why are you waiting until now to make this decision::: when I don’t have time to enroll at a cheaper school?,These kids had other schools they could’ve attended in person but now that is too late. MSU has robbed them of that with this last minute call. This is unacceptable.,We are supposed to move in our freshman in 11 days!!! Why couldn’t you decide this a month ago??,"Given what's happened at other universities that are shutting down mere days into the semester::: this is absolutely the right decision. Better to make the decision now::: rather than let students move into dorms (the university doesn't control off campus housing)::: let clusters grow and then send them home potentially exposed. And it gives faculty a bit of time to rework their classes.  I've been in EL all summer (since I'm an older grad student::: I don't ""go home"") and even though it's been pretty quiet::: I still see young people gathering or having parties whenever I'm out. I've been dreading the return of the undergrads and the increase in cases that would inevitably accompany having more students in town so this eases my stress level a bit.",Huh. Maybe telling your staff BEFORE releasing the information to the media would have been a better way to go. You just trampled on loyal staff that are probably going to be tossed in their back sides because you can't keep their jobs with no students to support them. Not saying this is a bad decision::: just that you should have notified your staff first. Finding out through the news is crappy.,A big part of the college experience is not academic. MSU forgets this. Why would any freshman enroll in MSU or any other university? Take cheaper credits at a community college then transfer when these universities figure out how much their decisions are costing them.,I am glad they did this now::: as a resident of North Carolina::: and seeing the logistics nightmare of figuring out what to do as parents/ students and how to get home::: or not... glad even if TOUGH::: HARD::: last minute decision::: MSU made the right call. With 50k UNDERgrad students::: that’s more than a city and even with good intentions::: keeping people out of each other’s dorm rooms? This is a pandemic::: but you are losing college experience and policing like that... won’t happen peacefully. 💚💚💚💚 LOVE YOU MSU!,Thank you MSU for putting our kids health and safety first! It also helps parents and students plan more for the fall semester. Thank you!,It was the right decision::: however hard to make. Science wins at Michigan State!,This is so sad for all the incoming freshman::: as all of the other schools in Michigan are going forward with residential living on campus. These kids are now watching all of their friends move into their dorms at other schools and there is no way out at this point. MSU has been promising all year there would be an on-site option::: had them pay their tuition this week::: and basically makes it completely impossible for them to go to another school at this point unless they transfer to a community college. Thanks MSU for making my daugher REGRET being a spartan when she had a ton of other options.,This is what happens when institutions like MSU are run by the left,Waiting until the week after tuition was due to announce what *surely* was a decision made long ago... I can't believe such a prestigious university pulled a scam this dirty. If they can't have the campus experience those students are better off taking online courses from Community Colleges and you knew it.,How do you do a lab remotely just saying ... good bye science degrees which we need they are usually the ones that go into healthcare which we need more healthcare workers right now,Don't kid yourselves::: this is about protecting cowardly university faculty not the students. Very sad point along with all the other negative issues they have faced in recent history::: it will just add to a difficult image recovery,Sucks::: my out of state daughter is there living off campus::: but still had to pay out of state tuition. And we cannot get out of a lease to come home,Are off campus leases that students can’t break going to be covered? Asking for a friend NOT! It’s my Student and this is BS!,Nothing like a last minute switch a roo. The University should’ve been more forthcoming to the students. I am sure off campus students can not get out of their Apartments contracts 9 days before the semester. They will give students a refund or credit for student housing. Good luck with getting a refund. You’ll be more than likely forced to taken a credit. Hopefully students can take electives at a community college. Paying a high tuition for Virtual Classes is not worth the money.,As a parent a couple students we would all really like to thank the University for screwing us after signing lease agreements with off campus housing::: knowing crowded dorms wouldn't be the safest choice::: and waiting until the very last second to make this announcement.,Well this should be a University wide decision for all students who were supposed to be living on campus not just the students that live in dorms. What about all the sorority and fraternity houses on campus. So all those people still get to live in the greek houses but the freshman moving into dorms cannot. That doesn't seem right!!,Best to keep everyone safe during this historic once-in-a-lifet ime crisis. It’s sad but it’s for the best right now. It’s not worth even one life to re-open in the midst of a burgeoning pandemic.,People:  Yesterday: having classes in-person is just a money grab.  Those same people:  Today: cancelling classes is not fair to students.,Hmmm::: this decision was not made until after the tuition payment was due on Friday. Coincidence? I don’t think so.  I think many students::: including mine::: may have deferred their admission a term if a decision would have been made last week.  Signed::: a proud MSU alumnus.,Will the university help students break their leases since they no longer need to be near campus and are being encouraged to stay home?,"MSU::: Thanks for the ""Parents' Office Hour"" last week telling us about all the safety precautions in place for students to live on-campus.",Seems like you could have told us this before deposits were due but you just wanted to keep enrollment up. thanks.,So does this also mean all of the athletics students will also need to return home which means football::: basketball or any sports will not be allowed to practice or train.,Thank you for the Lansing::: East Lansing community and health care workers.,It's a virus. It will never go away. Generally speaking::: for all the shutdowns::: government EOs etc::: what is the end game? What needs to happen for colleges or other places to re-open? In this case::: under what circumstances::: MSU::: will you say students can return to campus? Just wondering.,Thank you for the safety of our students and also that of our communities that are near MSU.😊,Will any refunds or grants be issued to off campus students who have already signed leases? It’s frustrating to find out after signing a lease that I cannot get out of that there is no reason for me to have it any more. And I paid full tuition. Will another Corona Cares Grant come out? Discounted tuition? Housing aid? A little late in the game to announce such a significant change and not help the students::: especially off campus students who are locked into a useless lease now.,What do the students do about getting their books that are needed for their classes. A lot of students had them reserved already at a local store. Sure the local students can still get theirs but what about the non locals?,You should allow students to cancel spring housing contracts::: so students can get apartments if they need. great job being SOOOO last minute. this is the dumbest decision ever.,So MSU is not releasing students from their on campus housing in spring 21? If your kid decides another school or community college is a better solution::: they keep the money. So big of you MSU,They didnt even give the students a chance to be tested. Just took their money and then slammed the door.,Are they serious? The Say in this post… We encourage all students living around the campus as well to stay home? Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha WHAT???? Oh I’m sorry you mean the thousands of kids who already signed leases and apartments? This is Just ridiculous,"Gutless decision. It's all about the fear of being sued or bad press. Very little to do with the 'welfare of students"". It all about optics.",I feel for those incoming freshman. Was one of the best experiences of my life at MSU.,I find the timing suspicious!!! Tuition::: room and board due August 13. The governor making her speech from lancing aug 17. School shuts down August 18!!!!!!,I am a bit frustrated with the communications on this. Far Too late. My son would have chosen another school had we known this in July because nothing has changed since July. Nothing at all. All online classes::: only one of them even with a zoom-in class makes this a huge waste of money but it was too late to make other arrangements. Academing counselor is not at all impressive either. All classes should at least have live online sessions. And what about Spring semester? Would like to make alternative plans by October and not have to wait until January.,Removed the students option to choose another university that was proceeding safely by making the call so late. Not a proud Alum right now...,Thanks for putting safety first. I know it’s a tough call.,ND & ACC already have reports of COVID and have changed plans. Good choice MSU.,I literally just finished shopping for my daughters dorm today...and I come home to this 😭.,I read about it last night. I agree with the courage and the pride!  I feel bad for all who will have their jobs affected.,For everyone upset::: get a refund and send your kids elsewhere for the semester. You can still get a refund on classes. Just let it go. Life will move on.  “For changes made through the first ¼ of the term of instruction (measured in weekdays::: not class days)::: 100 percent of the semester course fees and tuition for the net credits dropped will be refunded.”,I support this decision::: look at Norte Dame just the me example!,You guys pulled the ultimate bait and switch. You knew you were never opening but got us all to send our tuition payments. This is not fair to our kids,What about music students that can distance in class. What a panicky joke MSU has become. So sad.,Better get on making those refunds happen as quickly as you made this decision. People need that money to secure apartments now 😡,All the students should just take a sabbatical this year. Get jobs and save money. I already moved my Senior who is a R.A. into her dorm last Saturday. Still waiting to see if she gets sent home.,They can take a gap year and work. It’s less they will have to borrow for the following year,At least they had the foresight of watching and taking in to consideration what happened at other universities when they tried to open and made a command decision to not repeat the same bad result!! 👍🏼👍🏼,Shows nothing of leadership just capitulation to mob rule and not based upon facts.,Since everyone is so up in arms about this::: here's a brief background regarding President Stanley: Graduated from College of the University of Chicago with honors in Biological Sciences in 1976 Stanley received his Harvard Medical School MD specializing in Internal Medicine in 1980. Appointed as an Associate member of the American College of Physicians.  He knows how to handle this effectively and should be trusted in his expertise. Yes::: He voted to cancel sports for the purpose of keeping everyone safe. Better safe than sorry.,Absolutely ridiculous!!!!! If masks protect everyone from the flu what’s the freaking problem?!,We were there walking Saturday as well. Very few people on campus..... only one young man without mask. All others respectfully wore them.,May schools are being sued because they are not receiving the education they paid for,They are doing what’s best to keep the students and staff safe.,Better be giving them students their money back then. They paid for in person learning not online learning which you learn little to nothing doing. I hope students file more lawsuits like they did last time at multiple colleges after they forced them online after they paid for in person learning.,You know the first thing these kids are going to do when they get to campus is party before classes even start. They won’t need bars to do it and there won’t be any social distancing either.,My daughter made the decision today... she is out. She will not be a spartan::: instead will go to her first choice!!! Good luck everyone,Some Universities:::an d now MSU::: are shutting down::: going to all on line classes::: telling students to move out of dorms and go home::: etc. If attending a University is about learning and intellectual thought than those in charge and shutting down are just the opposite. No one with Any intelligence expected the virus to be “gone” when schools opened but certainly wise and careful thought would have plans in place for social distance opportunities and other protocols to give those that want a choice::: to attend classes::: live on campus::: and participate in activities::: to do so. These Universities are showing that they do not represent what they claim to be::: certainly do not represent the best and the brightest but rather the scared and the defeated.,You all have been suckered. They knew all along there would be no in class education. They waited until you paid your tuition and before you moved in. This is happening with other things. Trying buying tickets to an event and then have them cancel and keep the money.,MSU (and all other universities) should reduce tuition. But we will pay it so they won’t.,Simply wished this announcement had come sooner. It's the responsible course of action::: but the release of the decision is brutal.,How horrible to do this 10 days before move in ...,Ok. So people are getting sick. Most with no symptoms. Hospitalization s DOWN a minimum! Mortalities still lower than flu! How is the world does this make sense. BECAUSE IT DOESN'T. So when the flu hits we gonna shut everything down for flu?! Colds?! That is how ridiculous this is.  BTW...my daughter locked into an apartment. Am I getting reimbursed for that. NOPE!,my granddaugher attended 2015 - 2019 and I remember the excitement/ energy of move in day 😢 And that beautiful fall campus,They opened colleges in Georgia and there were huge outbreaks. Has to be this way for the foreseeable future,That age group feels invincible::: thus the risky behaviors. This time they need to stay home.,Yet another money grab! Hold off on the announcement until tuition was due and paid. Off campus leases signed. Pathetic!,You knew this was coming and waited until payments were due. Total BS,10 days before we’re supposed to move in? Such vigorous planning.,Tough decision but the right decision.,It’s amazing that every university and college in Michigan is opening to students::: but not MSU Is this political?,What about students who have to do a work-study to pay for their tuition?,How do you justify taking my money for tuition and then cancelling all in-person classes?,Asking and requiring are two different things. If they still want to come to campus::: can they?,What about the students who are registered for classes and living off campus and have recently signed leases!!,CMU is allowing the students to choose online or classroom. Cmu started yesterday.,"Are you charging the out of state students in-state tuition since may is not providing housing effectively making all students "" in state""?",Is there any support from the school for kids that need to terminate their recently signed leases ?,Thats crazy. After parking passes paid and 1 week before move in. Way to drop the ball MSU. Not sure how regular High schools are opening and your closing.,With all due respect::: if you were planning on campus not shutting down at all...that’s kinda on yourself. With everything going on::: you should be prepared to have your student not physically attend. I’m a current senior this year & yes I’m upset I can’t go on campus but guess what? I understand why. I honesty never expected to get through the whole semester on campus. They were bound to send us all home at one point. Rather it happen now than after everyone moves in. The timing isn’t good yeah::: but life throws things at you ALL the time. Yes::: they should have said something sooner but they didn’t. Rather you want to believe it or not::: COVID is real. I’m not saying EVERYONE will get it. But I am saying I care more for professors who are older and staff members more than me having a fun time on campus. Us students may not be “at risk”. But a lot of people we interact with are. Reality is::: college students party a LOT. Not all of them::: but a lot do. It’s a smart decision imo to have everyone who can stay home::: stay home. Trust me::: I didn’t want to stay home AT ALL. I understand everyone’s situation is different and that’s complicated. I’m very upset my the first semester won’t be on campus and all of the money issues is very very frustrating but::: once again::: I understand why. It sucks yes::: but it’s been done. No matter what choice they made::: someone was gonna be upset either way. Rather be safe than sorry. I hope all of you understand why in the future as well. Best of luck to everyone and hopefully we will be on campus Spring semester! I’d love to graduate on campus. Stay safe everyone. ❤️,Absolutely ridiculous look at the numbers for 25 and under age group. We can’t hide until the virus goes away::: it doesn’t work that way.,As a college student this is is frustrating. Many classes have online version offerings::: if people aren’t comfortable in the classroom::: that’s fine::: they can take the courses online.  This is similar::: not perfectly comparable::: to closing down grocery stores. The “safer” option to have your groceries shipped to you (take online classes) is made available::: but the store remains open (in seat classes) for those who are willing to take the calculated risk to take courses face to face.  This is a serious disadvantage to those who struggle with virtual learning. Also::: waiting this late into the game to swap their gameplan is unfair to the students. Had they known in advance::: they could’ve gone through a CC to take pre-requisite courses at a cheaper rate::: but MSU::: along with other universities who will follow suit I’m sure::: led on/will lead on with false promises and students locked in to their university for high tuition rates have no choice but to pay outrageous dollars per credit hour.

No large gathering partying It also comes down to bars doing their part enforcing masks and social distancing and keeping control over their clientele. It will be interesting to see how Norte Dame’s ban on all partying works out when they re- open. After the incident at Harper’s I believe MSU made a wise decision. Young incoming and returning students have not demonstrated a willingness to take this virus seriously and cooperate,Completely disappointed in this decision. MSU has done a tremendous amount of preparation for the return of their students. 11:::000 of the typical 15:::000 were planning to come on campus::: knowing that the virus still existed and also understanding the necessary precautions needed to stay safe. The world must go on in tandem with the virus. MSU was just featured on NBC for their proactive precautions as a leader in the collegiate realm. My heart breaks for our kids! I am furious that they waited until 10 days before move in. Pivot....??? This is more like running scared!,https:// www.nbcnews.com/ news/us-news/ 8-days-semester- notre-dame-halt s-person-classe s-146-students- n1237195,This is a joke... Just traveled to Michigan from California to provide ample 14-day quarantine period as requested for our freshman son. For months there has been plenty of communication by MSU how this school year would work effectively with students on campus::: living in dorms::: online classes fall semester only. We would have made other decisions or plans if we knew this nonsense. Nothing has changed to make this decision now vs three months ago.....other than they have our tuition $ now. This is extremely marginal. Previous MSU presidents were not this weak.,Take a GAP year. $7:::262 per semester tuition and fees at MSU. $1:::555 tuition and fees at Oakland Community College. If you are just going to be staring at a computer there are much less expensive options.,"Disgusting. He caved just like all the other cowards out there. Where is the discount for online classes? The loss of campus resources? What about the off campus students who paid upwards of $700 per month for empty apartments from March through now? The students off campus who were bullied by landlords to re sign leases for Fall back in Spring? Funny how parents on their students apartment accounts were sent emails throughout the year::: but when the pandemic hit::: we received only a few emails and then it stopped. Our student(s) continued to receive lengthy emails outlining their monetary obligations to their leases.Where is MSU in all this? They are negligent in response to any of these items::: as if the parents are an endless money pit.  It is well known throughout the nation that we have one of the most hated governors in the country. At almost two hundred::: continuous Executive Orders::: she is crippling and bankrupting this state. She is NOT doing it for safety and that ship has sailed. This so called ""pandemic"" has fallen from the beginning. The expected case increases is due to the spread::: not deaths. In a state of almost 10 million::: the death toll sits at approximately 6900::: lower than any given year of various viruses and other illnesses. Do the math and you'll find this a complete and utter joke. In fact::: our great governor is responsible for a third of the deaths in nursing homes.  The Democrats are feverishly working to keep us locked down. The word ""chaos"" was in fact mentioned several times during their lackluster DNC broadcast. They are the party perpetuating the chaos::: not our President::: who has pushed for reopening since May. Businesses aren't reopening and going bankrupt. Few professionals have returned to their jobs. Government shut down. Services failing and politicians crying ""loss of revenue. We need money. Beg from the Feds or hit up the taxpayers."" Have you noticed the increase in prices of goods and services as they scramble to make up for their losses? Anyone challenging this governor faces court and gets their license suspended. She is pure evil.

Just a reminder that people having the right to differing opinions is really what makes our country so great. Those of you that berate another person because theirs differs from yours are as much a “virus” as COVID. It’s like an adult version of romper room. Do you also encourage your kids to be bullies?

"Another great Q&A with an Eagle involved in the Olympic Games!

Boston College Alumni
August 6 at 10:27 AM ·

As the Olympic Games wind down::: viewers have seen the iconic Olympics logo tied to many other noteworthy brands. But who makes these connections happen? Behind the scenes at the United States Olympics & Paralympic Games Committee (USOPC)::: Boston College alum Dave Mingey ’92::: senior vice president::: partnership management & activation::: is in charge of stewarding the partnerships between corporations and Team USA. We caught up with him to talk about his role.

Q: Were you an athlete growing up?
A: I played a lot of sports growing up but focused on rowing for nine years::: getting my start on my high school rowing team where we won two national championships. At Boston College::: I was co-captain of the men’s rowing team::: and then I rowed competitively for one year after graduation. My wife::: Darby ’98::: was on the track team at BC and was a talented runner.

Q: Summer or Winter Games?
A: Summer. With more than 200 nations and territories in attendance there is a more global feel with the Summer Games. Winter Games are about one-third the total scale of the Summer Games.

Q: Favorite Boston College Athletics tradition or memory?
A: Definitely Marathon Monday. I mean::: how many campuses have one of the world’s biggest sporting events running through it? But in terms of a specific memory::: I will never forget storming the field after David Gordon’s kick in 1993 that gave the Eagles a 41-39 win over Notre Dame in South Bend.

Q: How would you explain what you do with USOPC to elementary school students on Career Day?
A: Unlike almost all other National Olympic Committees::: Team USA doesn’t receive any federal funding. Our athletes greatly depend on our two biggest sources of revenue: donations and corporate support. I oversee the team responsible for our key sponsorships and the marketing campaigns of numerous global and national brands such as Coca-Cola::: Nike::: and Airbnb.

Q: Has your job taken you to any interesting places?
A: I’ve worked on 14 Olympic Games and have attended 10. My first was Lillehammer in 1994.

Q: Fun fact about you?
A: In 2002::: I had the opportunity to run as a Torchbearer for the Salt Lake 2002 Olympic Winter Games. I ran my leg of the route in Brooklyn::: N.Y. I remember standing in my assigned spot::: waiting for the torch to arrive when an Olympic official on a motorcycle rushed over to me to yell above the noise of the helicopters overhead::: “Remember::: once you begin running::: you will be the only person in the world responsible for getting this thing to the Opening Ceremony.” It was surreal.

We caught up with Boston College alum Dana Jozefczyk ’06::: associate general counsel of intellectual property for the United States Olympics & Paralympic Games Committee (USOPC)::: who handles intellectual property rights::: copyrights::: and trademarks for the world’s biggest games.

Q: Can I put the Olympic rings on this post?
A: The short answer is no. The USOPC is a nonprofit and we rely on sponsors to provide resources to send Team USA to the Games. BC isn’t an official sponsor or licensee::: so we ask that you not use the rings and other marks.

Q: Summer or Winter Olympics?
A: I really love them all! My senior year::: I remember sitting on the Mods couches for hours with my friends::: watching every single televised snowboarding event during the 2006 winter games in Turin::: Italy.

Q: Favorite Boston College Athletics tradition?
A: During my junior year::: 6-7 of us rented an RV and drove to a campground outside South Bend::: Ind.::: for the BC-ND game. We drove out there in one day. I remember playing a lot of cards on that little RV table.

Q: Has your job taken you to any interesting places?
A: I’ve toured the training center at Lake Placid. My dad played hockey growing up and we are all hockey fans::: so it was a big deal to see where the Miracle on Ice took place.

Q: Fun fact about you?
A: I’m famous among my friends and colleagues for mixing up idiomatic expressions. I say things like “horse and pony show” and “the egg doesn’t fall far from the tree.”

Q: What’s a typical day at the office?
A: With the Games coming up::: we’re getting a lot of reports of people infringing intellectual property. We know how excited people are about the Olympic Games. I do a lot of education on how to switch up their designs and usage.

Q: So::: can I put the Olympic rings on this post?

Better to be forgotten than tormented?,Let parents attend. Please reconsider.,"Thought I would share my most recent email to Jack Dunn and BC Leadership. To date::: I have not received a single reply to any of my communications.
The silence is deafening.

Dear Mr. Dunn:::

I was thrilled to learn::: from Jennifer Eagan::: that Boston College has submitted a plan to the City of Boston to allow for the 25% capacity in Alumni Stadium with the intent of allowing up to 2 guests per graduate. This news has been shared and is being well received.

Given the approximately 4500 attendees between undergraduate and graduate students::: it would lead me to believe that BC is considering holding two sessions thereby allowing each graduate the opportunity to have at least 2 guests in attendance.

This is the solution I and the almost 3200 hundred supporters of my petition believe is the correct outcome based on the relaxing of the capacity and the three weeks available to make the necessary changes. Allowing only one guest may seem like a compromise but in all honesty it will put additional stress on the student having to choose which parent should attend. I am sure you agree that these students have had enough stress and strain this year and we should not burden them with more.

While I recognize Northeastern University is only allowing one guest::: their graduation is this weekend and prior to the May 10th change. However::: I will mention that they are holding separate ceremonies for their graduate and undergraduate students to allow for guests.

Mr. Dunn::: I appreciate that Boston College is taking the necessary steps to do what is right for these students and parents. These past 15 months have been less than ideal for all of us and these seniors have truly missed out on so many wonderful opportunities afforded to prior BC students. To celebrate with their families is a way to bring joy back to what has been a less than joyous year.

While my emails have focused on the Alumni Stadium capacity situation::: I would be remiss if I did not mention the individual college diploma ceremonies. It is my understanding that past Commencements started in Alumni with speakers::: then the students go to their respective colleges for the formal handing out of the diplomas.

If past practice is to be followed this year then then the updated guidelines do not have a capacity restriction for events held under a tent as long as social distancing is followed and the tent is open at least 50%. This is wonderful news for parents to attend the individual diploma ceremonies and to share in the joy of seeing their child walk across the stage and be handed their hard earned Boston College diplomas.

Mr. Dunn::: I look forward to learning more about the changes being made to Commencement to allow parents and their children to celebrate together. And::: I am confident that the BC leadership team will do what is right.

Sincerely:::

Christine Swanson",Still trying to figure out how a 45:::000 seat football stadium won't safely sit approximately 10:::000 people.,BC::: you disappoint me. David Brooks?,LET PARENTS ATTEND!!!!!,"No more excuses BC! Guests can be allowed.
Here is my letter to leadership that has yet to receive a reply.
Subject: Change in stadium capacity allows for in person attendance

Dear Father Leahy::: Dr. Quigley::: Commencement Committee Members and Deans:::

As you are aware::: Governor Baker and the City of Boston have relaxed their stadium capacity requirements to allow for 25% attendance effective May 10th::: 2021. With this news::: our petition has gathered in strength with almost 2600 signatures to date. This is just over a 25% increase since my first email to you on Friday. I invite you to read the comments provided by parents and students requesting a change to allow for in person attendance. http://chng.it/
8bZ99XNY

Given capacity limitation was the reason BC gave for not allowing in person attendance::: the relaxation of this restriction has been received with great enthusiasm and provides Boston College the flexibility of changing their very restrictive Commencement plans to allow for parents and guests to attend.

I recognize that some roadblocks may still exist and I would like to provide some thoughts around overcoming these roadblocks and doing what is right for the students and parents.

Time crunch-with just under a month until Commencement how can you effectively plan?
Solution: I am confident there are multiple large event coordinators in Boston that would welcome the opportunity to assist BC with this undertaking.
Parents and students recognize that time is short and we understand that the planning may not be perfect but to be allowed to share in this joyous event with our children is more important than a perfectly executed plan.

Still do not have capacity with 4500 students and honored guests scheduled:
With a stadium that seats 44:::000::: 25% capacity is 11:::000.
You can hold two sessions-Underg
rads in the morning and Graduates in the afternoon.
This will allow 2 guests per student and allow for social distancing.
It will allow time between sessions to do the necessary cleaning.
Reduce the number of honored guests and facility scheduled to attend.
Isn’t it more important to have the parents and guests in attendance?
It will demonstrate BC’s commitment to their students and parents!

Short time for notification to parents:
This is not an issue as most parents are planning on being on campus to move their children out on the 24th.
Remote learners still have time to make travel plans and get vaccinated::: if they have not already done so.

On behalf of the almost 2600 parents and students who have signed the petition::: I ask that Boston College do what is right for the students and parents. There are no excuses left not to.

Sincerely:::

Christine Swanson",We are flying to Boston for graduation.

"In a letter to the BC Community::: University President William P. Leahy::: S.J.::: has announced that Commencement will take place on May 24 in Alumni Stadium.

Because of COVID-19 health and capacity regulations::: attendance::: unfortunately::: will be limited to graduates::: senior administrators::: honorary degree recipients::: and other select members of the community. All Commencement events will be livestreamed.

READ: http://on.bc.edu/BCCommencement21",2021-04-13 16:16:09,"All of us recognize the disappointment among parents and loved ones over not being able to attend Commencement in-person. We had held our Commencement announcement in the hope of securing a different outcome::: but with COVID-19 cases continuing to rise in Boston and across the Commonwealth of Massachusetts::: the City of Boston issued its “Advisory Regarding In-Person Commencement and Graduation” on April 6::: which states: “Commencements or graduations held outdoors in venues with a capacity of greater than 5:::000 are limited to 12% of total capacity.” Given our staging needs and social distancing requirements::: Boston College can accommodate less than 5:::000 individuals in Alumni Stadium::: with 4:::500 of that total reserved for students eligible to receive their degrees. That limits the remaining capacity to senior administrators:::
deans::: honorary degree recipients::: faculty marshals::: and medical and security personnel.

Locally::: Harvard University and MIT have announced that they are hosting virtual Graduation ceremonies this year. Boston University is also hosting Commencement for graduates only. Northeastern University has proposed allowing one guest per graduate::: but it has not received City approval.

We ask you for your understanding as we prepare for Commencement on May 24::: and invite families to view the livestreamed ceremonies at: http://

The stadium is big enough to handle immediate family members and account for social distancing.,As an alumni and parent of a 2020 grad::: I am extremely disappointed in Boston College. 2020 had absolutely NO celebration!

My husband and I have been looking forward to this day for years as were other parents as well. We are both vaccinated and would have been happy to sit outdoors in masks. You could have limited attendance to parents at least. So you took the easy way out! Even northeastern is allowing one parent in and they have so many more students. Sending our child to BC has been a huge financial sacrifice for us as well. It would have been nice watching our 4.0 student who has worked SO hard walk across the stage in person.,Extremely disappointing especially since this is my only child.

Dear Father Leahy::: Dr. Quigley::: Commencement Committee Members and Deans:::

As you are aware::: Governor Baker and the City of Boston have relaxed their stadium capacity requirements to allow for 25% attendance effective May 10th::: 2021. With this news::: our petition has gathered in strength with almost 2600 signatures to date. This is just over a 25% increase since my first email to you on Friday. I invite you to read the comments provided by parents and students requesting a change to allow for in person attendance. http://chng.it/
8bZ99XNY

Given capacity limitation was the reason BC gave for not allowing in person attendance::: the relaxation of this restriction has been received with great enthusiasm and provides Boston College the flexibility of changing their very restrictive Commencement plans to allow for parents and guests to attend.

I recognize that some roadblocks may still exist and I would like to provide some thoughts around overcoming these roadblocks and doing what is right for the students and parents.

Time crunch-with just under a month until Commencement how can you effectively plan?
Solution: I am confident there are multiple large event coordinators in Boston that would welcome the opportunity to assist BC with this undertaking.
Parents and students recognize that time is short and we understand that the planning may not be perfect but to be allowed to share in this joyous event with our children is more important than a perfectly executed plan.

Still do not have capacity with 4500 students and honored guests scheduled:
With a stadium that seats 44:::000::: 25% capacity is 11:::000.
You can hold two sessions-Underg
rads in the morning and Graduates in the afternoon.
This will allow 2 guests per student and allow for social distancing.
It will allow time between sessions to do the necessary cleaning.
Reduce the number of honored guests and facility scheduled to attend.
Isn’t it more important to have the parents and guests in attendance?
It will demonstrate BC’s commitment to their students and parents!

Short time for notification to parents:
This is not an issue as most parents are planning on being on campus to move their children out on the 24th.
Remote learners still have time to make travel plans and get vaccinated::: if they have not already done so.

On behalf of the almost 2600 parents and students who have signed the petition::: I ask that Boston College do what is right for the students and parents. There are no excuses left not to.

Sincerely:::

Christine Swanson","Hi Laura! Can't believe Stephen is graduating this year! Congratulations
!! How can parents not have priority over the ""select members of the community"" ???? I don't blame you for feeling so disappointed!",Wow. Hard to believe a school like BC couldn’t find a solution. Sad sad sad,I won't go into how disappointed we are in the decision as others have expressed it for me. But::: other than the letter notifying me that parents cannot attend graduation::: I have received nothing about it. And::: I have gone to the commencement page which has very little detail. Specifically::: I would like to order graduation announcements for my family. I cannot find any in the school store. Can someone tell me where I can order these with the official BC crest? TIA,"Thought I would share my most recent email to Jack Dunn and BC Leadership. To date::: I have not received a single reply to any of my communications.
The silence is deafening.

Dear Mr. Dunn:::

I was thrilled to learn::: from Jennifer Eagan::: that Boston College has submitted a plan to the City of Boston to allow for the 25% capacity in Alumni Stadium with the intent of allowing up to 2 guests per graduate. This news has been shared and is being well received.

Given the approximately 4500 attendees between undergraduate and graduate students::: it would lead me to believe that BC is considering holding two sessions thereby allowing each graduate the opportunity to have at least 2 guests in attendance.

This is the solution I and the almost 3200 hundred supporters of my petition believe is the correct outcome based on the relaxing of the capacity and the three weeks available to make the necessary changes. Allowing only one guest may seem like a compromise but in all honesty it will put additional stress on the student having to choose which parent should attend. I am sure you agree that these students have had enough stress and strain this year and we should not burden them with more.

While I recognize Northeastern University is only allowing one guest::: their graduation is this weekend and prior to the May 10th change. However::: I will mention that they are holding separate ceremonies for their graduate and undergraduate students to allow for guests.

Mr. Dunn::: I appreciate that Boston College is taking the necessary steps to do what is right for these students and parents. These past 15 months have been less than ideal for all of us and these seniors have truly missed out on so many wonderful opportunities afforded to prior BC students. To celebrate with their families is a way to bring joy back to what has been a less than joyous year.

While my emails have focused on the Alumni Stadium capacity situation::: I would be remiss if I did not mention the individual college diploma ceremonies. It is my understanding that past Commencements started in Alumni with speakers::: then the students go to their respective colleges for the formal handing out of the diplomas.

If past practice is to be followed this year then then the updated guidelines do not have a capacity restriction for events held under a tent as long as social distancing is followed and the tent is open at least 50%. This is wonderful news for parents to attend the individual diploma ceremonies and to share in the joy of seeing their child walk across the stage and be handed their hard earned Boston College diplomas.

Mr. Dunn::: I look forward to learning more about the changes being made to Commencement to allow parents and their children to celebrate together. And::: I am confident that the BC leadership team will do what is right.

Sincerely:::

Christine Swanson",We need to flood the news station that did the story and ask them to revisit the report with BC asking them why they haven’t stepped up and made arrangements now that they have no excuse with the percent of people allowed at the stadium. I have called and I have emailed,As an alum & parent::: not only is it incredibly disappointing that I can't watch my daughter graduate in person but with the late notification of the decision::: I would have thought there would have been more conveyed about the depth of their efforts to try different configurations to make it happen and why it just couldn't. Once again::: Notre Dame beats us - they're allowing 2 guests. Yes it's Indiana::: but how about USC? They're doing multiple days. So many options & ideas just even on this post. Separate graduate school commencement from undergrad::: limit faculty to dept. heads::: do multiple days and/or multiple sections::: etc. I'm grateful there IS a graduation - my heart broke for the class of 2020. I remember my BC graduation like it was yesterday. I certainly hope cost was not a factor at all since no doubt this will have a long term fundraising impact...I join with so many on this post with my immense disappointment and sadness in how BC has handled this::: especially when I've been impressed with most of their efforts this past crazy year.,"Stanford just changed their plans and are now allowing 2 guests.

Thank you in advance for taking the time to read and consider my email below.

My name is Christine Swanson and I am a mother of a 2021 graduate. I am also the person who drafted and distributed the following petition: http://chng.it/
8bZ99XNY which has received over 2100 signatures from parents and students requesting a change to the current plans for Commencement. Please take a few moments to read all the wonderful comments and requests for change.

As of the writing of this email::: the BC Covid positivity rate .2%. To add::: many parents have been vaccinated in preparation for attending the graduation.

Since the notice about Commencement was sent to parents on April 13th::: I have done quite a bit of research on the guidelines set by the state on March 22::: 2021 and the City of Boston’s addendum on April 6th. Those guidelines are as follows:

Alumni Stadium does fall within the Boston city limits but a large portion of the campus does not. I have communicated with Mayor Fuller of Newton who indicated that these decisions were BC’s not the City of Newton. Based on my research::: I would like to propose some options:

The current Commencement population is 4500::: this includes approximately 2400 undergrad and 2000 grad students and honored attendees. I appreciate the desire to have all 4500 in attendance but the reality is that the grad students have been able to attend their undergrad ceremony with their guests and family in the past. The current undergrads have not.
Proposed very viable options:
i. Split the grad and undergrad ceremonies into two separate celebrations. One in the morning and one in the afternoon or across 2 days.

ii. OR-require students to register their guests and provide confirmation of a negative PCR or vaccination.

iii. OR-hold two events across 2 days

iv. OR-hold the ceremony just for the undergrads

v. OR-hold simultaneous ceremonies across campus for each of the colleges-Nursin
g::: Arts and Sciences::: Management::: etc. The speakers could be streamed to each of the locations from Alumni

Again::: not all of BC is within city limit so this can done.

We are raising the next generation who will shape the world. These individuals need to be problems solvers and solutions based thinkers. Wouldn’t it set a great example::: to these students::: for BC to do the same and create a solution to the issue surrounding guests not attending graduation. In other words::: doesn’t BC promote themselves as problem solvers? The hypocrisy is clear as day.

If Georgetown and Stanford can have a last minute change in plans and allow for guests::: why can’t BC? If Notre Dame::: UConn::: Northeastern::: UNH::: Emerson and others have figured out a way to allow guests to attend while maintaining COVID requirements::: why can’t BC?

These students have lost so much over the past year and half and to take away the celebratory time with their family is just wrong::: heartless::: cruel and will have long term ramifications not only to the students but to BC’s reputation and future financial endowments.

I also would like to share::: that there is a ground swell of legacy alums who have actively begun a movement to cease any and all contributions to Boston College due to their lack of thought and consideration to the class of 2021. These folks are also seeking to contact large private and commercial donors to do the same. This would be most unfortunate but as I say to my children “Actions have Consequences”.

On behalf of over 2100 individuals who have signed the petition requesting a change::: I ask that Boston College do the right thing for the students and parents and make this happen.","Now Georgtown has changed their plans. Come on BC you can do this for the kids!

Early results of a timely pandemic study by Boston College psychologist Joshua Hartshorne show that increased screen time by children is likely an indicator of family distress.  BC.EDU 'The babysitter of last resort',2021-01-27 13:54:02,The researcher states::: “I was surprised how closely the increased screen time results tracked school and daycare closures.” Really? Then he’s the only one. Every family I know is in distress::: and has been for almost a year now. Yes::: all our kids are on screens a lot. This does not seem like news.,I could not disagree more with this assessment. Increased screen time was forced upon our children as a result of the lack of in-person learning::: and as the primary means of communicating with friends whom they were forbidden to see in person.  This article is nothing more than an attempt to shame working parents who are not only focusing on working remotely while at the same time overseeing their children’s online learning. A child sitting in front of a computer for online learning for 6+ hours is not a direct result of the sudden decrease in adult “caretaker availability”. Rather it is a direct result of decisions made by our educators and policymakers to keep our children out of school and rely on online instruction.,Somebody paid for this study? How do I get that gig??,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Why stop Boeing make any sense,Great job guys,Class Act Well Done,I understand if the players collectively didn't want to play in a bowl game but if that's the case::: then the entire season should have been canceled. To decide now::: in what could be a big draw for potential recruits on the fence::: to opt out of a bowl game is baffling. The team just made it through virtually an entire season with only one positive test::: which is among the very best in the country in terms of safety protocols. A bowl game win also takes the sour taste of losing to a mediocre UVA team at the end of the season out of fans' mouths. With this decision::: momentum is certainly lost in showing progress with the football team. This needs to be an 8+ win football team next season. No excuses.

BC has a long standing policy way before it became PC!,This is absolutely fantastic! 👌🏽,I hope Boston College considers reading into the record at the forum some of the comments here. It would be my exhibit A in showing that we have a long way to go in making BC a welcoming campus for everyone.,“Forgive them Father::: for they know not what they do”,https:// fee.org/ articles/ is-black-lives-m atter-marxist-n o-and-yes/,Hey BC::: I'm pretty disappointed in your use of this photo. This event was planned separately from BC and on the parish grounds::: not university property. BC has a history of ignoring racism on campus. It's good that you're making initial steps toward rectifying those wrongs. But the use of this photo makes it look like this event was planned and backed by the university. That is simply untrue. This was an effort planned by the Jesuits in formation who simply attend BC. Some of those who planned this even wanted to make sure that credit was not taken by the university. This is a disingenuous gesture. I look forward to BC committing itself more fully to racial justice::: a process that is long overdue. But please reconsider the message you are sending::: when part of your message needs to be one of repentance::: reconciliation::: and reparation. -Class of 2020,Rachel Check comments,Please watch Social Dilemma on Netflix.,Looking forward to a system of actions toward racial justice on the heights.,I was proud of the Jesuits for putting on this protest::: but I don’t think the BC administration had anything to do with it and taking credit now seems disingenuous.,Astounding!,Embarrassing and irresponsible photo,Boston College I want to say thank you for what you’re posting on social media about what professors and students at BC are doing in light of today’s climate. However one believes his right to determine the actions right or wrong::: thank you for sharing with us not there. And for the record::: the antagonizing and hateful comments on your posts I’ve seen this last week are disgraceful and I’m not proud to be a fellow alumn with some of those authors. #MenandWomenforO thers,Proud Alum here! Thank you BC and fellow Eagles for fostering a thoughtful and structured way of tackling this issue. I got my first taste of social justice issues while at BC and have tried to do my part to make the world a better place since.,El racismo no debería existir Dios nos hizo seres humanos iguales,BLM is a Marxist organization. It is anti American. It is anti capitalist. It is WRONG.,Well::: you know::: after what Black Lives Matter did to St Patrick's Cathedral in New York City::: I'm sure the Jessies are out there to keep the same from happening to BC buildings. In case your Fake News Media didn't provide it::: BLM spray painted obscenities all over St. Patrick's Cathedral.,I wonder if BC would be equally as tolerant if a professor wanted to host a forum on Blue Lives Matter. Cops are being profiled and targeted with hate crimes every single day. Hmmmm 🤔,Black Lives Matter is a LONG way away from Martin Luther King's request that we judge a person not by the color of their skin. Instead by the content of their character!,People for others::: living the message of Christ...great job by these Jesuits. God bless.

The coronavirus shut down most aspects of normal life this past spring::: but efforts to promote and support formative education at Boston College persevered - and flourished - during online classes::: according to a BC research team's survey.  BC.EDU Formative education thriving at Boston College,2020-09-25 12:44:02,As an alumnae and Boston resident::: I am disappointed in the inadequate testing plan of BC. I can only imagine positive numbers would have been much lower had you done what other Boston higher ed institutions of your caliber and size are doing- testing of all on campus students every 3-4 days. Instead BC only did initial testing and then tested symptomatic students or those in contact with a positive case. Meanwhile::: down the road::: BU which has a smaller endowment and a student population more than twice the size of BC::: tests every 3-4 days and has fewer cases than BC. Now the governor has had to step in to assist with contact tracing at the expense of MA residents. BC dropped the ball on this::: and the communities of Newton::: Brookline and Boston are also being affected.,All BC students should boycott spending any money in the Newton community and see how fast the Mayor changes her tune.,Brett Gullickson how often are you being tested?,👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏🙏❤️,https:// dfw.cbslocal.com /2020/09/24/ cook-childrens-a larming-rise-su icide-patients/,Hi BC::: just wondering when you will be resuming on campus tours for potential first year students? Thank you!,My son is a senior attending BC::: he has been tested only once.,Hope I get to see my son::: and all seniors graduate in May?,Not a surprise,One important thing that didn’t happen in the spring was commencement. And then you quietly canceled rescheduled commencement. When will the class of 2020 graduate?,It’s devastating how many people have died this year from or with Covid::: but we are overlooking another group of casualties that could far exceed that number - our youth. In our effort to keep a viral illness from going viral::: we are playing Russian roulette with the mental health of a generation.  We need to protect those at-risk but we can't do so by hijacking the well-being of our kids without paying a far higher price.  We are counting test results to diagnose the health of BC students::: it's surrounding neighbors::: and that of our nation::: while failing to recognize or assess any other health issue - including ones they are far more likely to be impacted by.  Suicide is the second leading cause of death for kids ages 12-25::: yet there has been zero concern posted on this chain or from the school over what the ramifications are of keeping kids isolated::: in fear of having too much human contact - and disciplined if they do.  Suicide is expected to double this year. In my hometown we’ve had more kids kill themselves since May than we’ve lost state-wide to covid (for teens/kids).  Any parent of a child in college::: especially freshmen who don’t know people yet::: hears the distress in our kids’ voices. Countless friends have said the same thing about their own kids at schools across the country.  My daughter has been screened 4 times for Covid (no symptoms) since she arrived at BC. Where is the screening for mental health?  The rise in positive tests only underscore how high the survival rate is for Covid. As of this week::: according to the CDC::: the survival rates are 99.5% or higher for ages up 0 to 69. For ages 70 and up::: the survival rate is 94.6%. With this data::: we know who we need to protect::: and we don’t do so by putting our kids in danger of other health issues.  We keep asking our college kids and our youth to “do their part” but what are the at-risk groups (and the rest of us) doing to protect the them from depression::: anxiety::: suicide::: etc...?  I know my 80 year old parents don’t want their grandkids held hostage to assuage the fears of others.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A Q&A with Director of University Health Services Dr. Douglas Comeau and Professor of Biology and Department Chair Welkin Johnson provides answers to recent questions regarding Boston College’s COVID-19 testing program. | Read: http://on.bc.edu/QA091420,2020-09-14 21:44:19,I’m sorry but the testing protocols at BC are a joke.

A new Boston College Forum on Racial Justice in America and related initiatives are outlined in a letter to the BC community from University President William P. Leahy::: S.J.::: and senior administrators.  READ: https://on.bc.edu/Letter_June10,2020-06-10 20:08:39,So when the next black guy dies from a cop in a year::: will we start over again and do the same circle talk? because we keep calling it racism and injustice that is intentional?,Apologizing for letting police use restroom shows how spineless you are. It is a shame that you choose to do that. This country is based on law and order. You should be supporting them Shame on you,Proud of BC for stepping up and leading on this front,Same ole song ✊🏾,You don’t have to side with one or the other. It’s really strange that people are fighting showing anything police positive. You don’t have to hate or be against all police to take a stance against negative things. Grow up. If one surgeon kills someone do we do away with all medical personnel. Do we hate them all. Do we say let’s dismantle the healthcare system. I hope the police don’t support you the way you have done.,Words are nice. Action items are way better!,What reforms does BC support? Forums are alright but a stance would be good.,✊🏾👊🏾,Thank you Fr. Leahy::: et al. What I would like to see is what work are you doing individually and as faculty and staff to examine your own racist behaviors and beliefs::: both conscious and subconscious? During my time there 2003-2007::: my peers and I have experienced racism on an institutional level-\-\ a professor's bias affected my grade and the grade of a peer who was a black woman-\-\ as well as the usual personal exchanges that happen in the classroom and outside-\-\ too many to count and have to relive. Please do more and do better as a Christian institution.,"Curious what the ways ""advice and support"" will be sought for this and other initiatives? Perhaps a student seat on the Board of Trustees. Certainly a step in the right direction::: but I wish there was an acknowledgement of the students past and present whose activism made this statement and effort possible::: particularly the ones who have been punished in the past for protesting when BC refused to unequivocally say Black Lives Matter::: or anything for that matter during dozens of overt acts of racism on and off campus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Welcome to the Heights::: Patrick Kraft! #WeAreBC 🦅  BC.EDU Temple AD Patrick Kraft Named Director of Athletics At Boston College,2020-06-03 15:22:34,Three things he has to do - commitment to and execution of winning and having championship teams across the board::: enormous fundraising and facilities development::: and having the top academic outcomes for student-athlete s. I'm not stoked about this hire as some other choices may have been more suitable (particularly P5 players) but we'll see how things go. He has an opportunity to build on his solid record and truly elevate BC athletics to great heights. There needs to be a focus on having championship caliber teams::: the development of athletics facilities (basketball practice facility::: track and field::: new Conte Forum::: hockey facility::: etc.) and some of these could potentially be built on Pine Manor College land::: a continuation of huge injections of funding into the athletics programs and endowing positions and programs::: and going a step further with academic success and graduation rates to be #1 in the country.,Welcome to the Heights! It goes without saying that football and basketball need much improvement. If he runs a clean program and maintains a high academic standard (which I am sure the administration will)::: focuses on fundraising and actively engaging with the community::: and helps get football and basketball back into the top 25::: he should be fine.,Welcome to Boston College to you and your family!,Welcome aboard::: Pat. Best wishes for much continued success at the Heights! Go Eagles!!! 🦅🦅🦅,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Read Boston College President William P. Leahy::: S.J.'s letter to the BC community about the senseless death of George Floyd: https://on.bc.edu/Letter_June2,2020-06-02 16:16:45,"If you have been paying attention::: you do not wonder how it is possible ""in our day"" that yet another unarmed black person was killed in police custody. And::: really::: is all we can hope for is the ""possibility"" of life::: liberty::: and justice for all? Should we not::: reflecting on our racist history in America::: take this moment to insist that white America take its knee off of black America's neck::: once and for all?",I urge BC leadership to do more. What is the administration specifically doing to ensure the success (in the form of student satisfaction measures::: graduation rates::: dollars to POC student groups::: and other metrics) of students of color?  Acknowledgement is the first step. Action is the second.,Thankful,Step one would be take care of your own back yard (check out the pictures I posted below this comment for context),As a Minneapolis resident and a parent of a BC graduate::: this has been a difficult and horrific week for our community.,https:// bcheights.com/ 2017/10/18/ boston-college-h undreds-walkout -black-lives-pr otest-racism/,This statement is a lot of words and no action.,I have always found diversity matters at BC based on communications and forums. I am a parent to a student. Is that not the case Kathleen Flaherty ?,You can start by calling out racist behavior on the BC campus and attending forums with students,That’s not good enough. As an alumnus that was an embarrassing response.,The lengthy torture he experienced caught on video still replays in my head. It’s traumatic! This is heartfelt 😢,You waited a week and this is the best you came up with?,"As a current student at Boston College::: I am embarrassed to be a part of the Boston College Community. How can we::: as a University::: claim to be men and women of others if we refuse to genuinely be allies and advocate for the Black community? In Father Leahy's statement::: he asked ""how we at Boston College::: members of an academic and faith community::: can and should respond to the humane::: racist behavior so evident last week in Minneapolis."" Father Leahy's suggested responses were prayer::: the condemnation of the racial prejudice and profound injustice leading to the death of George Floyd::: and remaining people animated by faith::: hope::: and love. My interpretation of these responses did not include sending Boston College Police Officers to police the communities fighting for justice against brutality.  Time and time again::: the Boston College community has experienced racially-motiva ted hate crimes and systemic racism present within the Boston College higher administration. Time and time again::: the Boston College administrative response has failed to unite the Boston College community against racially-motiva ted hate crimes::: racism::: or discrimination. This SILENCE is compliance. This SILENCE further oppresses the Black Community at Boston College. This SILENCE is a part of the deeply ingrained::: systemic problem that further allows for racialist sentiment and oppression to continue on our campus. This SILENCE is not what ""men and women for others"" would do in the face of 400+ year of oppression and discrimination against Black Americans.",Died while in custody is very passive language. It was determined to be a homicide::: he was murdered::: likely intentionally.,"""How we at Boston College can and should respond?"" Action. Admission of the struggle at BC::: for many decades::: to respond adequately to racial tensions. Admission of not knowing just how bad it has been::: because you have not listened::: have chosen to not see. Admission of the reality of white privilege in America and in the beloved ""Jesuit tradition:::"" which grew side by side with colonialism. Take action. Words are not enough. As St James said::: ""as the body without spirit is dead::: so faith without deeds is dead.""",I’m an Alum & this was poorly thought out and worded. George Floyd was murdered* he didn’t just magically die in police custody- he had a knee strategically placed on his neck and 2 others on his back. While it is unfair and unjust it is not uncommon and Black people in America die under these circumstances very frequently. Familiarize yourself with the most recent police murders of innocent black men and women- Breonna Taylor::: Amoud Aubrey::: David McAtee& Sean Reed. Lastly::: I hope that there is a plan of action in addition to asking for feedback.,"The word is ""murder""::: Fr. Leahy.",If this was an assignment and I submitted this::: I would fail and face disciplinary consequences for plagiarism. Do better.,Who authorized the dispatch of BCPD to the protest in Dorchester today?,A statement isn’t far-reaching enough and isn’t reflective of the Jesuit call to action. As a start::: here’s a petition we::: as BC alumni::: can endorse and sign: https:// forms.gle/ eyFUcBoL3NSnBg5L 9  “As an institution with over 3.4 billion dollars in net assets::: it is not only our responsibility to support and educate our students::: but to contribute in some tangible way to the fight for justice and equality. There are many other pedagogical institutions that have made statements on the matter::: but a statement itself will not be enough. As kind of a sentiment as it is::: thoughts and prayers will not suffice. It is evident that too often most sentiments expressed towards the mourning black community end up being empty promises. We have failed our minority communities time and time again::: and it is simply unacceptable to flounder again during this historic period. We::: the students of Boston College::: are calling upon you::: our faculty and administration::: for action. We request that you donate to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. As quoted from their official website::: the NAACP was founded in 1909 with a mission to ‘ensure the political::: educational::: social::: and economic equality of all citizens::: to achieve equality of rights and eliminate race prejudice among the citizens of the United States::: to remove all barriers of racial discrimination through democratic processes::: to seek enactment and enforcement of federal::: state::: and local laws securing civil rights:::’ and to educate about and combat racial discrimination. Further::: we expect the institution to explicitly express their support and solidarity for the Black Lives Matter movement.”,Thomas Mysliwicz Read this thread please.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pine Manor College and Boston College have signed a Memorandum of Understanding that will integrate the two institutions in a common mission to serve underrepresented::: first-generation::: low-income students.  BC.EDU Pine Manor College::: Boston College announce institutional agreement,2020-05-13 21:29:49,Intelligent decision for both institutions... there are going to be lots more college closures or consolidations in the coming years,Great to see BC return to its roots of serving local students. Thinking commuting may make a comeback.,Trish Moran,Great for all the kids who won't be going to school for a while!,Excellent...!,Outstanding! Both institutions benefit and the real winners are their respective students.,Great decision Go BC,Fantastic news! Well done BC and Pine Manor! A.M.D.G.,Entered into with the best of intentions::: I’m sure::: but it promotes bigness::: an accretion of power and size for BC::: while stilling an independent voice. I don’t know the specifics::: but think a stewardship program helping Pine Manor continue its individual mission and remaining a separate voice in the community would have been better. Consolidation and agglomeration are banes of existence today.,❤️🦅,Catherine Tobia,Awesome!!!!,Great news- Will this be like the Arrupe program in Chicago?,Handled so much better than the Mount Ida/UMass debacle.,Jessica Pollack Fingold,I really like the approach you are taking.,Well done::: BC.

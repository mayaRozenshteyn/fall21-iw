For the first time in program history::: Georgia Tech Volleyball is one of the top national seeds in the NCAA Division I Women’s Volleyball Championship.

What’s the Good Word??? 🐝,2021-11-27 16:56:03,To 😈 with Georgia!,THWg,What’s the good word? Coaching changes have started.,22 years (1999) since we've beaten Georgia in Atlanta!! Think about that one!,To hell with Georgia!,I just heard a sports analysts on National TV say it was boys playing against men so the Georgia blow out was expected. Our hard working players deserve better than what AD Todd Stansbury has provided them in this hype con-man. They both need to be fired!!,"Go Dawgs you sweet
Georgies!!",We love GA Tech::: but the football team needs help.,To hell with Georiga!,Can we get the engineers to calculate a better algorithm for the score next time,THWg!!!! Up with the white and gold!,THWg!!🐝♥️🐝,#THWg. Go Jackets!,To Hell with Georgia!,Figure out how to beat GA,Go Tech! 🐝,THWG,THWg!,THWG!!!🐝🐝🐝🐝,Go Jackets!,Collins and Stansberry are leaving Tech.,To Hell With Georgia!,THWg!!,THWG!,THWg,Miracle,THWG::: the hell with Geoff!,Go jackets,THWg,Jackets always go in style!,We need coach O,Two good words: Eva Long! :-)8,THWg! 🐝,It's a Rambling Wreck::: of course.,THWG!!!!!,100-0 in our their last two games and they fire position coaches. I don’t care what we owe Collins. The damage to this program has been done. So disappointed in Tech atm. Can’t believe I’m saying this::: but thank god for basketball season.,"The Good Word?
“Geoff Collins has handed me his letter of resignation.”",What do y'all think about us losing the best running back we had in years Jeremy Gibbs has entered the transfer portal,If the ACC is committed to academic excellence first::: then this will be what it will be. Until the SEC does the same. Keep on doing your best boys on and off the field. In the end::: each of you are winners! Go Tech!,"THWg!!!!!!!!! GO JACKETS......KI
LL'EM!!!!!",100-0 in 2 games...,Regardless... it's BUZZ! The yellow jacket!!,"Has anyone else’s received the email today from our AD::: Todd Stansbury. It basically reiterated his disappointment in our season but that under Geoff Collins our recruiting has improved to a top 25 class for two years and he is going to continue to support him and give him time.

Here was my direct response that I sent him;

Mr. Stansbury:::

With all due respect::: I will never call Geoff Collins a coach. He is at best a hype man. He does not exhibit leadership::: discipline or any respect for the traditions that has made Tech great. He takes no personal responsibility for our play and we continue to be one of the most penalized teams in the league::: including repeated unsportsmanlike
penalties. That starts from the top. Remember Mr. Collins refusal to shake Pittsburg’s head coach’s hand after our loss?
The losses are bad enough unto themselves::: (Citadel and Northern Illinois come to mind)::: but his lack of character has made us a laughing stock across the nation. Continuing to make the same mistakes and expecting different results is the definition of stupidity. The longer Collins remains at Tech the more harm he causes to our program::: our school and your reputation as a competent AD. It’s time to admit you made a mistake by giving this conman a seven year contract and cut our losses.

Sincerely:::
Douglas Woodall::: Alumni.",THWg!!!!,THWG!,Go Jackets!! THWG!!,Definitely look better than you play. This team has been an embarrassment. What a joke. Something has got to give. No one is a fan of losing and that’s all we do. Losing fans everyday. Hard to be a fan of a team that loses year in and year out.,THWg! 🐝🐝,This HS Coach last game @ GT !!!!!!,A spoiler victory!! 🐝,THWG,THWG,THWg!,THWg!!🐝🍻🐝,THWg,THWg!!,THWG!!,Go Tech,THWG!! 🐝🐝🐝,THWg!,THWG!!!,THWG!!! 🐝,THWg!!!!,Collins hasn’t been fired yet ???,THWg,Collins is not the answer. 3 wins ain't gonna cut it...,Brian Watson PawPaws car,Beat Georgia!,Sanford West.,Fire Collins!,You need to cheer like h* for GT like yo pappy used to do. #THWg,Wreck tech,Get rid of Collins!!!!,Let’s go Brandon,Jay Treadwell,#THWg,Melissa McConkey Bryson,🐝 🐝🐝,Carla Leonard Thompson,45-0,❤️❤️,❤️🐝👏🏻,Whitney Parks,Beat Georgia!!!,#THWG,45-0 was the word,Go Jackets!

At 4:07 a.m. today::: engineering student Richard Xiong captured this incredible image of an almost total lunar eclipse at the precise moment the moon was positioned at the top of Tech Tower. He calculated the moon’s exact placement to be able to capture this moment — and the chance to take this photo again may not come again for hundreds of years.,2021-11-19 21:17:35,“You’re at Georgia Tech; you can do that!”,Peak GA Tech move to calculate the exact moment. Incredible!,Great determination and patience!,So cool! Amazing job::: Richard!,🐝🌝🐝 The lunar eclipse and Tech Tower. A great combo!,Only a Tech engineer could calculate the exact moment for that incredible photo!🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻,What a great job::: such a once in a lifetime photo💜,Of course a helluva engineer could do this! Stunning!,Unreal. Absolutely amazing!!!!,What a stunning shot!,This is probably one of the coolest pics I have ever seen. Wow. And the thought and care that went into taking it. 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 Sell prints. Proud to be a Jacket! 🤍💛,I doubt there was much calculation involved. More likely a lot of waiting until it was in about the right position and then moving the camera around until IT was in exactly the right position to capture this image.,This is remarkable! Way to go Richard!,My son (the genius) planned on going there when we lived in Georgia. Great school!!!,"This is my favorite photo of our eclipse.
I was so happy and felt so blessed to open my door and view this phenomenal lunar eclipse right in the convenience of my backyard above my trees from 3:45-4:15 AM",That is so beautiful. Great photography skills Richard.,An awesome Jacket! Thanks for this amazing pic!👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🐝🐝🐝🐝,What I most like about this post is the optimism that the Tech Tower will still be there hundreds of years from now.,What a gift to us all!,great camera!!! Awesome student work!,"Gorgeous! Congratulations

Tech. has the talented engineers. Awesome picture.,"Like to know if that is a single image or a composite. If a single image I'd be interested in how he managed to get everything in focus (near and distant objects). That would require a very slow f-ratio. Not saying that it is fake at all! Just interested in the technical data behind. It is a lot more than ""just"" calculating the right time at the right place. Also::: you have to know how your equipment behaves. Well::: he's a tech student::: so he probably knows what he is doing.
Anyways: The image looks great::: no matter whether or not it's a composite.",Fabulous! One Hell of an Engineer ! - #GATech,Fantastic! Sounds like an A+ grade for sure!,As a former college student::: I can say I would just be coming back from a party at that hour and would probably not have noticed there was a moon. So this is very impressive 👏 to me.,There should be chances in 2024::: 2025::: 2026::: and 2027. Those are all more complete or total lunar eclipses::: which should have potential for nice vivid color.,Leave it to a GT engineer 📸👌🏼,Totally awesome! Enjoyed it from my home along the river::: but not nearly so impressive a view of the eclipse::: but the juxtaposition here unbelievable!😎,Beautiful shot! Great job! ❤,"Beautiful!
Thank you Richard.","""He calculated the exact time"" in other words::: he walked around the building::: positioned himself to get the right angle.",Check out Tim Davis profile this is the type of people who represent your school,His professor should give him an🅰️. The calculations are way beyond my skills.,Phenomenal,What an awesome event captured perfectly!,That is so awesome and amazing!!,Only a Tech student would think to do this And get it right!! Go Yellowjackets.,Regardless of what he did or didn't calculate its still a cool shot!,amazing photo but when does the lunar eclipse get the shaft? ;),awesome::: much better than the photo I took!,Hero,Amazing!!,Planning for Perfection! ❤,What a calucative::: precise::: and determined capture!,Helluva Engineer and Photographer!,Wow!

Glad to be a yellow jacket.,I’m ridiculously proud that I was able to vote for this man and I’m able to support a building named in his honor.,✊🏿,What a great honor bestowed on John Lewis‘s family to have a building named in his honor. Usually a building is named after an alumnus who has donated a large amount of their hard earned savings because of their love for their alma mater::: or an individual who has spent most of a lifetime dedicated to the school in some capacity. Very unique circumstance!,Beautiful tribute and proud of my Alma mater.,Beautiful choice. For all those opposing::: you might want to research why naming it after John Lewis is appropriate.

of the great John Lewis. This is perfect!",Wonderful news,👎,Interesting choice. I could see the naming of a center for justice or other political leaning facility for John Lewis (in no way associated with the Institute). The campus is also smack in the middle of numerous other politicians voting districts (mayors::: governors::: senators::: etc.).

"We dug through our archives to find the only picture in existence of Georgia Tech's record 222-0 win over Cumberland College that happened on this day 105 years ago. It's still the largest margin of victory on record in college football.

Tech was coached by John Heisman and in this game never attempted a forward pass and still scored 32 touchdowns. Cumberland never completed a first down.",2021-10-07 17:12:14,Understand that Tech never had a first down either. Maybe just a myth.,Love this! My great uncle Marshall Guill “ Shorty” played under Coach Heisman on that team . My daughter AJ is a junior at Tech now !! 🖤💛🖤,"I am a Tech grad and this is actually kind of embarrassing. Cumberland had shut down their football team before the season and Heisman won't let them off the hook with the game contract::: so they had to scramble to get a team together to honor the contract. Cumberland would have had to pay Tech $3k if they backed out. Heisman gave Cumberland $500 so that they can come play the game. It was payback for Heisman as Cumberland baseball team beat Tech's 22-0 the previous Spring. Conveniently::: Heisman was also Tech's baseball coach. There was nothing honorable about the contest. https://

Georgia Tech enrolled 70% more first-year students from Atlanta’s Public Schools than we did three years ago.

Nearly half of the world’s population lacks access to proper sanitation::: and more than 2 billion people do not have access to toilets or latrines. Diseases caused by poor sanitation kill millions of people each year unnecessarily. That’s why Georgia Tech is leading a global effort to completely reinvent the toilet::: and this team has built a prototype that doesn’t use water intake or septic or sewage systems while killing pathogens and safely disposing of waste. It’s a project with the potential to save millions of lives and we’re proud to be part of it. -- https://c.gatech.edu/3EK5Uhq,2021-09-22 20:14:48,Georgia Tech leads the country in researching crap,🐝👏🏼👏🏼,Wow!,Dude looks like he's peeing.

On September 20::: 1961::: three young men walked on to campus and became the first Black students to attend Georgia Tech.

There was no issues and quite honestly no reaction. Wish it were the case today,"Is there a statue honoring the women who were pioneers? They got water balloons thrown at them and weren’t allowed to be in any honorary society until like 169/70.. regardless of gpa. Some frats wouldn’t let you date a co-ed. Women had a curfew.

Just noting what those ground breaking women had to deal with in the 60’s.",My Sophomore Year 👏👏🐝🐝,And now more girls than boys::: I hear,That was my Freshman Class,And out of state women weren’t allowed until 1968,✊🏾,Much to do about nothing. In Life::: nothing should be given::: but rather earned.,Who’s the first indugenous to graduate from Georgia tech?,I enjoyed my time at Tech and would have been the Class of 1955 but was Drafted for the war.,60% more than five years ago still is a very small number. What can be done to get this to 50% of the entire incoming freshman class - same as the population of Georgia?,Are there any Nigerian students currently enrolled?,Shout out to the Tech👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 keep the excellence!!,Courage!,I was there.,Geez::: it took that long? 1961?,Beautifully displayed‼️,Indeed.,"Parents::: check out the leftist ""teachers"" indoctrinating YOUR kids at this school

"Kevin Lewis wrote about his father's life and legacy in his application to Georgia Tech.
Kevin was just 1 when the September 11 attacks happened just a few miles from his hometown on Long Island. His father::: Andrew::: was an NYPD officer who drove back into the city after his overnight shift and ended up working at ground zero for months helping with the search and recovery effort.

In 2017::: Andrew Lewis lost a valiant battle with 9/11-related brain cancer just a year before his son came to Tech. Kevin is now remembering his father's legacy::: a fourth-year student in civil engineering. ""I want to make the world a better place for everyone else around me just like my father did. I wake up every day determined to be the son::: brother::: and citizen he was shaping me to be.” -- https://c.gatech.edu/September11",2021-09-10 16:19:05,America needs more Kevins now than ever!

"Not long after finishing his master’s degree in architecture at Georgia Tech::: Michael Arad witnessed the tragic events of 9/11 from the rooftop of his apartment building in Manhattan. Crediting his lessons and mentorship at Tech::: Arad designed New York City’s 9/11 Memorial to be a space that allows people to come together and commemorate as a community. His design was chosen from thousands of submissions.

Arad was asked to design a new component for the site::: and he came up with the Memorial Glade::: a space dedicated to first responders and survivors::: workers and residents::: who still feel the effects of the disaster to this day. Thousands were exposed to airborne hazards and toxins around the World Trade Center site::: resulting in chronic illnesses and deaths. Stone monoliths inlaid with steel recovered from the destruction point skyward in the same location where the primary ramp used during the rescue and recovery effort once stood.

Now::: 20 years after the attacks::: the bronzed panels that flank the reflecting pools on all sides::: etched with 2:::983 names of the men::: women::: and children who perished in the attacks remain an integral component of the memorial experience.

“No picture or video can do justice:::” says Arad. “You have to be here to get a sense of the scale and the space to take it in.” -\-\ https://c.gatech.edu/September11",2021-09-09 19:02:11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Am I a bad student,Richard Wilson my OCD cannot handle this.,Now it's like a maze!,back in the 1960s::: there was the Pontiac GTO and the European Gran Tourismo Formula 1 race car series.

Can't go wrong either way!,Do we have to steal the G now as well?,That's been around almost forever::: it seems.,I guess we need to change it every 10 years or so.,Somehow this will be Coach Collins or Coach Hall’s fault.,Good to hear!

So we walk out on the balcony::: and a flashing light in the sky is moving in an weird direction coming right over our heads.

But also I had to share with y'all because his name is Caleb Anderson::: like our newest fave Doctor. 🤓 Caleb F Anderson Jack Jenkins Abbey Siebart Moriah Bacon Curtis Murray","Our FUTURE continues to look amazingly gifted::: highly intelligent::: and extremely BRILLIANT!!!!

Shhhhh.....Here
is a little secret: When Georgia Tech invites alumni/alumnae to return to campus to engage with GT undergraduates.

Imagine a table of eight (8) with two GT alums and six (6) GT undergraduates.
The school asks alums to remain seated while under grads introduce themselves to us...

When we walk between the Student Center and Library we::: alums intently are listening to you.

We observe you on Ga PBS. Undergraduates competing for $25K from venture capitalist within your own firms and you haven’t yet received your undergraduate degrees!!!

In the history of the USA how many 15 year old start Aerospace Engineering????
?

Back at that table of eight we::: alumni hear young folk from across the world. We listen to top graduate students. We learn your future big plans and dreams. We know that our world and FUTURE will be left within your capable hands!!!!

Don’t play us cheap. Every new GT student was among the smartest and brightest student where ever they came across the globe. It is fascinating::: exciting::: and intriguing to witness OUR FUTURE before our eyes!!!!!

As tax paying citizens the faculty and administrators equally have to be among the most stellar performers to maintain their positions.

Every year the caliber of Yellow Jacket grows brighter and smarter!!!!

Some of you are pursuing degrees in technical subjects which weren’t in existence when some of us matriculated at Georgia Tech like bioengineering:::
AI::: nanotechnology:::
etc.

Georgia Tech is steadily throwing red meat to academic lions and great young minds!!!!

It is arduous gaining acceptance into GT. You will learn plenty and SURVIVE your ordeal particularly with your fellow GT schoolmates!!!!
!

Congratulations
! We are exceedingly PROUD of ALL of you!!!!! #AcademicallyGif

Good experience! 🐝,I had so much fun I did it twice.,Lol- I remember FASET and was a FASET leader one summer. Only Ma Tech would have an orientation program with a tortured name like that! 🤣🤣🤣,"At FASET in August 1980::: I met friends I've had for 41 years now. We also had record high temps over 100° and were housed in unairconditione

"25 years ago::: Georgia Tech's campus served as the heart of Olympic Village – where athletes lived::: journalists reported::: and visitors from around the world gathered for the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. Tech also served as the venue for swimming::: diving::: synchronized swimming::: water polo::: modern pentathlon::: boxing::: and Paralympic volleyball.

We're sharing a few of our favorite Olympic stories and images from the Games that changed our campus and city forever. Share your memories (and photos if you've got them!) in the comments below.",2021-07-23 16:35:40,GT and metro ATL did an amazing job hosting the Olympics and the athletes!,"This was such an amazing time to be at Georgia Tech and in Atlanta::: both during the Olympics and in the time prior to Atlanta winning the bid in 1990 to host the event. I worked with a group of students::: faculty::: and staff known as the Georgia Tech Olympic Coalition (GTOC) that helped to welcome IOC delegations to campus when they came to visit Atlanta when we were competing for the bid. We did other things to raise campus awareness of Atlanta's bid for the Olympics prior to the 1990 announcement. In the period between 1990-1996::: GTOC turned its focus toward a variety of community service projects::: and those of us who were interested in volunteering for the 1996 Olympics could keep a record of volunteer activities that could be used to apply for a volunteer spot. I did that::: and I got my first pick and ""dream job"" choice of where I wanted to volunteer -\-\ the basketball and gymnastics venues at the Georgia Dome. While working::: I got to see much of the competition for free::: and I worked some press conferences::: including the one with Kerri Strug after the women's team captured the team gold medal (I got to see the competition where they won the gold too and saw Kerri stick that vault while injured). I also got to run disks for Associated Press photographers to their dedicated lab during the men's basketball team's game vs. China::: and got to see digital photography in its infancy::: with images being transmitted via computer to their offices in Boston. Seeing the GT campus transformed into the Olympic Village was amazing and seeing the world come together at that time is something that I will always cherish. Along with GTOC's hospitality::: Georgia Tech's technical know how helped the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games capture the bid::: with its 3D multimedia presentations::: and the solar powered roof that was installed and monitored on the aquatic center is still in operation at the Campus Recreation Center today (faculty researchers from my school monitored the rooftop system's performance at the time and they still do today). The Olympic torch was designed by Georgia Tech faculty too. There are even more GT contributions that I'm not remembering right now::: but those are just a few. Having the Olympics here was truly game-changing for both Atlanta and Georgia Tech. I will always::: always remember it. ❤",At the time I was working in the Baker Building. A while before the Olympics::: we had to start parking at a lot near Atlantic Steel::: and then catch a shuttle bus. I ended up taking leave the whole time of the Olympics so that I wouldn't have to deal with the mess of getting to work. Also::: we had lots of family members coming into town to see the games.,And what an incredible venue it turned out to be:::America did it self proud xx,Hanging with Katie Couric in the Student Center. I designed the electric trams for transporting the athletes inside the Olympic Village and supported the electric buses in the Village.,Wish I had pics but I was there in the middle of it. They built the GaState dorms (now GT) across N Ave. The center of campus was torn up and there were fences everywhere. About every building on campus was used for some Olympic purpose (housing::: meeting::: etc). Exciting times and after it was over the campus and surrounding area benefited (IMHO) tremendously!,Fencers practicing outside of Towers Residence Hall,I was on the step team in the Opening Ceremony. It was such an amazing experience. To see that side of the production was fascinating. Met some amazing people.,Watching Muhammad Ali with the opening ceremony torch 🔥. I was 8 that year and fortunately visiting Atlanta for the summer. A great time to be there.,I had a fabulous time at those Olympics and felt so fortunate to have them hosted by my own city. Little did I know that I would begin working at Tech 5 years later and stay for 15 years!,We were living in Charlotte NC at the time. I was a radio call-in contest addict and won 4 tickets to an Olympic baseball game. My kids and I drove to Atlanta and stayed with old-time NJ friends. On the morning of the baseball game we walked through the Olympic area. Of all the thousands of people in Atlanta that weekend::: I bumped into my old sports writing boss from NJ who was covering the events. What a great weekend! btw::: my younger son is a GT alumnus!,I worked for the Olympic Village Logistics Division and had a blast. Eating in the dining hall::: concerts at the night club (right next to the ISyE building)::: the video and virtual reality arcade::: so much fun. I actually wrote an article about it for IIE Solutions magazine back then.,I was at Tech then. Remember walking to class and then the next day having to walk half a mile out of the way because a construction fence popped up. Happened many times leading up to the games.,My husband work for the AFD when the Olympics was there and he got a several pins.,Got out the quarter after the Olympics (10 weeks shortened to 7) 2 lab classes::: so 12 hours a week in the lab- for about 4 of those weeks. It was very interesting to see all the building being done and what they would all turn into afterwards. I intentionally escaped Atlanta during the Olympics.,I was working in CRB and did the whole “park at Atlantic Steel and ride a shuttle bus” grind (and then parked in what’s now the GTRI/GPB deck on 14th during the Paralympics). I was able to get a day pass and walk through campus (to get lunch at Junior’s) one day::: and it was amazing to see how completely they transformed campus (and the whole city::: really).,Who's down for reviving pin trading this weekend downtown? :),"I was so fortunate to get a job that summer (the summer between my freshman and sophomore year at Tech) working in the Tech bookstore (which was right next to the Student Center). It was turned into a souvenir and sundry shop for the athletes. I got to meet a ton of athletes::: got many athlete pins::: NBC hosted their Today show every morning from the textiles building across the sidewalk (where they had removed an entire wall of that building to have a better background for the show)::: and saw several government officials from the US and other countries. Only scary experience was the day I was eating lunch outside on campus and the cops were searching trash cans for bombs the day after the Centennial Park bombing. Other than that one of the absolute coolest experiences of my life!!

I was also fortunate to see a diving competition on campus and attend the Women’s Gymnastics team final where the US won their first team gold medal (the famous Kerri Strug vault)!",I was there. I lived close enough to ride my bicycle in. There was a parking lot next to the Van Leer building where I parked my bike. One of the gates to get into the village was next to that. You did a hand scan and they checked your Olympic ID. Once inside the village::: we could do all things that the athletes could do. Not much work was done at Georgia Tech those 3 weeks.,My husband could tell you some great stories about working in the Village!!!,I was only two when the games were in Atlanta but my moms friend did help carry the torch so I still got to be in on the action!,I remember the fall quarter starting in October if I recall correctly.,This picture is taken across from the cafeteria. Back in 1991 I took a job that was located in that white building in the background. I stayed in a hotel (and ate dinner every night at the wendys out front) that was in this spot back then. Obviously they were flattened to make way for the olympic buildings. Fast forward to 2016 and my son is at georgia tech - and he lived in those dorms (the picture is of us visiting him and me reminding him that his parents lived where the cafeteria is now and I worked in the white building LOL). Fast forward to 2019 and he graduated from tech and took a job in that same white building.,The great Muhammad Ali walking past me outside the Student Center.,The Terminator walking past me before the world premiere of the movie “Eraser.”,I got out just before the Games started but it was magical to be there!,My husband worked for Institute Communication and Public Affairs. My boys and I waited to see him at the BP on North Avenue. We met scores of athletes. This is Fatima Roba of Ethiopia who won the women's marathon the day before.,"I was a GT student at the time and volunteered that summer in the village putting on concerts to entertain the athletes. I can't seem to find any of the concert pictures::: they were mostly local acts that played on the lawn outside the student center. However::: the big show was Hootie and the Blowfish at Grant Field. It was an amazing summer!

Here's a picture of the student center and the fountain lit up with the rings.","I was::: and still am::: working for GTRI in CRB and also parked in the Atlantic Station parking lot. I had an Olympic Village pass for the Research Control Zone although it wouldn't allow me in the athlete's village. I did tour it when it was under construction.

I remember there was a Usenet group named git.general that was similar to the gatech subreddit. After the 10 foot chain link with razor wire above it went up::: someone posted that the Board of Regents was going to rename us ""The Georgia Correctional Institute of Technology."" I wish someone had made shirts with that.",What the good old day. Here is a picture of my advisor Professor Smith on final torch relays prior to the opening ceremony,I worked to keep the Tech Student Services office open during the summer. My office was a skybox at Grant Field. I shook President Clinton’s hand. I met gymnast Dominique Moceanu at the on-campus McDonald’s the day after she was on David Letterman. And walked behind Amy Van Dyken in the security line after she tried to walk thru the metal detectors with 4 gold metals inside her jacket (hint: they have to be removed and x-rayed)! Best of all… dating ACOG Olympic Village volunteer and Tech CE student Koren Harris.,And some GT employees also worked for Atlanta Olympic Broadcasting!,I got to see the Bronze and Golf medal soccer matches at Sanford in Athens… the atmosphere around the city was so electric.,I came to some of the swimming events when i was 12 and lived in Augusta- not knowing that less than a decade later I’d be spending a whole lot more time on campus.,"Atlanta 1996::: Nigeria shocks the world by beating Argentina 3-2 to Gold in the Men's Football Tournament.
Atlanta 2021::: I'm representing Nigeria in the College of Computing 😃.",After GTOC::: I worked with the athletes in the Village::: at my old dorm. So much fun::: many wonderful memories::: lots of photos::: and one of the athletes I met is one of my best friends. A few of us stayed up till around 5 a.m. many days sharing jokes. Photo with Mongolia team member.,My now 32 year old son with the torch.,"A staffer that was on campus had a website with a bunch of early digital camera photos of campus. The site is still up!

"On this day in 1994::: the Atlanta Olympic Committee broke ground on Georgia Tech’s campus for the Olympic Aquatic Center::: the swimming and diving venue for the 1996 games. The facility was designed by husband-and-wife duo Bill and Ivenue Stanley::: Tech’s first Black architecture graduates.

After the Olympics::: the facility was enclosed and repurposed to become Georgia Tech’s state-of-the-art Campus Recreation Center. The pool and diving well remain and have hosted countless Olympians for training and competition.",2021-07-06 19:41:36,"Fun Fact: I swam in a mock swim meet at the Georgia Tech Aquatic Center a few weeks before the ""real"" Olympics began. They recruited swimmers from year-round clubs across the State of Georgia::: and I had the honor of swimming the 50 meter freestyle for ""Sweden"" and the 800 medley relay for ""Korea"". It was the most awesome experience of my life... And it solidified my desire to attend Tech ❤ It sounds weird::: but I still dream about that Olympic experience... It was so surreal to experience it.",in 1996 I watched the women’s USA Synchronized Swim team win GOLD… had front row center pool seats.. was amazing 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸,I attended water polo events during the 1996 Games. Water polo was held at the outside pool adjacent to the swim/dive pool. Like many local kids::: my Jacket swam at the Aquatic Center several times for the championships of summer swim league. It was very cool to be on the pool deck as a parent volunteer.,"In 1996::: we moved to Atlanta::: and only Olympic (ticket) we could afford was to watch the wrestling (and this event has been dropped this year :-)).. Fast forward::: almost a quarter century later::: looking fwd to seeing my yellowjacket checking in to Olympic Village (his New Dorm/
apartment)::: for the year 2021~2022 ..",I was a student there from 1991-1995::: so during the construction phase of the Olympic facilities. My father::: also a GT alum::: Pat McNew::: did the live deck announcing at the 1996 Paralympics::: so we got to attend some of those events::: which were amazing. We were unable to get tickets for Olympic swimming::: but we did see a gymnastics preliminary event and a baseball game.,A photo I've taken::: after the final of the 1995 Water Polo World Cup. The photo was taken on September 17::: 1995. You can see the new construction still going on in the background. I just moved to the 8th Street Apartments::: but even there the landscaping was yet to be done.,So many things I love about this post::: especially the mention of the architects! Tech and its community never needed forced policy change and incentives to recognize and honor ability coming from anyone!,awesome venue!! saw Olympic water polo there ::: as most memorable event. among others. YAAAYYY Georgia Tech!,Bill and Ivenue are great Tech supporters. Enjoyed working with them while I was there.,"During an Olympic swimming event I attended at that beautiful venue::: there was an incident in the stands where a man in a cap with a neck cape (one of those French Foreign Legion caps) sat by himself. The crowd in the area became agitated. It looked serious. But security arrived and::: after a moment::: escorted the man out peacefully.

Later::: I saw him in the fenced-off area on the Tech Parkway side::: watching the swimming from an area overlooking the end of the pool.

It was Bruce Willis. He had tried to attend anonymously to watch some swimming::: and was not successful.",I remember the construction. I was also one of the first residents of 8th street dorms (south).. when we moved in the elevators weren’t working yet 😩😂,Another fun fact: I still have plants from the aquatic center in 1996. I was a lifeguard after the olympics and took some home to care for them over the break. We split a few and still have them 25 years later.,"My wife and I attended some events at GT during the 1996 Olympics. One I remember was water polo. The competition was fierce but the athletes were very friendly and would interact with the crowd.
My wife was pregnant with our first son then::: and some 18 years later he attended GT as an aerospace engineer student. He has now graduated from GT with his masters in aerospace engineering. Works at Lockheed Martin in Atlanta!",I was trained to be a pool operator over 20 years later while getting my degree! Love the history of these pools.,I was a member of the USA 1996 Paralympic Games team!,I was a student when this was being built! The Olympics transformed Tech and nearby.,"I used to swim in the Old Gym::: next to Grant Field::: lol.

It probably doesn’t exist anymore.",Greatest pool and venue I have ever been and diving into! As a trainee from abroad I used to attend some practice sessions of a local SwimClub in 1999 and very much enjoyed the cool and stunning sunset atmosphere in the evening due to the pool‘s open architecture to three sides. One could still hear the crowd cheering to the Olympic swimmers of years before. What a long lasting experience::: also walking on campus! 👌,I found US Swimmer Brooke Bennett lost on North Ave.::: and rushed her in my golf cart to the Natatorium just in time where she won the gold.,Wow::: it looks very good being from 1994. 😮👍,I did my time at the center as a volunteer and a translator. Had a great time.,The 340kW grid connected photovoltaic array on the rooftop was the world’s largest at the time. #UCEP,Pat DuRant,Josh Ames,Alayna Lamberth,Interesting Austin Bryan Steven Craig Bryan,Best pool!!,One of my favorite places.,I was there.,Mike Helmase,"Epic House of writers

"Georgia Tech’s Kendeda Building is the greenest building on any college campus in America::: and today it becomes one of only 28 buildings in the world to be certified as a Living Building::: the most ambitious::: environmentally sound building achievement on the planet.

The building’s solar panels generate more than double the electricity needed to power it::: and the extra is returned to the grid for adjacent buildings. The solar panels also help collect and treat 15 times more water than the building needs. All told::: this building creates more energy than it uses::: and the lessons we’ve learned will shape not only future construction projects on Georgia Tech’s campus but all over the world as well. | https://c.gatech.edu/3eroQ88",2021-04-22 14:23:33,So glad Tech stays ahead of the abuse of our plant!🐝. Go Jackets!,Leading edge technology. It would be interesting to see how the actual cost of this option compares to traditional structures.,"Campus was densely packed when I was a student over 10 years ago::: I can only imagine it's gotten worse now... replacing those solar panels in 20-30 years is going to be expensive and difficult.

On the plus side::: the architecture seems to fit the theme of the other newer buildings on campus.",Just imagine the lower tuition costs that can be charged due to the energy savings! 😂,I was wondering what the cost was for the solar panels and their installation separate from the cost of the building construction. I know panel prices have come down considerably in recent years. (Cool looking building by the way!),I wonder if the solar panels::: being elevated above the roof it appears::: reduces the solar load on the building thus requiring less energy to cool.,And it doesn’t sacrifice on design aesthetic ... very cool looking building !!,So proud of GT for leading the way to solutions for a greener planet!,"Bragging time again..if my kid was not residing at Freeman Residence::: might have missed crossing this building('s two adjacent sides ) on every trip...Little that I knew it's one of the 8th Wonder.. ""World's Greenest Building""",Great news - keep advancing the Green standards!,Ga Tech - you never disappoint!,Not surprised that it’s on the campus of one of the greatest universities in the world 🌎,Such amazing technology!,It's also a very beautiful building::: demonstrating a very important point that efficiency and aesthetics don't have to be mutually exclusive!,Can I ask a question because I am curious? We have to clean our solar panels a couple of times a year::: at least::: because of pollen::: etc. Do you do that? I know it would be a large undertaking.,What’s the Cost for All this High Technology???,Congrats to all involved in this project! Ya an amazing building at the students are lucky to have it.,Does it have battery storage so it can operate through the night and for periods of clouds and rain? I would guess not. At some point it relies on central station power to function.,Ah::: my old tailgating space grew up to be a building.,love it::: please tell me that we are using US made solar panels!,GO Jackets - - always!!,It’s a shame they had to move that cemetery and church to build that building.

The contemplative plaza inside Georgia Tech's newly opened EcoCommons offers a space for the community to reflect on the quest for dignity::: access::: and equality.

And yes I questioned the racial segregation,LeRoy Dorman remember the Pickrick? Sam (O.C.) insisted that dad take the family to eat there on one of our trips to Atlanta. Really good fried chicken.

"Today::: Georgia Tech received additional doses of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine from the Georgia Department of Public Health.
Starting Thursday::: we'll be following the expanded criteria to include everyone aged 16 and older. This effectively covers 100% of the Georgia Tech community.

We have opened new vaccination appointment slots and will accept appointments until all slots are taken. Georgia Tech is only administering the vaccine to active members of the campus community: students::: staff::: faculty::: and affiliates. Find more information and appointment registration here: https://mytest.gatech.edu/",2021-03-24 18:44:20,Great news! This is a great chance for Tech to show how this can be done quickly and effectively. #wecandothat,I hope the professors are prioritized for vaccination. They are the ones at risk for serious illness.,100%? how great! On the other hand::: none of us::: citizens of my country Japan::: has had vaccines. lol,Thank you for setting a great example for the rest of our state! As usual!,Are all 16 and up eligible in the state of GA now? All the new appointment slots are full. But students can get at pharmacies if the GA eligibility says.

"Jean McDowell Ray came to Georgia Tech in 1960 as one of Tech’s first women to study chemical engineering. She couldn’t study chemistry as she’d hoped because women were only allowed to choose majors that weren't available to them at other schools. After following the curriculum::: she filed for a change of major to chemistry using her initials::: D.J. McDowell::: and it was approved.
Having already taken the prerequisites::: Jean’s major change request was granted::: and she earned her degree in chemistry in 1965. The following year::: all academic departments at Tech were opened to women. Jean McDowell went on to work for Boeing developing materials for airplanes. #WomensHistoryMonth",2021-03-23 19:12:48,And women are still fighting to control our destinies.,It makes my teeth grind together to read these stories. On the other hand::: I was admitted to the UVa. medical school in 1973 because they were under pressure to enroll more women.....,Good for DJ McDowell!! My first quarter at Georgia Tech was the summer of 1965 with a ChE major. DJ’s story is appealing to me.,Thank you Ms. McDowell for paving the way for the rest of us! IM’87,Good for her! Just ignorant that she had to go that route.,Unbelievable hurdles! These women paved the way for the generations that followed!!,Thank you Jean! My daughter earned her degree in Chemistry from Tech in 2021.,In my lifetime. Never lose track of the rights and the opportunities. They weren’t always there.,Tech women have long been described as ugly (as if brains and looks were incompatible). Look at those cute ladies. Glad I was also one.,Thank you::: D.J.McDowell! From a 1986 B.S. Chemistry grad! 👩🏻‍🎓,Book smart and street smart 👏,Love this story - where there is a will - there is a way,I think D.J. McDowell needs to start showing up on some rosters with George P. Burdell!,I am a ChE grad and good she opened the door for me and many of my classmates in the 1970s.,Never heard this story - go DJ! 👏,Sidenote - If you want a shocker::: look up when women got the right to vote (federally) in Switzerland. I can't believe it was 1971 (and 1991 in one canton.),Hard to believe people were so stupid back then. I've taken graduate level courses in chemistry with some very smart women.,Kudos to you::: Jean!!,Bully for her. She figured out a solution to the problem like a true engineer!,Thank you Jean!! From a B.S. Biochem 2005 😃,These women paved the way for ME to start Tech in 1971. I will be forever grateful to them for overcoming their challenges.,Lindsey Ulmer another amazing Tech woman in chemistry!,"Miranda Munoz yo this is really interersting.

Bill::: well said ! TURNING NEGATIVES INTO POSITIVES.... THAT'S LIFE !,Wait! Did not you tell us the entire last year not to travel? These guys may have followed proper social distancing but still not something that should be advertised. Besides::: 95% of your student population can’t afford this lifestyle because of the hefty fees you take::: so it sure doesn’t bring in positive vibes in most of us.,Adapting to the situation!!! What a great way to git er done! Way to go men !!!,Impressive!! Kudos to them for being creative!,"This is great. No matter how this was possible::: they will always remember.

To help as many local students as possible earn a Georgia Tech degree::: beginning this spring any first-year applicant not admitted will have a guaranteed transfer offer via the newly launched APS Pathway Program. The program will guarantee a spot for any Atlanta Public School student to transfer to Tech after completing 30 hours of credits in their intended major while maintaining a 3.3 GPA. -- http://c.gatech.edu/APSPathways,2021-03-08 16:52:59,"This is excellent. It is a matter of national security that we get more students of color graduated with STEM degrees. I remember when I went to Agnes Scott in the late 70's::: I only saw 2-4 African American students at Georgia Tech. There were very few women as well. This is a way to offset the soclai/
economic preferences that while-male student have had for sooo many years. This is a way to give poorer male and female underrepresente
d students a chance to be engineers.",What a great program. Love to see the tie in with local public schools. You build the community that you live in.,Everyone on here who is mad is missing the point. These programs start small and expand as they thrive and prove worth it. The fact that this is even starting should be applauded and supported.,Why just APS? There are school systems all over the state::: with students who did not exactly excel in high school::: who arguably could use a second chance?,This is not right. What about rural communities? Don’t they deserve a spot as well?,This is ridiculous unless you open it up to all students.,"Inequality before the law was often an old norm in America. There are many who intend to make it a new norm.

Still::: sometimes the simplest explanation is the best-\-\-one very good explanation for the explicit favoritism of one geographic area was that this was lobbying by those who work at Georgia Tech to make sure their kids can one day get in. And that the administration had no moral courage to oppose. They could care less about the kid for Newnan::: nor Savannah::: nor Augusta::: nor Albany. It's about their kid having hope::: after all ""that sacrifice"" the parent did for the school.

This program will hopefully expand to other areas of the state (just as the valedictorian program did)::: as GT decides to every so often treat all equally under the law...despite itself. Still::: the fact is not everyone can get in or transfer in::: and given how long GT fought against other engineering schools being started in the state::: it to me is once more proof that it really doesn't think it is owned by the people of the state of Georgia::: but just by those who work there. I often think it has zero sense of what the word ""stewardship on behalf of all Georgians"" means. Nor cares.",It’s so hard to stay at Tech that I feel like this is setting up students for failure. The problem is not getting in::: the challenge is staying and actually graduating. It’s not as easy as it seems,"This just makes it that much harder for out of state students to be accepted at Tech....and it's already disproportionat
ely much more difficult as it is.",As an alum of Georgia Tech::: this is not the only program they have where students transfer in. It would do well for people to actually do their research rather than complain. I am honestly appalled at some of these comments. You do not know these students’ circumstances and it’s not a handout. Good grief. I personally think it’s a good idea.,Whatever you think if you deserve to be at Tech you will be at Tech. Plain and simple. The handouts and trophy for all mentality are what is wrong with America. I am a Mexican American so don’t give me your racist minority monologue either. I earned my way in. I paid for all my own school by working hard and graduated with a meaningful degree.,Don’t degrade a superb school with substandard students to make people feel good. If you deserve to be at Tech you will be at Tech. This is pathetic.,Well there goes more pandering. The degree has no value if just anyone can get one. Why don’t they just skip the whole school thing and just mail everybody a diploma.,I remember when My parents and other black citizens of Ga paid state tax and we were not allowed to attend Ga State Tax Funded Schools - that was wrong on so many levels. It wasn’t that long ago.,just keep high standards and admit only the best of the best.,As a science educator in APS::: this is exciting! Can't wait to share with my students!,If they can't excel in high school how will they excel at GA Teach? Setting them up for failure. So a child can get a 3.3 from West GA and be expected to survive at Tech?,Why just Atlanta. It is especially hard for boys to get acceptance!,Good form::: Georgia Tech! Good form!,For those who are upset::: did you to have tech? Just wondering... what we are all upset about here?? 😕,I really dont see the issue. They have to maintain high grades to transfer and presumably the program helps prepare them for the rigors of Tech. If it helps improve Diversity in STEM::: which is a huge deficit::: I'm all for it.,This is awesome! Georgia Tech is serving its community.,Great program. But why not all of Georgia?,Hope isn't open to all students::: but that's not an issue. As someone who graduated from Ga Tech::: this is a great opportunity for more local students to get an education at one of the world's best schools. Rather than complaining::: why not come up with ways to expand opportunities.,YES I MEAN parents bought them SAT tutors::: paid extra to live in a ‘good’ school district - WE WORKED 2 JOBS AND/OR OVERTIME AND TIGHTLY BUDGETED - SO WE COULD PAY FOR THOSE THINGS FOR OUR GIRLS - tho our GT girl chose to do the SAT book on her own rather than the classes because it was cheaper for us but harder for her - - DO NOT PRESUME TO SAY THAT SHE/WE WERE SOMEHOW PRIVILEDGED TO GET IN TO GT - SHE EARNED IT IN EVERY WAY. AND WE ARE SO PROUD OF HER. - - SO NO I DO NOT WANT YOUR KID GETTING IN BECAUSE HE LIVES IN ATLANTA AND USES A SHORTCUT GO ROUND TO GET IN. -IT DEVALUES GT AND THE DEGREES AWARDED. - I DO NOT WANT TO SEE THAT HAPPEN TO A GREAT SCHOOL. SO THERE. 🐝,My youngest daughter has two GT graduate siblings. She had the grades and credits to transfer in and was still turned away twice — even the counselor said he didn’t understand why she wasn’t being accepted. Just frustrating that now (because of COVID no doubt) all the universities are making exceptions likely because they need the $$$.,That’s long been a practice that kids would go to another school and prove themselves and could transfer in. Seems like they are just making it a little more official..,30 hours of credit in their intended major? So they come in as a junior?,Will be interesting to see how many transfer and make it to graduation,Should be extended to Dekalb as well::: especially schools such as Clarkston High::: Tucker::: etc.,Should not limit only to students from Atlanta public schools 🤔,Local should mean the state of Georgia!,Might be developed aa a diversity program working with the city of Atlanta.,You have to start somewhere. It will settle to a norm in a few years.,This should be offered to anyone wanting to go to Tech.,APS ::: the same school system caught in cheating scandal not long ago?,Wow!! Way to go TECH!!,Pam Howard,Brooklyn Caruso Cesar Torres,I think this is a wonderful plan!,This is great!,Wonderful!,I love this!

When Caleb Anderson was just three years old he became the youngest Black American male to qualify for MENSA.

We are fortunate and blessed to experience a living legend!!!!!

Does anybody else hear the whistle when looking at this photo? The Tech Whistle is the oldest recorded tradition at Georgia Tech with the first steam whistle installed in the fall of 1892. 🐝 (IG/ian_campbell_19),2021-02-25 15:33:22,I lived in 4 different apartments during my 5 years in Atlanta::: and I could hear the whistle from all of them 🐝,I used to work in the A. French building. I know the Whistle quite well!,I live 5 miles from Tech and on a low-traffic day I can hear the whistle at my house.,My dad! Maintained the whistle for 20 years. Harold Cash,I used to work in Tech Tower and I loved that whistle!!!,Many years ago when I worked on the academic side of Tech::: I used to hear it all the time::: signaling that certain classes would end soon!,Some friends of mine dressed up like the A-Team and stole that thing with a torch and some bolt cutters in 1997.,I had an office in the A French building and the whistle was 30 ft away::: I still have ringing in my ears,I was a student at Tech from 63 to 67. I can’t remember the year::: but one of the frats stole the whistle one night. They polished it up and returned it. I remember that on the day it was stolen the school tried several temporary fixes. A few days later there was a replacement. The story went around that an alumnus who supposedly lived in the Biltmore hotel and woke up to the whistle had donated money to replace it. Yes ::: people still lived in the Biltmore in the 1960s.,Nothing better than a professor in Skiles finishing the last sentence right as the Whistle blows,Now the whistle blows in the middle of all of my classes ... something may be off lol,I remember it well! Class of ‘64.,Love the whistle.,Dr. Gatland still talks about the whistle being so close to his office for decades that he stopped hearing it after a while.,I hear that whistle in my dreams 33 years later!,David Geer,And stopping when it DOES blow,Go Jackets!!!!!,Carson Bliss,Mohammad Ali Muttaqi I imagine you everytime I hear the whistlr,"Bill Stewart

My daughter Sana Ajani now works at Microsoft. I have seen the growth and transformation in her during the 4 years at Tech. Can’t thank the school enough 👍,Proud mother of a senior daughter at Georgia Tech who is graduating with Industrial Engineering!,At my freshman orientation in ‘86::: we were told to look at the person to our right and the person to our left. Then they said that one of the three of us wouldn’t be at Tech the next year. The school was proud of the fact that they weeded out so many “unworthy” students.,Thank you GT for giving me such a wonderful opportunity to start my career in the US. I got my EE degree from Tech at the age of 42 and had been a stay at home mom for around 10 years. It was not an easy journey as I had to start from the GED classes.... Now my son is at GT,"So does GA Tech partake in the ""free college"" (supposedly) provided by the GA Lottery? Retention is great metric. Question is: what is the GPA in the engineering course studies?

"In a new space on campus::: Georgia Tech will be recognizing the painful past of segregation and the courage of those who sought to end it.

Our new EcoCommons includes the former site of the Pickrick Restaurant::: which was located off campus in the 1960s. The Pickrick closed to avoid a federal mandate to serve Black customers. When the EcoCommons opens later this year::: it will feature a display that honors the men who were assaulted when trying to enter the restaurant – as well as space for contemplation and reflection for our entire community. | http://c.gatech.edu/TheJourneyContinues",2021-02-16 17:36:32,Was this later the Placement Center?,"I saw the construction taking place on the grounds of the old Pickrick Cafe.

This sounds like a very appropriate memorial to the ugliness that was once there.",During my undergraduate days at Tech in the early 70s::: a black construction worker died when a ditch caved in on him in front of the Student Center. I think iw was during construction of what was then the bookstore. I thought the bookstore building had been named in his memory but could be mistaken on that.

My husband was beginning his junior year in Architecture in ‘72 when he took me to dinner in Atlanta and then a late night adventure to Grant Field. He wanted to show me the view. We walked up the ramps to the very top south corner of the west stands and it was magical! (Don’t know if we were really allowed to be there::: but no one stopped us. 😏) Beautiful::: romantic view of the twinkling skyline! He surprised me with a proposal in that magical spot. I said yes! and we married a year later. I got a job in the GT library working at the Reserve Desk::: he began his Senior year::: and we moved into married student housing in the Healy high-rise just off 10th St (gone now) in a south-facing apartment with a million dollar view of the city and campus.

In 1968 Augustine Esogbue became the world’s first Black Ph.D. in the field of industrial engineering. Less than a decade later::: he became Georgia Tech’s first Black tenured professor and co-founded Georgia Tech’s chapter of the National Society of Black Engineers. Esogbue has mentored generations of scholars and his influence helped change the landscape of engineering in America by developing successful programs designed to cultivate and nurture minority success in STEM fields -- http://c.gatech.edu/3pTRZNS,2021-02-04 19:29:25,"Congratulations

Dr Esogbue for the many years you served as campus advisor for GT SBE.

This Black History post incorrectly states that Dr Esogbue was a
co-founder of GT chapter of NSBE. Following the lead of Black engineering students at Purdue University in 1975::: Black undergraduate students at Tech organized the GT chapter of Society of Black Engineers with GT Admin Dean of Engineering::: William ""Bill"" Schutz. The Dean appointed Dr Esogbue as the first advisor for this campus organization.

The chartering of GT chapter of NSBE was all student based. I was a Charter Member of GT chapter of SBE in 1976.

Its important that we are accurate with the history about the Black Experience at Tech.

"Dr. Anthony Fauci::: one of the nation’s leading infectious disease experts and a steadfast voice of science::: facts::: and medical best practice during one of the most significant public health challenges in U.S. history::: is this year’s recipient of Georgia Tech's Ivan Allen Jr. Prize for Social Courage.

This annual award honors individuals who have stood up for moral principles at the risk of their careers and livelihoods. As a trusted face in the fight against Covid-19::: Fauci faced public criticism and was subjected to enormous pressure in response to his public messages. Despite these challenges::: Fauci has continued to deliver his clear and unwavering assessment of the facts and science and provide critical advice to guide the nation and world. | http://c.gatech.edu/Fauci",2021-01-25 12:31:00,"As an Alumni well done! Let the science lead the way! History will look back at those who have the courage to explain and follow the body of scientific/
medical knowledge no matter the noise of the moment. Congratulations Dr. Fauci and GT!!",I worked with Dr. Fauci in the CDC's Emergency Operations Center. He is definitely the best choice for this award :),As a Hospitalist physician Yellow Jacket::: this makes my heart happy !,This makes me even prouder to be an alumna and mother to a current undergrad. I’m proud of GT for being on the right side of history,It’s so sad to me that some of my fellow alumni criticizing this choice were taught the scientific method::: but don’t understand why Fauci’s advice changed as we learned more about the virus. They fail to realize it was literally the scientific method happening in real time. As a Yellow Jacket and physician::: I applaud this choice!,Fantastic and appropriate recognition for such a deserving recipient. Thanks to him for his continued service::: and to the GT committee for honoring him!,Being a twice graduate (BS/MS) from Ivan Allen School of International Affairs::: I am proud of this choice as Dr. Fauci embodies the tenants of this award.,Very apt application of this award and well deserved by this brave man::: steadfast in science.,What a great choice::: Georgia Tech! Proud of Fauci for always following the science.,Thank you GT::: proud alumna.,Dr. Fauci is such a wonderful and deserving choice for recipient of Georgia Tech's Ivan Allen Jr. Prize for Social Courage! I'm so proud that both my girls are students at GT... ❤️🐝,As a recent alum::: I am very proud of this choice! Dr. Fauci fits this description perfectly.,Hahaha people thinking GaTech is some liberal hippy paradise. It is a meat grinder for the STEM field. So many 1-in-3 speeches to entering classes that you will fail out or switch majors due to the difficulty. And even if you fail classes at Tech you are still top tier compared to other institutions. So yeah::: Fauci earned this praise with his achievements and dedication to Science and Medicine.,Excellent choice! A man of honor,Love this! Dr Fauci is very deserving of this honor. I am thankful we have him continuing in his role!,Thank you::: Georgia Tech for honoring Dr. Fauci in this way. He's a true hero::: not only for his work on Covid::: but for his continuous work on epidemics during his career.,Thank you::: GT and big thanks to Dr. Fauci for working to keep us informed and up to date with scientific finding during this pandemic. As an alumna::: our society's distrust of science and the scientific process is concerning. 💗,Just one more reason I love GT and so thankful my granddaughter is a student there. Thank you so much for this well deserved recognition.,"Way to go Georgia Tech! Proud of my alma mater (and employer) for recognizing the work of this extraordinarily
competent man::: doing his job calmly under awful opposition.","As a proud Georgia Tech Alum (ME 98) and a current NCI surgeon-scienti
st at the NIH::: this is a most fitting tribute to a man who knew he needed to keep speaking scientific reality no matter who was listening and in spite of the many threats he received. Fantastic choice for this award. Congratulations
::: Dr. Fauci.",Judging by the comments to this news::: I wonder what exactly they are teaching at Georgia Tech? I was there for an internship one summer and thought this was a great school for science and facts.,"Congratulations
! I'm thankful he wasn't manipulated by bullying::: intimidation and defamation.",Science is always changing::: thank you for always looking out for our best interest.,No doubt a great academic success::: even if I do find his suggestions and current actions abhorrent and unethical. For the purposes of the award itself::: he's as good as any.,Taking flack on social media for his commitment to honesty and transparency is literally the reason listed for why he was this year’s recipient (it’s called the social ~courage~ prize for a reason). So::: I find it only fitting that some want to use this honor as a space to come after a man who’s dedicated his life to serving the American public for over half of a century. The more you post hateful comments::: the more you prove only further that Dr. Fauci deserves this award. Turn off the TV. Put on a mask. Grow up.,Did ya’ll attend the seminar::: “How to piss off half of your alumni”?You even admit that he faced public criticism (70 million plus would be a good guess) and you still gave him this honor. Wow!,Proud to be a GT alumna and supportive of the recognition for Dr. Fauci!,Barf. You embarrass our great institution with this joke.,This is terrible. I expect better decisions from Georgia Tech.,All he does is put fear and gloom into our society. He is a joke!,This makes as much sense as tech’s tailgating rule this past season,Georgia Tech honouring a celebrity scientist who is essentially no different than any crooked politician serving special interest groups. This is a disgrace,"Knowing that China has infiltrated so many of our finest institutions and universities...

Disappointed.",I see the MAGA crowd is deciding to troll a college Facebook page since their Twitter finger chief is gone. 🥴 I think this news in phenomenal and well deserved.,This makes me question future donations to my Alma Mater,Can we get an accounting of the funds GT has received from NIAID in the 37 years Dr. Fauci has been overseeing the distribution of billions of our tax dollars?,Apparently Georgia Tech doesn't care about science anymore… Sad day.,Very proud of Georgia Tech for honoring Dr. Fauci in this way...,Great choice by the folks at GT Ivan Allen College! #GoJackets,"I think this is a great choice. He withstood the Trump administrations
denial and constant attempts to lessen the focus on the seriousness. I believe he has tried to tell the truth as he sees it from a scientific standpoint.",Highest paid fedral employee last year. $419680. And he hasn't been right as much as a weatherman,Proud to be a GT alumna and proud of this choice!,Great choice Georgia Tech!,A man who made more wrong predictions than a weather man gets an award for what exactly?,What a shame GT...very disappointing.,Seriously? Do better::: Georgia Tech,As a GT alumnus I would like to say: What a joke.,Don't wear a mask::: wait...wear a mask ... but I won't wear a mask or social distance. Do what I say though - Dr. Fauci,What hummm caved in too the left,What a joke!! Really GT??..,A voice of reason in crazy times. Great choice!,What a well deserved recipient for the award!,Why don’t you just go away. You haven’t made up your mind what we should do in a year. Give the job to some body that knows something and don’t change there mind every week. I am glad you are not my doctor. I would probably be died by now,"Sadly/
ironically::: Georgia Tech is showing little social courage with this pick. “Social courage means not conforming to the expectations of others::: being willing to show your true self even if it means risking social disapproval or punishment. It means being able to express opinions and preferences without checking to see if they are in line with “everyone else's” opinions and preferences.” Objectively speaking::: I don’t see how this choice demonstrates much social courage. He is in a position of authority and his views were in line with the prevailing view. You know who did demonstrate social courage? Dr Li Wenliang::: the Chinese scientist who first spoke out about the virus::: whose view was suppressed and censored::: and who later died from the virus. That is real courage. https://

Poor choice,And the man who::: as head of the NIH gave the lab in Wuhan China $3.5 million to study coronavirus. GREAT JOB DOC!,I’m proud to be a Georgia Tech - Ivan Allen College alum every day::: but I’m especially proud today. Perfect choice!,Seems like a nice guy. But it is easy to be courageous when you are making over $400k as a government bureaucrat. How about awarding someone who has helped in developing the vaccines?,Well deserved. He pursued even with threats to himself and his family. That showed how dedicated he is for us all. Thanks for your perseverance against so many negatives. You are greatly appreciated and respected. Brighter days ahead now finally!🙏,Oh brother. As a Tech Alum::: I feel like this pandering to the Left is shameful. Fauci is a joke.,"This isn’t an airport::: y’all don’t need to announce your departures.

This is a really simple call Tech::: good job honoring a great man 👍

Any of you posters interested in debating “the science” with Dr Fauci::: please understand::: we -really- don’t care about your opinion.",Poor guy looked like he was falling asleep last night on CNN. I hope he is still sleeping this am::: but doubt it. He and other 80 yr olds are working so hard!!,Proud to say he [and Astronaut Jessica Meir from Caribou] get Bowdoin honoraries this Spring!,"Naturally::: the people that had paychecks all of last year give this thing out.

Ignoring ""science"" for a moment-\-\-is public policy now single-attribut
e decision making::: vice MADM? Because last year showed me it is. In engineering we learn TANSTAAFL. We forgot that last year. So have your celebration of the latest ""person who can be used against Republicans""::: a proud tradition for this prize. That still doesn't change the fact that dreams got crushed and people ruined::: as we discovered initial models were way way off in their predictions. You can call it ""courage"". I would call it ""caprice""::: or perhaps ""callousness."" But then::: that is what those who ""followed science"" called others who pointed out that::: yes::: TANSTAAFL.

As for listening to experts...war is too important to be left to the generals. Extrapolate as necessary to other fields. It is either a self-governing republic::: or it isn't::: so one should listen::: sure. And sift.

If one is still allowed to do so.

I submit that those who do so::: who will not be manipulated or stampeded::: are the ones with the real social courage::: not the man who usually had the press wind at his back.","""This annual award honors individuals who have stood up for moral principles at the risk of their careers and livelihoods.

Yay! He got a reward for wanting to take away people’s freedoms.
Sad to see GT give him anything.",Certainly a joke to give anything but a Pinocchio award,Terrible choice. The prize is for social courage. It cost him NOTHING. Courage requires a cost or potential loss. He feared nothing. This is a mistake!,The sad thing is that if Trump hadn't suggested that COVID-19 was a hoax::: there wouldn't be NEARLY as many people outraged over this gesture. Also::: where were these outraged people when others received awards for their efforts in combating other illnesses? What makes those illnesses genuine and Covid-19 a hoax? Is it just because Trump::: who has been to the hospital because of Covid-19::: said so? I pray that these people stop relying on man and instead rely on God.,Just heard that this man is the highest paid Federal Employee::: even more than the president (all federal employees). Think about that. Just a lowly federal employee!!!!!,One criticism: Covid will still be raging in two months::: and Dr Fauci I hope still to busy to travel for a award.,Tied in with Bill gates,I agree. He beat out a highly qualified field that included Dr. John Zoidberg::: Dr. Irwin Corey::: Dr. Drake Ramoray and last but not least Dr. Peter Venkman. I'm shocked the people at Tech could just pick one!!!,As a fellow public servant I can tell you that not many ppl tell their boss like it is! You deserve the gonads award,So being indecisive for 6 months gets you an award now? Welcome to Georgia Tech. 🥴,"The man lied to the American people::: several times::: admitted it in an interview and you want to make him out to be a hero?
Hes nothing more than a lying hypocritical Bureaucrat.",He well deserves it. Rachel sent me an article that he also states that these new variants will not be stopped by the vaccine that I will get tomorrow.,Apparently::: Tech has gone to the dark side. May be time my money went somewhere else.,OMG::: you guys have jumped the shark.,Highest paid government worker in the United States. Made $417:::608.00 dollars in 2019. For what?,This is great for Dr. Fauci and great for Georgia Tech! As recognized leaders in Policy and Science the Ivan Allen College is delivering the right message - Let's uphold those that support Science as part of our public health policy in spite of political groups that choose to not use Science to set such policy. For prospective students that can see through the political smokescreen that is now clouding so much of how COVID is being dealt with::: I hope it makes them want to attend GT and be part of what's going on there.,The truth won't be known for 10 or 20 years ... Evidence points both ways rt now,Proud to see this and to be an Ivan Allen college alumna.,Fauci was giddy to announce to the WHO that the US will pay for overseas abortions. What a social justice warrior.🙄,It's so distressing to see Yellow Jackets who are also idiots (those of you who think this is funny) - what part of Science did you miss while you were there?,How disappointing. There are so many more well-deserving (and less hypocritical and less political) candidates.,Thank you for recognizing him! He's an American hero!!!,The man is a political hack and the policies that he has advocated::: lockdowns and quarantines::: will kill far more than the virus ever would have::: will be generational in impacts.,He just told us to wear two masks at the same time.,Are you kidding! He was inconsistent and lied to the American people:::,And he was wrong and late on virtually every stance he took. Shame that joining the chorus at Tech.,That's cool::: remember a month ago when GT brought Pompeo to campus?,"As he’s know in some circles - Dr Fauxchi

God Bless him for all he has done and way to go GT for choosing him for this award! 💉😷,Is Tech trying to encourage me to stop donating?,What risk did he take?,Very much deserved! Thank you 🐝’s for giving him this recognition,Extremely deserved. Great choice GT!,Dr. Fauci is a slithering politician. Go back 12 months and read his briefs again.,He is very deserving of this honor and many others.,I’m ashamed Ga Tech would award this fool anything. What a joke. He is a complete government clown.

As Covid-19 vaccines arrive in communities around the country::: Georgia Tech biomedical engineers who work with the components of the vaccine are helping to explain how it is made and what makes it safe. The vaccines are made of two primary ingredients: a piece of mRNA and a lipid nanoparticle made from different fats. The mRNA is essentially a set of instructions — that tell our own cells how to kickstart an immune response against Covid-19. Because our body would not react well to just plain mRNA::: the lipid nanoparticle carries the instructions to the cells. -- http://c.gatech.edu/2LKggY4,2021-01-21 12:26:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I apologized::: took my seat::: opened my 3-ring binder to take notes::: and saw my class schedule::: where it was plainly marked that my English class began at 0900. Oops. I'd had English at 0800 every previous quarter::: and this particular prof had a section at both 0800 and 0900 in the same classrom. So::: when she dismissed the class after the whistle blew::: she went to change her attendance record in her notebook::: looked at me::: and asked::: ""What are YOU doing here?""

I didn’t realize that they were ever given out.,The exploitation and discrimination against international graduate students as cheap labour in Georgia Tech is shameful. The lack of student unions and the institute’s opposition of student unions and all the coverups of corrupt professors is disgusting. Corruption stories of Georgia tech’s leadership is sickening.

In 1979::: Georgia Tech biology student Richie Bland drove from campus to Six Flags Over Georgia::: where he had a 25-pound foam and rubber Yellow Jacket costume made — based on an insect body design he'd drawn on a napkin. During the Florida game that season::: Bland hid the costume in a janitor’s closet and changed into it during halftime. He ran past security and onto the field – and that’s the story of how Buzz became Georgia Tech’s official mascot.,2020-10-15 15:00:00,Love Buzz 🐝 Awesome story 🐝,After Clemson destroyed them Saturday::: they may need to get a whole hive for next year.,I learned in genetics that Buzz is female. Total trivia::: but the class seemed initially perplexed by the idea.,Steven Branch,Ashley Moore 😃,I knew him! What a character!,I was at that game. I was a freshman. Didn't know it was his first time.,Julie DeAngelo Smith & Josh Smith::: I did not know this 🐝,"Have you heard the news? Get ready for this. We're going to #CANCELALLSTUDEN

Because of the coronavirus pandemic::: it was not known if Georgia Tech would be able to have the Ramblin’ Wreck lead the football team onto the field at Bobby Dodd.

"A group of first-year Georgia Tech students in Fitten Hall got together to surprise their custodian::: Valerie::: by decorating her door. As the pictures and video were shared on social media and group chats::: other floors started doing the same thing. Valerie said no one had ever done anything like that for her before.

Today::: on Labor Day::: we thank the essential workers who've kept campus operating during these incredibly challenging circumstances. You are so important in making Georgia Tech the world-class institution that it is — and you are very much appreciated! -- https://c.gatech.edu/3bBhP31",2020-09-07 16:08:00,"PAG KAKITAAN ONLINE NO OVEN SPANISH BREAD

Four others on that UT team became SEC head coaches.,THWG......and Clemson::: too!,"What are they going to do with all that water now that the field is artificial? (For those who don't know::: a few years back during drought/
watering ban they found an extraneous pipe with no records under the SW corner of the stadium. Turns out we have been piping a spring (it's not called Spring St. for nothing) into ATL sewers for the last x years. So they built a cistern under the stands to collect the water and have been using it to water the field for free.)",1959 Tech vs Auburn in the pouring rain.

As a result of strategic recruitment::: Georgia Tech’s new class of students has increased in-state enrollment as well as the number of transfer::: first-generation::: and underrepresented minority students. Students in this class come from 104 of Georgia’s 159 counties and from 49 of the 50 states. (See you soon::: Alaska!) -- https://c.gatech.edu/2EOkhqo,2020-08-31 14:43:00,I am interested in artificial intelligence,Alaska’s always holding up the works.,"Wow GT very cool. We don’t discriminate over here #COVIDforall

Why was your minority representation this low to begin with in Atlanta?

How many cases/day before you #shutitdown?

LOOK UP “GT CORVIAS”. THEY PUT STUDENTS AT RISK FOR MONETARY REASONS. THEY WERE WARNED::: NOW THEYRE TRYING TO BLAME STUDENTS.",For those curious folks. The acceptance rate for male out of state is about 9%. Out of state female about 16%. Total applicants for 2024 class was over 42K. Huge increase in applications. I believe the admit rate all up average is now around 18%? Not sure. But lower than the 22% for class of 2023. Please correct me if I am way off 😊,LORD Jesus Christ🌍🌍🙏🙏💓💓⛪⛪,LORD Jesus Christ🌍🌍🙏🙏💓💓⛪⛪,LORD Jesus Christ🌍🌍🙏🙏💓💓⛪⛪,Glad these posts turned positive. It was getting off to a rocky start. My son attends and we are from Missouri. He wasn't challenged in high school and can finally be pushed and ultimately do great things. I'm glad to see they pull from out of state. Pull the best::: not only those in a 100 mile radius,The key is to graduate!,Glad to hear it. Keep it up.,My Alma Mater should be spending the resources of the state of Georgia on educating people who will increase the prosperity of the state of Georgia. That is why this country has state universities as well as private universities. The state universities are there to benefit the States.,Welcome the our newest GT family,What’s wrong w those 55 counties that they couldn’t get 1 student into the premier in-state school in GA?,I don’t know if now is a really good time to brag about how you brought a large group of people from a large number of places together in a confined area during a pandemic,"What is ""strategic recruitment""? My alma mater is not bowing to political pressure to reduce international enrollment::: is it?",What is percentage of instate vs out of state? What is percentage of international?,A cliche::: but....a dream come true for my daughter who was eyeing GT since middle school. She learned about the school from her Math Teacher/ MathCounts Adviser::: who is an alumnus.,Great school. A privilege to study in GT.❤️,"Congratulations

"In the 1940s::: Georgia Tech students took in a speckled terrier after she was thrown from a car window in Atlanta. After several surgeries::: her head and tail weren’t quite aligned and she walked with a limp::: hence her name: Sideways.

She attended classes::: ate table scraps at Brittain Dining Hall::: and even led our ROTC and football team onto the field at Bobby Dodd Stadium. She died in 1947 and is buried near Tech Tower.
Sideways' original straight headstone was replaced by a slanted one to remember her forever as she was. To this day::: Yellow Jackets leave a penny for Sideways at her grave::: hoping for a little luck on exams and the new school year. #NationalDogDay",2020-08-26 16:06:00,Loved reading this. 👍😊,Thanks for this neat story.

"It is critically important that our entire community take part in our on-campus testing program once a week. To show you how simple and easy it is::: we are taking you through the entire process::: step by step::: using 360º degree camera technology so you can see the test from beginning to end at our Bobby Dodd Stadium testing site.

If you are viewing on a smartphone::: move your phone in various directions for the full effect. On desktop::: use your mouse to move the video around in all directions. For our on-campus community::: register for your weekly test at mytest.gatech.edu.

HELP.FACEBOOK.COM
360 Video is not yet available for this device.",2020-08-24 16:46:52,Need to adjust camera so we can see the kit and what you are doing. Would you consider partnering with County of Hawaii on the Island of Hawaii to introduce this easy and quick testing?,Are you testing the wastewater from the residence halls to prevent outbreaks?,I'm on campus at the moment and I cannot understand why testing isn't mandatory. I couldn't care less about the five dollar gift cards or popsicles::: I care about not getting sent home in a chaotic mess. Just mandate weekly testing. This is not difficult. Many other colleges are doing it.,Most all will get it w eventually!,Why are students on campus to begin with? 🤔,Progress and service 😷🐝🌈,I’m sorry::: you want infected students to have to leave their dorms to get tested? Why not distribute tests to all dorms and then have them systematically picked up? That seems a lot more effective given that there is a literal outbreak on campus. Or here’s a good one! Put the whole campus on quarantine for 10-14 days::: have them test again and everyone who is negative an go home and anyone who is positive can stay and quarantine until their negative so they don’t go home and infect their family. Clearly this outbreak can not be controlled and to suggest otherwise is extremely misleading. To continue to attempt to “control” the virus and stay open is quite literally putting lives in danger.,Are statistics available to compare the accuracy of the saliva test to the deep nasal swab?,Looks like an easy and quick process. I am glad that GT went with saliva testing vs. nasal which helps make the process so much easier & painless. Thought not a quick test at least Tech is processing in 2 days. Much better than many who usually take 5 days.,Super easy to do.,My Jacket is doing her part♥️🐝,"You're at GT. You can do this! UGA not so much. https://

Upon move-in::: every Georgia Tech student received a wellness kit with a reusable face mask::: hand sanitizer::: a device to avoid touching door handles and buttons::: and a thermometer. The Student Government Association has been distributing additional face coverings::: sanitizer::: and information about testing and contact tracing on campus. — https://b.gatech.edu/31UGDyi,2020-08-14 19:48:33,While I wholly support GT reopening I am very trepidatious. Dropped our son off today in his apartment dorm at North Ave. His roommates::: one of whom is the RA for the floor::: came over to our son to shake hands and welcome him - without masks. Our son accepted their welcome and then went into his room and used some hand sanitizer.,I am not a student and would absolutely buy one.,What about those that commute? They are still a part of the GT community::: they should receive this as well!,THANK YOU G.T. FOR BEING CONCERNED ENOUGH TO PROTECT ALL CHILDREN !!,Would like to buy this kit. Is it available online?,So cute! Thank you for giving to our students!🐝🐝,These should’ve been provided to all students::: not just freshman. The PPE kit stations were a nice touch::: but the kit itself is honestly disappointing and the masks provided are too big::: which is a grave issue.,What about students that moved in to apartments? How do they get these packages? I know kids that moved into frats that did not get this. My daughter stopped at one of the locations and all she got was a plain black mask::: hand sanitizer in a zip lock bag.,The picture is quite misleading. It is not the same kit I received from the school few days ago.,The care package I picked up from campus today was not this nice. GT only providing these nice ones to those in dorms. Leaving it to SGA to pass out kits to everyone (that are less nice::: but still appreciated),This ALUM wants to purchase one of these to bring with her to work at her local Brevard FL school on the SPACE COAST! #steminist,Be safe be healthy.. good luck to all students at GT,I want to buy one. Let me know.,"Love this! Praying this year at Tech still provides connection for all the new students...in spite of covid.
My son is a senior this year@Tech. 🐝",What if the student is living off-campus? How do they acquire one?,"Now that’s top drawer. 👍
Way to go SGA! 👍👏🏻👏🏻",Thank you so much for a really smooth move in yesterday at Crecine,Anyway to get the kit shipped? I’m taking classes remotely and would love one!,All I got was a handshake and a bad attitude,Anyway non student can purchase this?!? Looks awesome!,Ooh definitely going to pick some up,Cost per student- included in tuition?,Thank you so much for the wellness kit. Very nice surprise! Btw today we moved in my son and everything went great. He loves his new place: North Ave - North 🐝,Where do you get the thermometer my daughter moved in her sorority house and does not know to pick it up,Can online student get the same kit?,Why are other students not receiving this?,Where do moved-in students go to get one if they weren’t given one?,I'd like to buy one!,Looks like 50 grand was worth it.,I’d like a kit for my GT eLearning student.,I want one! I am not a student or alumni just a DIE HARD GT FAN!!!!!!!!!!!!,Thank you for all you are doing for your students.,Thanks::: Tech! 🐝,A nice suprise for our daughter when she moved in today!,Thank you. My daughter who is a Senior this year is flying in as I am texting. It is good to know you are putting your plans to practice. Go GT,Will students living in sorority houses and fraternity houses also receive these? I should hope so as they pay the same fees as students in dorms.,im self quarantine after my flight and only can come to campus after 24th August::: am I still able to get it?,Please sell these::: students who live off campus will need them too.,Can alumni buy the GT reusable mask?,My dad graduated from Georgia Tech would love to have one!,How can I get one?,For students residing off campus too?,Way to be smart and responsible!❤️🐝’s!,Are the kits for sale online or at the bookstore?,Love the door handle/ button device!!,Love the doorhandle device. Good luck to everyone.,This is amazing. Welcome newest Yellow Jackets! Sting 'em! 🐝,You know I bet alumni would buy these too....,Cool. Do they sell these,Thanks for sharing.

"We know Covid-19 testing and notification will play a large role in keeping our community safe. While the final details are being put in place::: we wanted to give you the information we have now. More details will be provided before the start of classes.

Y’all are doing a great job taking steps to keep us safe!,So many parents seem worried::: why don't you just have your kids stay home for a semester or two?,Everything that Tech put here is regarding students::: what about the faculty and staff? Are we going to be tested or is only required if we have symptoms?,Is it voluntary who tests? Or some minimum standard?,"These are some good steps but there are some obvious gaps. Much more needs to be done to ensure that Georgia Tech doesn’t become part of the problem of rapidly increasing cases::: hospitalization
s and deaths here in Georgia.","If a student has to isolate/

Will you be providing students with a choice as to whether or not we have to attend classes in person? Currently we are being told we have to attend our in person sessions for hybrid courses despite all classes being required to deliver both in person and online modes to provide access to all students. If students are not comfortable with returning to campus::: which is in a COVID-19 hotspot::: we should not have to. How do you plan to address and resolve this issue?

Also on the note of personal hygiene::: which is mentioned in your video::: how do you plan to combat the high population of students on campus that do not wash their hands after using the bathroom? I’ve witnessed it not only in my community style housing as a first year::: but out in public::: student-shared spaces. Does this not pose a large issue not only in relation to COVID-19::: but also on general student health?

Also::: how do you plan to keep campus reasonably quarantined? Students consistently go off campus during the week and on weekends to find fun things to do. Does this not pose a threat to maintaining a safe COVID free environment for students? Even if they wear a mask::: do not forget that COVID lives on surfaces and can be transferred by touching things. How do you plan to address student outings into Atlanta and surrounding areas? How do you plan to address large gatherings?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Just saying. . .,Great job,How can mask wearing be enforced if there are still students who don’t want to wear one?,That’s a horrible policy brought about because FACULTY were so uninformed and afraid that they pushed for this failed policy! Asymptomatic spread is very rare! And it’s rarely affecting college age students! Students need fresh air::: not faculty and administrators harassing them about wearing a stupid mask!

..From khalifa of Allah over the worlds to Xi Jinping president of China
🌷🇨🇳👇🇨🇳👇🇨🇳👇🇨🇳🌷.
Allah’s hidden soldiers are still launching their global war continuing night and day for twenty-four hours without rest::: and it does not get weak::: surely it is from His hidden soldiers::: unseen with the naked eye for its small size::: and it's what you call it coronavirus::: yet it is not a corona::: only has deceived them initially the outer form has similarity with the known viruses that they have previously of which they know::: but it’s genes and its behavior is different altogether::: but its first name corona as they thought initially is being issued in the entire means of media and by the tongues (languages) of the world; [Corona] although it is completely different than the entire viruses::: and only got similar with it formerly initially yet it differed genetically. In fact; by Allah Who there is no God other than Him::: the One::: the Subduer::: indeed it is a living organism broken apart and been split::: yet what’s coming next is calamitous::: most bitter and a wide spread evil::: and the entire physicians of humans will turn their backs (fleeing).

And it is a living organism new for humans and breaking the entire scientific medical physics::: and it will indeed make humans’ science about what concerns scientific medical physics (0) zero at the left for the fact they originally do not compass knowledge about it.

But the upcoming strong virus is the most powerful and the strongest impact in chastisement lo and behold they will despair from it::: and it is not only at the level of the respiratory system::: in fact there is no room for a comparison between covid 19 viruses and the upcoming strong virus — O Xi Jinping president of China — O who claim that they controlled chastisement of Allah Lord of the world::: glory be to Him the Exalted most High beyond measure::: yet they know that they are indeed liars

I announce to the atheists in china and criminal leaders of humans of their ilk altogether::: and the entire unjust mischief makers::: — a new species of viruses which is the strong striking virus worst of the viruses and the most impact and the strongest in sabotaging; in fact there is no room for a comparison between it and what you call it covid 19::: it is the one that the scientists of medicine will turn their backs in flight from it and the army of physicians of humans would not return back::: being defeated from their forefathers then the global health organization would collapse their high structure is being vacant and they could never avail a thing away from you from Allah’s chastisement. In fact::: by no means and they could never be able to help you nor help themselves.

Verily::: listen::: comprehend and understand to what I will say to you: Indeed::: there is a Great Leader for these recent viruses you are not of His proportion nor you are equivalent to Him and His tiniest soldiers receive orders directly by revelations from Allah::: so they would do what they are commanded from source of operations for the Highest Leader::: that is your Most High Lord in the kingdom — reveals directly to His tiny soldiers what to do so they would do what they are commanded and He is with it by words of His absolute-abilit
y — glory be to him::: that is Allah Lord of the worlds that you violate His sanctity (denying His existence) — O Xi Jinping the Chinese president who declared war against Allah::: His religion::: His Quran and the Muslim Chinese openly (in broad) daylight against the Muslims in China and shut-down Allah’s Houses (of worship) in China. In fact::: he prohibited the Muslims to even pray in their houses and took Allah’s Book the grand Quran and burned Allah’s Book the grand Quran as transgression and oppression.

You must listen and comprehend what will I say it with Truth: O you the Chinese president Xi Jinping::: I swear by Allah the Great::: surely you will open houses of Allah while you are of the humiliated-trif
le ones also the entire those who wronged themselves that shut-down Allah’s houses (of worship) with the pretense of prevention they will definitely open it and to it they will escape::: and we surely truthful::: and you surely will know.

Anyway::: — O community of best foremost supporters from various regions::: let the focus be accomplished exclusively on publishing three explanatory-sta
tements at the first level::: the explanatory-sta
tement that we wrote it by its title that follows: (Coronavirus and the decisive explanatory-sta
tement::: and it is not a joke..)::: title of the explanatory-sta
tement has ended. You must know the sure knowledge that there is in it a healing to what’s in the chests::: guidance::: and mercy for the believers. And peace be upon the messengers::: and praise be to Allah Lord of the worlds.

Bad city management for sure.,"There's not a city in the U.S. that doesn't have similar aging pipes and underground infrastructure.
The problem (as it was explained to me) is that the city has no clear idea where much of it is. Records have been lost or misplaced over many decades::: property lines have been redrawn::: and new stuff has been built on top of the old stuff.

And so everyone adopts a policy of ""use it until it breaks""::: and then move in to aggressively repair and replace it.","Our politics make it difficult to invest in upgrading and maintenance of infrastructure:::
especially infrastructure you can't see. Former mayor Shirley Franklin deserves great credit for the work she did to fix water and sewer problems.",Tom Siracusa,WOW !!!

Nice work::: everyone.,"Yay! Science and Sense for the win! ✅
Now how can we help the public school system do more to protect faculty and staff?!",In my mind::: any responsible education institution would already have a contingency plan with 100% online teaching if infection surges exponentially. It must be ever-ready to avoid disruption. With the campus re-opening it is almost certain that this scenario will materialise because of the congregations (even with masks required). So why not avoid it all together by making online teaching the default mode?,Why so difficult to make it 100% online in fall?,For anyone who thinks that their young healthy student can’t get very sick from COVID please read this post from an 18 year old gymnast is my city. Masks are a simple thing to do for each other and also a reminder to be more cautious during this pandemic. Imagine your student missing two::: three::: four or more weeks of GA Tech courses. Hoping for online options in addition the masks especially for huge lecture only courses.,Thank you to all the faculty to who worked together to make this happen!! Truly appreciated!!,"This has more to do with legal issues than actual health. Studies have shown all-day mask wearing is inefficeient for preventing disease spread. Part of that is because people do not wear the masks properly or reach under them to scratch or have to take them off to drink::: eat::: spit gum out::: etc and still transfer germs only now they are inside not outside the mask and being continually held in contact with your respiratory system. Combining social distancing::: hand washing::: limited exposure inside with groups has been shown to limit or slow down the spread::: not prevent it. The type of mask also makes a difference::: but again::: most people do not properly wear masks and are lulled into thinking they do not have to social distance or sanitize their hands after touching any surface before touching their face or rubbing their eyes.
To be fair::: online classes should be offered to those who are imuno-compromis
ed. This works for math and English classes::: not so much for mechanics and lab classes though. Students::: staff and faculty are still being placed at risk and experimenting with masks when studies clearly indicate they are not longterm protection against disease spread is not the smartest choice to make.",why not immediately effective? why waiting till next week? and in the meantime ? free to get ill? nonsense ...,Thank you Tech for leading the way!,How does this affect the CRC?,Right thing to do. Thank you.,"My work place thought the same thing and today we sent everybody home because employees were testing positive.
.Masks were optional.",Thank you for using common sense to protect all university staff members::: immune compromised students and parents !,As the mom of an immune compromised son who will be a third year student::: I really appreciate the concern of the Tech community. Sometimes one has to take a step back and realize it’s not just about ‘you’. A successful community acknowledges its diversity and hopefully commits to looking out for and supporting one another. My son’s life may not be important to a stranger::: but it is important to me. He has loved his Tech experience so far and I hope with a little compassion::: we can learn to get through this together and eventually pull through stronger on the other side.,Georgia Tech I am glad that masks are mandatory now. You redeemed yourself! Welcome back to the land of reason and science.‬,Thank you so much for posting this. This is very comforting since my granddaughter will be attending Georgia Tech as a Freshman this year. Knowing she has such caring and responsible faculty willing to stand up for her health and well being is very comforting and appreciated.,Good idea...make it a statewide thing,Very glad to hear of this revision. Thank u all who made some noise and stood up for this change!,Thank you! Both my GT student and I appreciate this decision!,How does this differ from the regulations today? I hear that this is just different wording but what is already in place.,Here’s a mask for the sheep out there that don’t understand biology!,Thank you for taking this action.,So proud of our faculty!,Well::: duh. Cannot believe you were set on not requiring masks. Tech is way smarter than that.,Thank you for using common sense to protect our children,Glad USG came around,It is really necessary to take online course rather than making the students and faculties into high risky environment. We have already lost too many innocent people because of the bad leadership.,The correct decision,Thank you to the courageous Georgia Tech faculty who moved this issue along. Trailblazers!,Thank you for making this change!,If you have serious concerns about the health and safety of students::: then just cancel Fall semester.,good job! safety comes first!,Looks like we can make smart decisions after all. Good job advocating!!,Right move but make it mandatory 6 feet or not,Easiest way to make social distancing possible would be to make fall an entirely virtual semester.,Good but we need a board that will do things the right way without needing bad press to shame them into it.,Good job! Pity that it had to hit CNN for the board of regents to see sense.,Great job::: need for everyone’s safety!,So does this mean students always have to wear masks inside::: or only when social distancing isn't possible?,Thank you from a facility staff,Thank you for making the right choice!,Thank you! 👏 Your staff and faculty appreciate it!,Can you outline what steps will be done for on-campus housing? All those people using one bathroom...,Great job advocating to protect all.,What about outside campus buildings? There are still large crowds around campus.,So... does this apply to dorm rooms?,Thanks GT for being leader on this issue hope other universities follow your lead.,That’s very disappointing that students don’t have the freedom to breathe fresh air! I would highly recommend that students peacefully resist this tyranny and demand the freedom to look after their own health! Certainly::: Tech should have the resources to fight this tyranny in court!,In other words::: people who are incapable of wearing masks because of health issues like asthma and chronic headaches are to risk their health or be discriminated against.,"In Georgia::: Governor Kemp ended the stay-at-home order on May 1st. Since then:

- the 7-day moving average of cases has gone from 679 to 1682::: a 147% increase.
- the 7-day moving average of deaths has gone from 42 to 15::: a 64% decrease.

It takes a median duration of 18.5 days from infection to die of Covid-19. We should have been seeing deaths increase since about May 19th. We have seen 66 days of decreasing deaths.

At this time::: there is zero evidence of a second wave of deaths here in Georgia::: despite the increase in cases.

Today::: we’re sharing our plan to safely return to campus this fall. The plan includes changes to the calendar and course delivery::: strengthened health and safety protocols::: and a set of personal hygiene practices for all of us. Our goal is to bring our campus community back together and move forward safely::: responsibly::: and compassionately in pursuit of our important educational and research work while prioritizing everyone’s health and safety. Key among the many preventive measures will be a commitment by each one of us to maintain a safe physical distance from one another and to use facial coverings whenever distancing may not be feasible. And for students::: faculty::: and staff who might be at higher risk of contracting Covid-19::: we will establish alternative arrangements. The information on the link below will give you an overview of what our return to campus will look like::: what changes to expect::: what precautions we will take to keep our community safe::: and what you will need to do to help everyone enjoy a healthy and productive semester. Please note that there are still details to be worked out and some of our current protocols are subject to change as more information becomes available over the coming weeks. Our commitment is to share any additions and changes as soon as possible. Full plan: http://health.gatech.edu/tech-moving-forward,2020-06-16 22:05:33,"https://

On June 1::: 2020::: Officer James Cornacchia of the Georgia Tech Police Department (GTPD) lost his battle with Covid-19.

Officer Cornacchia was last on campus May 12::: and he did not develop symptoms within 48 hours of that day. Out of an abundance of caution::: all GTPD officers have been tested for Covid-19. Each of those tests came back negative. Georgia Tech continues to strictly follow guidance from the Georgia Department of Public Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

A lukewarm statement that you stand in solidarity with the Black community (of the university that you are the voice for) is less than the minimum effort you could make.

The student body is currently over 50% minority. How are their tuition dollars going towards protecting them from police brutality and fighting systemic racism?

How much is GT planning to donate towards causes fighting for racial justice? What steps are you taking to help students healing from trauma? Please respond with actions you are taking::: not a note of thoughts and prayers.",Silence from President Cabrera is Violence,"As a GT alum::: I’m embarrassed by this vague::: milquetoast statement. It has a strong “thoughts and prayers” energy in part because it doesn’t specifically mention any individuals::: teams::: or even defined plans being put in place as a response to the murders you’re ostensibly addressing.

At one point::: President Cabrera::: you literally say “...we demand change from those with the power to enact it...” That’s you. You have the power. And yet you follow that statement by making absolutely no mention of GT’s relationship with APD. This is not an opportunity for you to get some press about some ill-defined inclusion initiatives you kicked off a few months ago. You started your statement talking about George and Breonna and Ahmaud. Why do none of the solutions you offer have anything to do with the police?

What IS GT’s relationship with APD? How much of the money your Black students pay in tuition each year gets funneled into an institution that’s proven lethal to Black bodies?

Also::: how dare you use students that you’re educating to “think critically about the society we live in” in order to “lead us to a better place” as an example of your response to this moment? You are the president. You are the adult. How could you even consider shifting responsibility to teenagers?

Where is this “leadership” you keep talking about::: President Cabrera? I don’t see it. Do better.","As a Georgia Tech alumni::: I will say that standing in solidarity is not enough.

When I went to Georgia Tech::: the ratio was 2 men to 1 woman and ""underrepresent
ed minorities"" (no distinction of race) was under 15% of the entire student body.

The brilliant Black students at Georgia Tech have the lowest acceptance rates and lowest graduation rates. Keep in mind::: Atlanta is a majority Black & African American city. Let me be clear::: this is NOT for lack of genius.

As one of the most affordable::: highest ROI public universities out there::: I will ask you again Georgia Institute of Technology::: WHAT are you DOING to support Black lives?

The data says that it is not enough.",But let’s not forget what mattered last week::: and now the rioters have put our most vulnerable citizens at greater risk because the national guard has to redirect their efforts...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Georgia Tech engineers have been working with NASA - National Aeronautics and Space Administration to make sure robots exploring other planets can avoid getting stuck like the Spirit rover that caught on Mars a decade ago. This planetary rover concept was 3D printed on Tech's campus has a special way to avoid getting stuck in sandy terrains. It can lift and wiggle its legs and wheels to get out of a tricky situation::: and engineers tested it in a giant vat of poppy seeds. -- https://c.gatech.edu/3cEzRRw,2020-05-16 16:59:04,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here's an interesting nugget of information: Georgia Tech's Student Center was home to the first Chick-Fil-A franchise on any college campus in America. -- https://c.gatech.edu/2Anp9ka,2020-05-12 18:56:37,That was after my time. Wished they had been there when I was a student there.,Have great memories of enjoying a chicken biscuit before classes.,I hope they maintain their Tradition of nurturing bodily and Spiritually::: and not cave into any ungodliness::: for the Founders put God First. 👏,The best fast food place by a mile. They obviously do an excellent job hiring::: training and supervising their employees. Every time I eat at one of their restaurants I am highly impressed with their efficiency and the attitude of the staff. They actually act like they enjoy serving you.,I have eaten there many times.. 😁,Chick-Fil-A was my favorite place for years at GT.,"Nothing to be proud of there. Horrible owners that cheat their employees out of benefits under the guise of Religious objection.

Pigs.",I remember when it opened!,I remember that day. One of the first in line.,Hahaha *nugget* - thanks Steven!,I wish it wasn’t there!,Mark Tyson::: Vance Tyson,The student center also had one of the first ATMs in the country-she had a name-“Tilly the Teller” and sang a song when you pressed one of the buttons.,I remember when it opened too and I was a student there! We got free chicken nuggets when it first opened!,GT always so smart 😁,Julian Nirmal,Bill Stewart,I miss the days of playing Tekken Tag and Time Crisis at the student center arcade after classes.,It was a big deal when it opened in 1992.,Bring back Junior’s:(,Andrew Travis,I ate there a lot!,I love(d) Chick-Fil-A but can’t bring myself to eat there anymore. Sad,Gwen 😎,Yalini Senthil Kumar iconic,Jeff Ostrow,Now I feel old lol,Summer quarter tradition for me and Jason Rexroat...picked up a chicken biscuit::: then went bowling w/some Alpha Xi's for our required PE credit. Could life get any easier?!,The student center was also the only Pizza-Hut (a PepsiCo co.) that sold Coke,Olivia Armstrong,And I was there to enjoy it while in school!,I remember when it opened::: it was so exciting.... But my fav was the taco salads made across from Chick-fil-A... Yum! Also remember going to the original dwarf house in Hapeville::: walking in through the dwarf door and being forced to eat a hot brown with no utensils. Good times.,Jamie Salinger,Thomas Pass Hannah Wells 😁 #gojackets,Chris Walton ooo,Not a surprise since the first Chik-Fil-A was in Hapeville and their HQ is in College Park,Iván A. López Martínez,and I couldn't wait for that chicken biscuit on my way to class Monday mornings,"I was an undergrad when it opened in the student center cafeteria in 1992 or so. For years prior::: the student center cafeteria had a grill where you could get a burger/
cheeseburger/or chicken sandwich. A gentleman named Larry worked the grill most days. If you wanted a chicken sandwich::: you told Larry that you wanted a ""Chick-fil-a"".",I remember when it opened.

It could be FBI ""Counterintelli
gence Division 5"" or some other branch of the government with tech. help from CIA or NSA. Masers are frequency weapons that use ""extremely low-frequency electromagnetic
waves:::"" ""ELF's;"" to interface with the neuronal clusters in the brain::: to translate them into cybernetic analogs of conscious and subconscious neurosynaptic communication. By this means the entire concious and subconscious contents of a person's mind and psyche::: can be uploaded and downloaded into a computer and sent back into the subject's brain. The mind control aspects of this are obvious::: in that dream sequences::: messages::: and hallucinations can be entrained into the person's mind to program them::: or ""ELF""'s"" can be used to saturate the peritol lobe and create auditory hallucinations:::
or ""Psychic Driving"" to drive somebody insane with repetitions of
sentences and messages that go on all day as a form of torture. Also possible via ELF's is being able to molecularly change the bio or neuro-chemistry
of the blood to a blood volume of lets say 15%::: to a drug by changing the blood molecules to the molecules of that drug::: and then change the drug molecules back to blood molecules::: therein ""cleaning"" the drug out of the body. People can be poisoned this way::: drugged::: or have needed medicines taken out of their blood. Torture with ""Psychic Driving"" via ELF's repeating the same phrases or music 'over-and-over'
can also be done with microwaves that impinge on the auditory nerves to create ""audiograms"" that can be heard just as audibly inside the head as the ""psychic driving"" torture via ""ELF""'s. Also infrasound at low vibrational densities can program the psyche via bio-morphic communications via cellular memory and manipulate emotional structures. The psyche can be emotionally programmed in this way::: negative and painful emotio
ns entrained in a subject/
victim at will::: and other uses of evoking various emotions for mind control purposes. You can partition the brain synapses with ELF's like partitioning a computer::: and program subdivisions of the brain::: and at the same time create subdivisions of the psyche: ""Multiple Personalities"" with biomorphic programming with low infrasound::: and then use high infrasound to program the amnesiac barriers between ""alter personalities"" with ""crypto-hypotic code:::"" to regulate ""alter"" functioning as well as keep people from using hypnosis to get into the ""alter systems"" of the programmed person. Also infrasound and microwaves at thermal levels can torture people at the high level::: by hitting nerves in the body where it can feel like your body and/or eyes are being cut with knives::: or low infrasound and microwaves at thermal levels will cause sensations of burning or burn the skin. Also the Catholic Church is involved in all of this::: and is misusing maser techology o
n kids for purposes of exploitation::: (of which the media has stories in abundance and also the reasons why the Catholic Church has paid out millions to victims of clergy abuse) and also the Catholic Church is involved in the punative aspects of this program in the USA to punish political dissidents. (Redacted) are involved in this. They have been maser torturing me for almost a year::: and identified themselves to me via 'synthetic telepathy' as a licensing requirement. This misuse of masers on domestic populations for purposes of programming and torture is an egregious violation of human rights and must be ended. For me and others::: I hope it is ended soon.

!","Congratulations
! Go Jackets!",Carson Bliss,"This is a wonderful sea change from my days there (1959-1970). At that time the campus was poisonously conservative::: and they had very few women. The physics department would not accept women graduate students::: and the fraternities published a racist underground paper called the Techlique. I know of one fraternity that hosted a ""Pig Party"". They went to poor parts of town and invited women to a fraternity party. They gathered in a parking lot and had staged a bandstand with a group that they called the ""Orange Orgasms"". In the middle of the party::: on a signal::: they all disappeared::: leaving the women stranded. I know this because I went to High School with one of the organizers. My Alma Mater has come a long way. Unfortunately::: the undercurrents of bigotry and racism are still in the background.","Congratulations
Jackets - Another honor for Georgia Tech. I was an administrator there for many years and still fee great pride in their accomplishments

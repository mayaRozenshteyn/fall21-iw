She was Hoch::: complete with lightening bolts and flames and the rest of us were fire fighters 😂,I took a general anthropology class there in the late '60s. Hundreds of students and the professor's TAs took role from a seating chart. If you were in the wrong seat::: you were absent.,I registered at Hoch back in the day when we enrolled at Allen.

I was a kid when it burned::: but I did get to attend some events in there. It would still be a favorite classroom if it was standing today. I saw the lightning strike from about 10 miles away. I knew that it had hit something.,It’ll always be Hoch Auditorium to me.

A KU professor’s new book::: “Drug Lords::: Cowboys and Desperados: Violent Myths of the U.S.-Mexico Frontier:::” says good-versus-evil tropes — such as white-hatted cowboys or vicious drug lords —have led to real-life oppression of ethnic minorities.  NEWS.KU.EDU Deconstructing Western myths,2021-08-12 19:42:02,"GIVE ME a BREAK! The author insinuates that the only reason why Ronald Reagan got elected President of the United States is because he was a cowboy actor. The issue I have with that is that he stopped acting about twenty years before he took office. In fact::: he had been the governor of California before being elected POTUS::: and had served more than one term as such::: he had strong political background. Moreover::: his POTUS predecessor was none other than Jimmy Carter::: whose anemic economic policies and noncommittal response to the Iranian hostage crisis were both seen as his political downfall. In addition::: inflation::: a stagnant economy and weakness of Carter's policies paved the way for Reagan to be elected into office- *NOT* whether or not he wore a cowboy hat. Reagan ran for president a total of three times- in 1968::: 1976::: and a third time in 1980. If his cowboy image had ANY BEARING in his election AT *ALL!*::: he would have won the first time. Therefore::: the author's stance is factually wrong. Reagan was a Republican. Jimmy Carter was a Democrat. Ronald Reagan promised economic prosperity and a reduction of government as well as the reduction of ""inflation""::: two policies which he delivered on. His hatlessness::: at the time::: was not a problem. Jimmy Carter was seen at the time as being one of the weakest presidents in the previous fifty years::: which is why he got bounced after only FOUR years. He also attempts to convey the idea that El Chapo Guzman is ""vilified"" and misunderstood::: essentially because of his skin color. No::: I thank you-the man is villified because he sells illegal narcotics and murders people; he's not a ""Hispanic Jesus"".  I do hope this is satire; his ideas about Reagan elicited more than a few guffaws.  Let's stick to what the facts ARE::: not what we WANT them to BE just so we can publish.",I would expect nothing less from a KU professor.,MG,these people can turn anything into a racist rant.,Disgusting Marxist propaganda.

Kendi will give Self Graduate Fellowship Symposium Lecture,2021-07-19 16:25:16,I guess all these haters in the comments want to cancel him and want censorship after all. 🤔 What happened to the marketplace of ideas and the First Amendment?,If you have ever heard him speak::: he is an intelligent::: well spoken and thoughtful person. I am surprised by the hateful comments.,I’m stunned by those making negative comments about this event and the author. I have to ask::: if you’re posting negative comments::: have you read his book?,Many conservatives speak at KU on a regular basis::: maybe just not at this specific graduate-level fellowship symposium for this year. A guest lecturer for a symposium like this is going to be a leading academic in their field—not some political commentator with lots of opinions. That’s why Kendi was invited.,Bring him::: and let him discuss his ideas. Then bring opposing viewpoints to campus::: and let them discuss their ideas without protest. Dr. Ben Carson comes to mind::: or Ben Shapiro.  Let the opposing viewpoints speak openly and honestly in the marketplace of ideas.  CRT is merely a tool to further the marxist agenda::: using race rather than class::: to divide and conquer.

I have been extremely fortunate or perhaps erudite in my lifetime so am leaving enough to money to other institutions to fund a couple of chairs. The KU Administration is leaving millions on the table for unbalanced political approach to education…,A lecture based on finger pointing. Should be enlightening.,"More accurately should be titled ""how to be a racist bigot & how to get a pass from the racist leftist media??""",I’m embarrassed that my alma mater would pay money to hear the racist vitriol of this fraud. What a joke.,Well that should make the Legislature feel good about sending funds to KU,Rachel !!!,No more donations to KU. This man is an avowed racist who’s goal is racial tension. How will he make money if there is actual racial reconciliation.,There should be no more public money going to The Universities anymore they are no longer places of higher learning,It’s my understanding that he is for CRT and against white peopled adopting black kids. The fact that he thinks a liberal government and an anti racist amendment is needed reflects his socialist core beliefs. As a KU alum who fought for civil rights in the 60’s ::: I know from history and current events that he’s just trying to create more victims who will depend on government and collectivism. Time for KU to become more balanced and provide a platform for conservative speakers.

Maggie Grandsire,If being “anti racist” means discrimination of the whites and Asians::: is it really “anti racism”?!? Sounds to me it’s literally racist to form ANY judgment by race; good or bad.  Maybe professors should find an old-school dictionary for the definition. Maybe they should pose the question as to why everything that’s considered systematically racist is controlled by democrats; not unlike Jim Crow. So find a real history book as well.

If climate concerns are so dire::: why is it the same people that fly to luxury resorts::: instead of using conference calls?!?  Just a few for brevity.

We have made the decision to allow attendees to assemble on the Hill during Sunday’s Commencement exercises. Non-graduates should stay clear of the walkways at all times to allow our students to process smoothly. With caution and consideration::: this tradition can continue.,2021-05-15 18:19:02,KU's incompetence in handling this whole day is staggering. Abysmal::: untimely communication. No contingency plans. Oof.,I find it very hard to believe that a major university such as this one::: would neglect to exhaust all options before cancelling commencement ceremonies. I work at an institution who::: in planning for the weather::: had Plan B months in advance. They made the executive decision to utilize an indoor accommodation three days ahead of graduation and all was well. With the new CDC guidelines of 3 ft. social distancing could have been managed in::: say::: the Basketball Arena? Please allow these students who have come through such a difficult academic year to participate in a time-honored tradition without doing it virtually. Signed::: A 2021 MS.Ed Graduate,Such disappointment in the decision to cancel today’s graduation. There’s absolutely no excuse. Make it so bad the forecast has shown rain for today for the past week! And you owed it to the students and their families to have a back up plan down to the day. With that said::: you should have something today / tonight for them.,I don’t know if not being able to hold commencement indoors was so much a COVID thing for other universities like Kansas State was able to move their ceremonies indoors due to inclement weather. I don’t know if it’s more so upholding the tradition of walking down the hill. Unfortunately::: we are in the time of year where the weather is so unpredictable and severe weather is highest. Honestly::: graduates can walk down the hill on their own. I still think everyone would’ve actually liked a formal ceremony wherever that be::: indoor or outdoor. As a 2021 graduate I would’ve been fine with that. Unfortunately we may not be able to stick with the tradition that’s been around::: but we get something::: especially since we have all worked so hard.,KU failed these graduates and families in so many way this past year. Online did not work for many::: they essentially made the students teach themselves. Why were they charged full tuition::: when professors didn't answer emails::: had no office hours::: gave tests but didn't post grades grades until around Xmas. My grandson had no idea how he was even doing in the class. Professors were too lazy to plan and carry out graduation for their department when their were plenty of places at Ku that could have accommodated their students and family. Graduates also not helped to find jobs after graduation. Then::: the topper::: canceling graduation exercises when they knew a week in advance it was supposed to rain. They made no effort to make alternative plans. My girls and their husband's::: and my granddaughter went to KU had a wonderful experience. Yes::: it was a different year with covid::: but you could have done a better job. Too many were left to to teach themselves without any from their professors and they need to be accountable for their failures. You charged full tuition and gave the students very little teaching. You have failed as an institution that has been in the past a great school. Leave the politics out your video on honors graduation::: it was not appropriate!,Does this rule apply to the rescheduled Class of 2020 celebration next weekend?,‪Please don’t cancel all these graduations today because of the weather before brainstorming all options. If the storms won’t stop try moving it into Allen Fieldhouse before canceling. With only 1/3 of the class that should still work for “distancing guidelines.” Just help these kids graduate!!! ‬,And we Will still be able to get into the stadium?,I live in Illinois & due to the ticket limit I could not come. With that being said::: my grand sons parents are there and I have been watching the weather for over a week now and they have been calling for rain! So the university has been well aware of the weather situation and should have just had it inside to begin with! Plus the entire United States is well aware of Covid and it should have been left up to each individual on whether or not they wanted to come and sit next to someone whether they are related to them or not and wear a mask. Just my opinion from a 67 year old. And may I also give a shout out to the many graduates of K U Class of 2021 and of 2020::: CONGREGATIONS on all your all hard work and all the best to your future endeavors!,Always loved being an alumni of a liberal college. Until covid...this is insanity. Anyone know the mortality rate of KU students? I thought we were taught to question the status quo!,Move the 10:30 to Allen field House - why cancel?!?! So many have come from far away to watch the huge achievement. Don’t let us down::: KU.,Good!,I dont think the ceremony has ever in the last 30 years been canceled due to weather. Unreal. I didnt handle it very well but oh well....dont ever count on the weather in the midwest.,Will the Commencement be broadcast viral?,Beautiful view.,Not one photographer to do a simulated picture w diploma either! It was a joke this weekend.,Carla Sabus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Raise your hand if you’ve had a class in one of Budig Hall’s mondo lecture halls 🖐🏽,2021-03-26 15:04:02,I was in a fishing class on a Saturday when we took a break and saw Hoch get hit with lightening::: so we called 911.,No classes in Budig::: but I had plenty in Snow Hall on the right.,I was walking to class one morning when I met a man in a comical outfit. I decided it was worth being late to my class to figure out who this was::: so I turned around and followed him. He walked into Hoch Auditorium::: down the center aisle::: to the front of the room. I found an empty seat and sat down. It was Dr. Bricker and his final lecture of the semester. I could not remember what class I was heading to::: but I will not forget following him to his lecture.,I had Western Civ there in little cubicles on the floor. Very distracting! But I did manage to pass the course! Also remember picking up enrollment cards there::: maybe for Spring semester! 1966,When it was Hoch::: Chem 184 and 188 (Prof. Grover Everett). Hist 128 (Prof. David Katzman). Many concerts as well. That was a lifetime ago. 😃,Great. RCJK! LOVE YOU,Biology 10something in old Hoch. Not the most engaging atmosphere.,Many! I actually loved taking classes in Budig! (I was also probably one of the few who never skipped a class held in Budig.),Registration in old Hoch Auditorium back in early 1970s::: and many great concerts,"I was on campus the day Hoch was hit by lightning. I think (but could be wrong) I had just finished my ""Fish Kansas"" class. https:// kuhistory.ku.edu /articles/ fahrenheit-53000",1984 or 85::: when it was just Hoch auditorium::: I believe it was a Chem 184 course with Dr. Earl Huyser::: with hundreds of classmates. Still remember the day when class was interrupted by three streaking fraternity pledges and Dr. Huyser nonchalantly commented::: “they could’ve shown their best side”::: before continuing with his lecture. Good times!,"Chem 150 in Hoch Auditorium. And freshman convocation. And ""Into the Woods"" on the stage!",Went to concerts at Hoch Auditorium before the fire and name change,My freshman registration in the fall of ‘88 was in Hoch Auditorium. I missed the fire a few years later (I was home for the summer)::: but::: boy...what a shock it was to come back to campus and see the charred shell of the old place.,"In the late 60's::: I enrolled in one of KU's most popular classes and it was held in Hoch. Dr. William Bass's Anthropology 1 classes were held there::: and were the ""largest"" classes at KU at that time. The auditorium::: including the balcony were full for his lectures. Dr. Bass was very big on human anatomy::: human remains identification and was famous for his risque lectures. One of his bawdy lecture events was written up in Readers Digest back then.  Dr. Bass left KU for the University of Tennessee::: where he established the famed ""body farm"" to study human decomposition::: an idea he conceived while at KU.",The class was bigger than my hometown. Greek and Roman Mythology::: 8am Tue/Thu. It was my welcome to a big::: public university. And I loved it.,I saw a very funny comedian (wearing a white suit and with arrow through his head) as the warm up act to the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band there in about '73.,Many Chemistry classes in old Hoch.,I had chemistry with the infamous Clark Bricker in Hoch auditorium and I enjoyed various concerts there::: including the annual Vespers and R.E.M. It was a sad day when it burned.,I had Chem 184 in Hoch Auditorium before the fire. Albert Burgstahler was the prof. I also had a US history course in there. I recall pulling an all-nighter prepping for the final exam. When I arrived at the final::: we were told there was a bomb threat and the final would be a take-home final. Needless to say::: I was not happy.,No::: but had Chemistry 184 in Hoch Auditorium with almost 1:::000 of my closest Freshmen friends. Probably why I never became that Engineer I thought I wanted to be. Thank God for unanswered prayers.,Concerts to include my first opera. Unfortunately - I watched it burn::: It was surreal.,Nothing compared to lectures in Hoch Auditorium though. :),The real question: who watched the Jayhawks play basketball there?,🖐🏻Sociology 101 with Daryl Evans. Plus Bill T Jones & Alvin Ailey Dance Company::: and Angela Davis. KU offered so much! ❤️,It caught on fire the summer before my freshman year...so No☹️,Don't think there was a Budig Hall back in the 50s.,Where were biology and chemistry lectures held in the sixties ? Not sure where the big lecture hall was located. I can picture sitting there but I have no idea which building it was. Did Mallot have a lecture hall!,Chem 184 in Hoch with Dr. Bricker. First semester freshmen::: first college exam along with 1:::000 other students!,Loved my big Budig classes! ♥️💙,We had a campus radio station in the basement of Hoch. KUOK On my first air shift I thought it was going well. And then::: I got a news flash that Jim Croce had died. The phone lines lit up. My only problem was I had never heard of Jim Croce.,No. But I had one when it was Hoch Auditorium before the fire.,Had a couple of finals in Hoch::: but no classes.,General and organic chem. For one organic exam::: I slept through my alarm. I dreamt I was outside the building and couldn't decide which door to enter: ortho::: meta or para (you'll laugh if you took organic). That woke me up and I made it just in time.,It's been so long since I was there::: all I remember is the shin splints I got walking up and down the hills! Oh ::: yes and the parties!,Registered in Hoch auditorium::: concerts::: computer programming::: probably others but I forget.,I was a grad student at KU and so had none there.,Macroecon::: Microecon::: and Financial Accounting🖐,Loved budig! Sign in for the class then leave! Jk::: no one would everrrr do that 👀🤣😁,Chem 184 and 188 lectures.,Had a class...or actually went?,Who remembers the fire?,Me!,✌🏼,Accounting 101 / Psychology 101 - 1996,Raising my hand for Todd Ohlemeier...,I had several!!,I’ve had two!,Yep::: chem.,Pretty sure I did,🙋‍♀️,🖐🏼,🤚🏼,✋,✋,😄,Nerp.

Their answer to everything is ""look at the online edition"" which I have to pay for in my subscription but seldom use ($1200/year for print and online). Also::: the paper is printed in KC so ""late"" news and sports are never timely. The original call to them (among many lately) was because they ""chopped"" a story. ""Continue on page six"" but is not only wasn't on page six::: it was NOWHERE. Also they just use ""spell check"" instead of actually proofreading the copy::: so ""there::: they're::: and their"" are rendered equal.

Did you know KU’s majestic Fraser Hall replaced another building with the same name in nearly the same spot that was razed in 1965? Old Fraser Hall (left)::: dedicated in 1874::: and its 1967 replacement were named for John Fraser::: KU’s second chancellor.,2021-01-07 22:30:21,I had class in Fraser fall of 1967,Had classes in the old version. ❤️,I had classes in Old Frazier! What a beauty!,I had several classes in the original Fraser in the mid to late 50s.,New Fraser is architectural junk. Had many clinical psych. classes in this bldg.::: and thought it to be a mess. Liked the old Fraser better...,In the new Frazier::: I had heard there was a crack in the foundation caused by blasting within the area for further developments - to the point they were not sure the current building could stand - Anyone able to shed light on this?,I was there and watched the demolition. The university architect said old Frazier couldn’t be rehabilitated. That was a lie. The new Frazier didn’t didn’t have towers. It was and is an ugly building when compared to old Frazier. It was a tragic day in KU history.KU’s preservation efforts seem to have improved although::: the majestic interior of Watson was desecrated in the main reading room. I have been involved with historic preservation for many decades and received an award from The National Trust for Historic Preservation.,Statute of limitations has expired. My living group hung the first flag over New Frazier before it was ever opened. It was a green dyed shower curtain with three Js painted on it. Stood for the Jolly Jolliffe Jocks from Jolliffe Scholarship Hall:::,If you attended KU in the 70s or 80s::: this was common knowledge::: and TRAGIC common knowledge. Standing in front of the new Fraser::: it was difficult to comprehend how they could have razed such a beautiful work of 1800s architecture.,I remember a large lecture hall in the old Fraser. The roof leaked. If it was raining you had to choose your seat carefully.,"Next to the truly horrible Wescoe Hall::: New Fraser is probably the ugliest building on campus. I had classes in Old Fraser::: including in the beautiful wood-paneled auditorium with the gorgeous organ. Later I had classes in the brand new replacement::: which resembles nothing so much as a prison. ""Majestic?"" You jest.",Had French and Latin classes upstairs in Old Fraser. The classroom doors did not close.,Old Frazier was replaced by new Frazier. But::: Mccollum Hall was replaced by a parking lot! quite a difference.,"Eh... it's ""majestic"" only because it's big and in the prime location. The old one was MUCH better architecturally . If it couldn't be rehabilitated they should have at least built something new that looked as good. Unfortunately this has happened a few times. Lovely older buildings on campus demolished and replaced by newer modern ones that don't really fit the aesthetic.",Classes were still offered there in the early - mid 60s.,Plus the theatre in Fraser was lovely.,Most KU enthusiasts are aware of old Fraser and new Fraser.,I had several in the new one.,The steps were worn down by all the people before us....,Had classes there and watched it come down.,And some of the limestone was used for other projects.,"I'm nostalgic for the days when the worst things people had to write letters to the editor about were the razing of old Frazer and how vulgar 'The Twist"" were.",Old Fraser was more grand and eloquent. The wonderful weathered old stairs creaked back at you with every step.,New Fraser is a box - wish I seen old Fraser,I::: too::: had classes in old Frazier and was sad to see it come down.,Is this what we got due to state funding and lowest bidder,I went to Mass in the old Frasier hall in 1961!,https:// kansaspress.ku.e du/ 978-0-9613712-0- 3.html,I think it was still there in the spring of 1965 when I graduated.,Me::: too! Glad to have been there one year (64-65) with it! In the union there is a room decorated with wood::: cabinetry::: window::: etc. from old Frazier.,Tomas Andreas,Yes,I had several classes in Old Fraser in the mid 50's.,I remember English classes with wonderful Dr. Nelick.,reminds me of good old days.,Yes I did know that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Did you know a visual artistic link — two stone owls staring at each other across Jayhawk Boulevard — has existed for nearly 120 years between Dyche Hall (dedicated in 1902)::: and Spooner Hall (1894)?

KU has plugged into a new wind farm in Nemaha County that will offset the electric power needs of the Lawrence campus with renewable energy for the next 20 years — at a stable rate that will save $250:::000-$350:::000 annually.  NEWS.KU.EDU New wind farm helps KU offset electricity needs,2020-12-07 14:55:02,Where will they bury the blades ten years from now when they are no longer functional?

This might look great::: but there are unintended consequences that come with it.,I have always wondered what happens in a tornado . We are kind of famous for those .,Malarkey! Unless you have a direct mainline to the place::: your use is no better than your neighbor’s next door::: and is simply the overall power mix of the grid you’re hooked up too.

Idiots.,There's definitely plenty of wind in Kansas.,I have a strong feeling those projected savings will be much::: much lower.,Show us the economics! When the wind doesn’t blow (2/3 of the time) gas turbines are supplying the energy. All of the extra facilities required more than offset the “free” wind energy.

Students are waiting over an hour for a meal and they are running out of food. Can we get food trucks there and link them to the meal plan ????,"One thing I'd like to know is why Student Housing is asking scholarship hall students to access additional ""community resources:::"" including food banks::: instead of providing a meal plan that would cover the full 21 meals per week they would normally have access to were their own kitchens allowed to be open. As an alumna of the scholarship hall system::: I find this really shortsighted on behalf of the University. I realize the University is in a difficult situation::: I really do. But asking students to rely on food banks is not the best look. EDIT: to be clear::: Housing will cover 14 meals::: but that is not enough.",My question AGAIN.... when will the 2020 IN PERSON graduation be held for the students? I understand the concern of COVID-19. But you have allowed students back on campus for the fall semester. Please advise so students AND out of state parents can plan.,Groups 45 and smaller huh?

Makes my alma mater look classy when frat boys chuck alcohol into the cars of lost Lawrence residents. Frats have always been a problem at KU and the university does nothing to keep them in check.,I appreciate the disability inclusion but in the middle of a pandemic::: your fraternity Kappa Sigma at the University of Kansas followed no safety protocols::: assaulted an innocent resident who was lost::: falsely imprisoned him by blocking him in so he could not leave::: and potentially infected him with COVID.  To date::: no one from the fraternity or the university has called to at the very least apologize to this man. Because of this incident::: he will probably have to quarantine for 15 days to make sure he has not been infected. Kappa Sigma should be responsible for any and all medical tests and medical requirements if this man does come down with COVID.  The individuals who assaulted him and committed false imprisonment by refusing to let him leave should be brought up on charges.  All the residents of the house and those who attended the part should be tested for COVID and Kappa Sigma should be responsible for the costs.

CNN calls on Kelly H. Chong::: a KU sociology professor::: to explain cultural appropriation as part of a controversy about a beauty trend called “fox eye:::” which critics say is racist because of its similarity to Asian eyes.  CNN.COM The 'fox eye' beauty trend continues to spread online. But critics insist it's racist,2020-08-19 18:15:03,https:// www.facebook.com /groups/ 2935909079818694 /?ref=share,wtf,The whole point of makeup is to have fun and accentuate your features. I don't think anyone putting on their eyeliner does it with the intention of imitating another race::: unless they're cosplayers or work in the theater::: and then it's because they're becoming a specific character. Moreover it's called FOX EYE makeup::: not ASIAN EYE makeup. If you look at a fox's eye::: it makes sense where the trend gets its name. But for the sake of the argument::: if fox eye makeup counts as cultural appropriation::: what about cat eye makeup? The styles are pretty similar looking. Do we need to stop wearing that too? Should non-asians get upset about Koreans using double eyelid tape or doing cut creases? Should we also restrict the colors that people of different races are allowed to dye their hair if it's not a color that commonly occurs in their racial or ethnic group?  I don't believe anything about this trend is racist. Telling people they can't wear it if they're not a certain race::: on the other hand::: most definitely is. If seeing people of all colors and backgrounds elongating the wings on their eyeliner ruins your day::: perhaps you should be reexamining your own values and rethinking your own views on race. At the very least::: please get a hobby 🙄,Did any of you actually read the article? Good lord. It’s not even entirely about the eye makeup and it makes sense. FFS.,God forbid people go more than 5 minutes without finding a reason to be offended.,I see very little different from the cat’s eye effect you can do with eyeliner... 🤔,For real::: just stop already. This is ridiculous. For the record::: this doesn’t offend me one bit. I can only speak for myself but I’m pretty sure there are many others like me who feel the same way. Stop it. 🤦‍♂️,people have been using makeup to look different for years I know lots of girls in the 80s used this eyeliner trend it wasn’t to look Asian.,And in Korea they constantly have eye surgery for a more westerner eye look. That’s racist!,You know what really grinds my gears? When people culturally appropriate my western medicine::: education::: and technology. It’s not ok. 🙄,"Seems like whoever is saying that it's racist is the only one who thinks that all Asians have ""slanty"" eyes.  That's what is called projection.",It sounds like whoever thinks this is more of a racist than those who do it. It's called fox-eye yet you want to equate it with Asian eyes? Pot kettle black. For shame KU I thought you were more intelligent than this,CNN says everything and everybody is racist!!..🙄😂,Interesting.... Of course::: the ancient Egyptians used thick::: elaborate eyeliner eons ago and that culture’s style continues to influence many in the world today. “Elaborate sarcophagi depict faces with heavy eye-liner.”  https:// www.bbc.com/ culture/article/ 20160204-how-anc ient-egypt-shap ed-our-idea-of- beauty,Give me a break. People just want something to whine about.,Sounds to me like the critics are racist. Be yourself .,🤯,I think someone who wants to wear makeup to accentuate their features a way they desire is not wrong or racist. Looking at someone’s subtle eye makeup and saying “that looks like Asian people eyes::: I don’t like that and you shouldn’t do that::: it’s racist” sounds WAYYYY more racist to me. I feel like if Michael Scott had an assignment to address racism in the office he would come up with this,Rachael Sneed Soyeon Kim what do you two think of this?,Janae Love,How ridiculous.

As part of our #protectKU plan::: all Jayhawks on campus will receive mandatory COVID-19 testing this fall. Tests will be free::: rapid::: and saliva-based — no swabs necessary! More details here:  PROTECT.KU.EDU Protect KU,2020-08-12 14:50:01,today I thought to recharge my Kindle again. My Kindle is really powerful. I bought it from online shop when I was in 303B dorm in Clinton hall. It has UB power also. But J people and max is causing me harms that's for sure. Also Ani people. I am now cool with K.,So why play sports this year? That was a bad decision!,The accuracy of rapid::: saliva testing is less than the accuracy of the 3 to 4 day::: nasal swab testing. Please share how KU's rapid testing matches the accuracy of the 3 to 4 day::: nasal swab. KU does not want to cause unnecessary fear and loss of instructional and social/ emotional time with a false test.,Ryan Lant,We need a working Dining Hall for the students waiting over an hour in line for a meal and they are running out of food. How quickly can we get food trucks in there and link it to the meal plan????,how is this being enforced? are you keeping track of who does and does not get a test done and barring those who don't from coming back to campus? why are housing residents exempt from being tested prior to coming to campus? being tested in the lobby of their dorm on move in day is dangerous::: if they are positive they just exposed the desk assistant and the person administering the test. if we are required to be tested before coming to campus then no one should be exempt from that::: especially not housing residents.,Is KU in need of any PPE products? I have wipes::: gloves and mask here in the US.,This sure seems like a DNA test. How can we be sure KU is not gathering DNA also? Seems like a cheek swab would be sufficient.,But let's keep those sports going on because we need that money.,My biggest question is... will KU be offering quick and free re-testing for students who test positive? The cheek swab is far from 100% accurate and does give many false positives and false negatives. A positive test will have a huge impact on a student. Another important question is will KU require a subsequent negative test after a positive test to return to campus or will it be symptom based? COVID tests for some have been shown to remain positive for months despite resolution of symptoms::: and that could be detrimental for students with in person labs/classes.,Awesome!!! Way to be proactive & help students & faculty out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Still a refreshing hangout::: the Chi Omega Fountain has provided a font of memories since it was dedicated in 1955. What's your best memory of the Chi Omega Fountain?  📸: Marketing Communications + University Archives,2020-07-07 15:10:12,I was at a funeral for a dear friend (second mom) a few years back. Her brother was at KU in the 40s. Seems he was invited not to come back due to a “soap incident” at the Chi O fountain. #tradition,A birthday dip there.,many graduating pictures taken there,Birthdays celebrated there.🤣,Might have had something to do with bubble bath...maybe.,So many peaceful and beautiful moments walking Jayhawk Blvd to and from campus.,Biggest memory not favorite...The purple dye that wouldn't go away. Took a bunch of drains to clear that out.,Bubbles arising like clouds from the fountain in the 70s.,When Osama Bin Laden was killed and everyone went there to celebrate.,Bunch of us decided to play in it after a home football game. Would be fall 1997 I think...,Soapy times! And 1957 graduation pictures. We were really proud of the fountain.,My favorite part of the fountain isn't there anymore. There was a brass pineapple (traditional symbol of welcome) on top - the water flowed gently down through the upright leaves of the pineapple. The whole water flow was much more gentle then.,So much fun carrying/ dragging my sisters down the street and throwing them in ! Good times. Megan A Lewis hid under the piano to avoid the plunge. Sneaky girl. 💜,In the early 90's there were trees surrounding the fountain - friends and I would sit under the trees and eat lunch!,I was thrown in on my 18th birthday in front of hundreds of students in line for the Lynyrd Skynyrd concert at Hoch Auditorium!,My all time favorite place to dump full boxes of laundry detergent.,People would put soap flakes or liquid in it when I was in college and watch it bubble up!,I got thrown in every year on my birthday!! The end of October !!,We used to ride our bikes in the summer to campus. After riding around and playing by the Campanile::: we would be really hot. We would get in the fountain and get really wet before riding home. We had no idea that we weren't supposed to get in the fountain. So glad we never got caught!,A certain friend (who shall remain nameless) was thrown into the fountain naked; he jumped on the trolley and rode it home::: buck-naked...an ybody else remember that?,That is where the Marching Band gathered before marching down the hill to the stadium.,Gail....any pictures of you in the Chi O fountain?,In the good ol days people were thrown in buck naked for their birthday. 😁😂,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Learn to live with the virus it isn’t going away.,THE DYING ADMINISTRATION OF BUNKER INSPECTOR WIMPY WICKED COCKROACH TOTAL STIFF AND HIGHLY OVERRATED DONALD TRUMP HAS FAILED THE COUNTRY. HE HAS BEEN A COMPLETE MISERABLE FAILURE SINCE DAY ONE. HE’S LIKE A DEFLATED BALLOON AND LESS AND LESS PEOPLE ARE LISTENING TO HIM.  TRUMP IS THE BIGGEST ENEMY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. IT DOESN’T MATTER IF YOU’RE WEARING A MAGA HAT AND YOU VOTE FOR HIM::: HE STILL HATES YOU.  According to Donald Trump’s niece::: Mary Trump::: Donald stole money from his father::: he didn’t inherit it. I saw a poll showing Biden beating Trump by 44 points. Biden is leading Trump by double digits in ALL the battleground states.  “The man (Joe Biden) is going to be your president because some people don’t love me.”- Donald Trump 06/25/20  “Former Vice-President Joe Biden leads President Donald Trump 50-36 percent. Independents favor Biden by 18 points. Men are nearly evenly split but women prefer Biden by 22 points::: and both voters over 45 years of age and white voters are evenly split while younger voters and both Black and Latino voters are strongly with Biden:::” said Siena College Research Institute Director Don Levy. “Trump’s favorability nationally is a negative 40-56 percent while Biden’s is a positive 52-42 percent. “Among the 61 percent of voters that say that they are almost certain to vote in November::: Biden’s lead slips a little to 51-40 percent:::” Levy said. By 56-41 percent::: voters disapprove of the way Trump is handling his job as President. Sixty-two percent of voters disapprove of the way the President is handling the protests after the death of George Floyd::: 61 percent disapprove of his handling of race relations::: and 58 percent disapprove of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic.” - New York Times /Siena College National  HE EXPECTED 1 MILLION PEOPLE::: BUT ONLY 1:::578 REAL ATTENDEES SHOWED UP TO HIS RALLY IN TULSA (THEY WERE BORED AND FALLING ASLEEP). PROTESTERS DID NOT SHOW UP. MELANIA STAYED HOME::: ONLY TWO REPUBLICAN SENATORS ACCOMPANIED HIM. TRUMP IS A COMPLETE FAILURE.  THIS IS A CRIME: “When you do testing to that extent::: you are gonna find more people::: you’re gonna find more cases. So::: I said to my people::: slow the testing down please.” – Donald Trump at Tulsa Rally  Donald Trump is not America. The United States of America doesn’t have a President::: nor a functional Congress. The whole nation grieves watching helplessly at the WICKED Republican Party turning a blind eye to the ambitions of the sociopathic dictator.  IF IT IS SAFE TO MAIL TAX REFUNDS::: SOCIAL SECURITY CHECKS::: STIMULUS CHECKS::: DRAFT REGISTRATIONS::: PRESCRIPTION DRUGS::: PASSPORTS::: YOUR DRIVER’S LICENSE::: OR THE ACTUAL ID YOU’D USE TO VOTE… THEN IT IS SAFE TO VOTE BY MAIL.  If Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany::: RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel::: Vice President Mike Pence::: his wife Karen & President Donald J. Trump vote by mail::: every American should be able to::: too!  It kind of screws up the plans to hack voting machines and to close voting sites when people all vote by mail.  HE’S NOT WELL. HE’S WEAK AND LACKS CHARACTER::: MORALITY AND PRINCIPLES. THINKS HE’S ABOVE THE LAW. HE’S DAMAGED::: CORRUPT AND DANGEROUS. HE’S STUCK::: PINNED DOWN::: BOUND::: AND UNABLE TO MOVE FORWARD.  “Trump to replace SDNY prosecutor with lawyer who defended Deutsche Bank from money laundering scandal. On Friday night::: the Attorney General William Barr announced that Geoffrey Berman::: the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York::: will be stepping down. His replacement will be Jay Clayton — who previously represented Deutsche Bank::: one of President Donald Trump’s most significant business creditors::: from allegations they facilitated Russian money laundering.” – Matthew Chapman  “Trump campaign accused of wire fraud by former U.S. ambassador and White House Special Counsel for Ethics and Government Reform Norm Eisen. A screenshot of a text purportedly is from the Trump campaign::: specifically saying it is from Donald Trump Jr. ‘My father asked me to text you. He reached out to 100 patriots to join the Trump 100 Club. You’re the ONLY 1 who didn’t join. Join NOW:::’ it reads::: followed by a URL that links to a Republican fundraising site::: WinRed. ‘This is 18 USC 1343 wire fraud by Trump campaign:::’ Eisen charges. ‘This is 18 USC 1343 wire fraud by Trump campaign. No way the other 99 really replied::: so all elements are met 1) scheme to defraud 2) with intent to defraud & 3) foreseeable & actual use of interstate wire comms.’ – Norm Eisen. ‘These are the kinds of fraudulent marketing techniques that Trump has used since the beginning of his career:::’ Eisen goes on to say::: ‘and that led to outcomes like the huge Trump U. fraud settlement the shuttering of his charity by NY State.’” – David Badash  WHY WOULD ANY AMERICAN SUPPORT A MAN WHO HIDES BEHIND A DOUBLE FENCE::: BARRICADING HIMSELF INSIDE THE (PUBLICLY OWNED) WHITE HOUSE::: KEEPING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AWAY FROM HIM? BY KEEPING HIMSELF INSIDE THE FORTRESS::: TRUMP IS ABDICATING HIS POWERS AND HIS ROLE AS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.  “Puritan Medical Products::: manufacturer of COVID-19 testing swabs::: said it’s discarding the entire output created while President Donald Trump toured the plant without a mask. Trump visited the plant that produces sterile swabs and mingled with workers who wore white lab coats::: masks::: gloves::: hair coverings::: goggles and booties. During his appearance at the Puritan factory in Guilford::: Trump made a few remarks to workers::: posed for photos::: and put his arm around an employee::: saying::: “I’m not supposed to do that:::” then waved his hand dismissively. Trump wore no face mask nor any other protective gear::: which is his typical controversial protocol::: despite recommendations to the contrary by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. He stopped to talk to employees — who were wearing white lab coats::: masks::: gloves::: goggles::: hair coverings and plastic booties — while working with the sterile swabs.” - Mary Papenfuss  YOU CAN’T BE A PRESIDENT VIA TWITTER “Donald J. Trump is no longer president of the United States. By having no constructive response to any of the monumental crises now convulsing America::: Trump has abdicated his office. He is not governing. He’s golfing::: watching cable TV::: and tweeting. He has incited more police violence. Trump called the protesters “thugs” and threatened to have them shot. More than 41 million Americans are jobless. In the coming weeks temporary eviction moratoriums are set to end in half of the states. One-fifth of Americans missed rent payments this month. Extra unemployment benefits are set to expire at the end of July. The Democratic-led House passed a $3 trillion relief package on May 15. Mitch McConnell has recessed the Senate without taking action and Trump calls the bill dead on arrival. The House has passed nearly 400 bills this term::: including measures to reduce climate change::: enhance election security::: require background checks on gun sales::: reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act and reform campaign finance. All are languishing in McConnell’s inbox. Trump doesn’t seem to be aware of any of them. There is nothing inherently wrong with golfing::: watching television and tweeting. But if that’s pretty much all that a president does when the nation is engulfed in crises::: he is not a president. Trump’s tweets are no substitute for governing. They are mostly about getting even.” – Robert Reich  The large presence of the U.S. military security forces in D.C. reflects Trump’s desperation::: ineptitude and lack of skills to do his job. It reflects his lack of leadership::: his paranoia and lack of interest of being the people’s President. He’s::: instead::: afraid of the people::: and confirming what we have known since day one- he’s there for himself. Trump is a coward::: he hides::: he’s loud::: but he’s totally empty inside.

As the fall semester approaches::: the university continues to develop plans to reopen campus. Our goal is to welcome back as many students as we can while continuing to prioritize the health of the community.  Visit KU’s online hub for coronavirus-related updates (https://coronavirus.ku.edu/) for information about how these plans affect the following categories:  🗓️ 2020-21 Academic calendar 🏛️ Course scheduling and classroom configuration 🦠 Testing and contact tracing 🏘️ Housing and dining,2020-06-23 15:54:03,Aastha Wadhwa,As a mother of a senior Jayhawk and an incoming freshman::: I appreciate the university giving students the opportunity to live on campus and have in person classes. My understanding is that students who don’t feel comfortable with that can take those same classes on line so the plan really does accommodate all students,I’m “borrowing” that photo. 💕,I hope you go fully online with few exceptions and mimimize the risk of Covid. I’d hate for KU to have a covid related death on campus.,When is the Commencement Ceremony going to scheduled for the class of 2020?

Those are mutually exclusive statements.",“Our goal” isn’t enough of a plan to pay full price for new freshman students.

START COMMUNISM!!!! PSLWEB.ORG,Thanks,There are rich racist capitalists and rich racist capitalist politicians lying to the masses about communism and capitalism so they can continue to exploit the majority of people and corruptly dominate the world. Humanity must not let this corruption continue so we must understand what is causing this corruption and how we can create a righteous solution and the only way for we the people to do this is to understand something very simple and that is capitalism is corrupt and communism is righteous. There are only two ways for humanity to live and that is equally or unequally and communism is everyone living equally and fairly yet capitalism is everyone living very unequally and very unfairly. Capitalism is about exploitation::: inequality::: injustice::: corrupt segregation and slavery::: war and hate yet communism is the end of exploitation and creating equality::: justice::: righteous unity and freedom::: peace and love. Communism is about all of humanity equally earning and equally sharing the work and resources of the world for the righteous upliftment of everyone and the environment so we will all live good. Therefore the truth is we are all morally obligated to be communist so we can come as close as humanly possible to ending corruption and creating as much equality and righteousness as we can so that there will truly be justice for all.,Communism is the only way for humanity to be humane and the most humane society can be. China::: Cuba and all the other countries that have in the past and still are calling themselves communist are not and have never been communist::: they are communist only in name::: communism has never existed on a mass scale yet people judge communism on the poor capitalist conditions these communist only in name countries are in or have been in making people misinterpret and falsely believe that communism is a corrupt failure yet in fact it is the complete opposite because capitalism is the reason for all the corrupt failure for every country throughout the history of the world and when communism is implemented properly it will absolutely be a righteous success for everyone in a equal and fair nationless world without borders and that is the absolute truth.,Suh dude?,🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏,Thanks for your support,Amen,Staci Baird::: I saw this story and your sister came to mind!

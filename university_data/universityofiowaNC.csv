The Hawkeyes are headed to the Big Ten Championship game!! It's great to be a Hawkeye!,2021-11-27 19:34:00,Living in Ohio::: this is the best thing we could have seen today! Painful to cheer for MN but way to go Gophers! 🖤🏈💛,OMGosh! Iowa plays Michigan this coming weekend and I'm torn. I live in Michigan but LIVED IN IOWA for about 10 years AND my son was born in Iowa City! Yes I love the Hawkeyes but I also love Michigan. I'm already stressing. It should be a good game though.,Woo Hoo. It’s great to b a Hawkeye!,I always cheer for the B1G (minus Ohio::: they always have a chip on their shoulder) whenever Iowa isn’t playing. I was cheering so hard for Nebraska and Minnesota last weekend and this weekend for sure. I really thought I’d the Gophers won that Iowa would be playing Ohio State. I didn’t know Michigan had won until I saw the matchup for the B1G title game. That Michigan team is good this year. As much as I will cheer for the Hawks::: I am hoping they just don’t get slaughtered. That the D plays their best next weekend and that the special teams is as fantastic as they’ve been all year and also that the offense can actually get something going and look like a #2 team again worthy of playing in this game. I love the Hawks. Just being realistic.,Minnesota doing jump around on the field! Priceless!,"Congrats Hawkeyes.
Don't ever take for granted that you get to continue playing football at this time of the year.

(Saturday night has already been decided. Don't even bother showing up.)

Hawkeyes make it seven in a row against the Golden Gophers! Final: Iowa 27::: Minnesota 22,2021-11-13 19:06:00,Brian Ferentz has much to answer for again. Such poor play calling. The hearts of the men on the field won this one. Go Hawks.,Think of it this way. Alex Padilla played a pretty darn good game and his mobility to run outside the pocket and successfully pass on while he running is a plus. Jeez the forward pass is still part of football at Iowa. You want a better run game then the offensive line has to open up some holes. Plus come out with a completely different mindset instead of playing so close the vest.,It wasn't pretty::: but Iowa doesn't play pretty. We play for the W. My biggest problem is the play calling when we were inside the 5::: why didn't we run Goodson? Give that man the ball 3 times in a row and he scores (as long as all 3 isn't up the middle... which Iowa does... the man has speed and cuts... should've tried an outside run::: then a play action pass::: followed by him up the middle... then and only then if you haven't scored - which I think we would've with the first run to the outside::: then you kick the field goal)... but whatever::: a W is a W and I'm sooooo happy for my Hawks,Cowardly win by the Hawkeyes today. 2 QB sneaks from the 3 yard line?? Play to win::: score a TD there and the game would have been over. Coaches should be ashamed of themselves.,I'm so thankful that the Hawkeyes one tonight however could we please with two minutes and 18 seconds left in the game on the goal line run a few running plays instead of quarterback sneaks.,Wish the running game would show up,Hankins continues his awfulness,23 years of playing not to lose football is getting really old. We’d be undefeated with 2021 schemes instead of 1980s coaching. Please retire!,It was a great game. 🖤💛🖤,Anybody else annoyed by the Gopher Qbacks always stepping back and looking at the bench...every single offensive play...?,The Ferentz family is still trying to lose rather than trying to win. Get them the hell out of there. Who runs sneak not trying to score at the end? Who runs on third and long in the 4th quarter?,"Iowa wave. 💛🖤 Iowa rules.
In heaven there is no beer.
That's why we drink it here (Right Here!)
and when we're gone from here:::
our friends will be drinking all the beer!",Go Hawks!!🖤💛,Yes the hog stays home go hawks,"Happy for the win but once again our players were subjected to horrible play calling by our horrible offensive coordinator. #firebrianferent

Why would you qb sneak twice on the 3 when you could give it to your back?,Like it or not 8-2 is pretty good,That was so dumb by coach. Score a TD and put it out of reach. We should not have to squirm in our seats for :39. Dumb!!!!,When are all you people going to realize it’s not the OC it’s Kirk’s team and everything goes through him,Kept the pig.

This weekend::: Hawkeye Football again brought home the Floyd of Rosedale trophy. The birth of the traveling trophy wasn’t just a silly wager between two border-state governors.

"Hancher is approaching is 50th anniversary. You don't have to look to see how the ""the largest classroom on campus"" has had an impact on Iowa. https://bit.ly/3EQAbv2",2021-10-24 12:00:00,I worked as an usher and then an aisle captain at old Hancher while I was in grad school. As a result::: I was fortunate to see many “big name” productions::: as well as several minor ones.,Graduated at a wonderful celebration in December 1977. The highlight was receiving my diploma from President Willard (Sandy) Boyd. A very memorable day in my life.,While they were building the new Hancher the University held many smaller concerts in the old Thomas More Church west of Hancher on the other side of Riverside Drive. Many nights during intermission I would go out on the balcony of the church and look over the trees at the progress of the new building. It was subtly uplifting to see it coming through some years when many buildings had been damaged in the flood of 2008. It is a fine improvement over its predecessor.,I performed there during All State Music Camp back in the 70s. (Actually at the Union before the old Hancher was completed.) Then as a student I was an usher from 1977-1979. A most enjoyable time of my life.,Awesome photos of a great college campus at the University of Iowa. Part of the campus .,I lived across the River from this gorgeous building! I saw the world premiere of world according to Garp.,Went to see Waitress Friday night - was very disappointed at the LACK OF MASKS in the audience.,It wasn’t there when I was a student at Iowa in the 1950’s. I have seen the outside but never been in it.,I got my Masters in Jan of ‘72 so I don’t remember it at all. Wow::: makes me feel old.,Is this the same building that was built in the early 1970’s::: then flooded out when that disastrous flood occurred when the river overflowed its banks?,Usher::: 72-73::: House Manager 73-75 under James Wockenfuss.,Amazing place!! Past and Present! Future Bright for that Beautiful Building!!,saw some great artists at hancher - such as Sweet Honey in the Rock!,So many fond memories there!,Love Hancher. But won't go until there's masks required.,Cool...,♥♥♥,Connie Cramer Caster,Saw Bruce Springsteen there when he was just getting known,First concert hall I ever walked into as a student::: probably in 1981 or '82. I think it was Evita that I attended. I'm sure this hall opened the eyes::: ears::: hearts and minds of many an Iowa student.,Beautiful place!!,Stunning building!,Impressive!!! 😃♥️,Beautiful theater.,Beautiful building!,Love Hancher…Miss Hancher,I wish I were there.,Livia Centeno de Pesce,"don’t thank 😏

"When Hayden Fry came to Iowa in 1979 to instill a sense of solidarity among his players::: he introduced ""the swarm."" Instead of simply jogging onto the field before games::: Fry had his players lock hands::: with the captains leading the way out of the tunnel.",2021-10-16 11:00:00,"I wanted the players to feel like they were part of a family::: to be conscious of that controlled togetherness as they made that slow entrance onto the field. It had a great psychological effect on the opposing team::: too. They'd never seen anything like it.

Hayden Fry",The Swarm is awesome. Got to see it in Tucson and Tempe in AZ. The only game I got to see Hayden Fry coach live. Go Hawks!,"It's an amazing sight to watch all of those young men ""swarm"" out of the tunnel on game day. Go::: Hawks!",Hayden was a Psychology major. He changed the uniforms to look like the Steelers . More importantly he had the visiting locker room painted pink!,Coach Fry was a creative thinker and understood how important culture was. He gave Iowa the Tiger Hawk::: updated uniforms::: the swarm::: a pink locker room for visitors and so much more. He was great coach and brilliant leader.,I'll never forget seeing the first swarm! Hayden Fry's first game at Iowa was also my first game! Thanks::: Coach! Go Hawks!,Hayden Fry brought so much more to the Iowa football program!! And Hawkeye Nation has never looked back! Go Hawks!,I remember this like it was yesterday! He also redesigned the uniforms to mimic the Steelers. The goal posts started coming down as well. Fond memories,Going to football games when Hayden started was so refreshing. Before he came::: I would start the game with “Welcome back to Iowa football with Bobby Cummings as coach and Bobby Cummings Jr as quarterback “ and watch them proceed to lose again🤣. Still went to the games though 🖤💛🖤💛,We have a lot of great traditions! Color coordinating the seating. Waving to the children at the Children's hospital. Pink locker room for the visitors. Let's throw some Busch Light in there that is carrying on its own tradition. We know how to bring a game on!! Proud to be a Hawkeye fan!!,I remember the days before Hayden Fry. Some of those years were pretty sad but still was a fan. Go Hawks!,It's beautiful! Everyone is in this together -\-\ Hawkeye Brotherhood!

Hawks",Great game!,a #3 against a #4 should be this close.. .. a Great win For our Young Men!,Great job Hawks!,All you Psu haters….if I was an Iowa fan. I would not be so confident. I’m a Psu fan but just speaking as a peer. If you watched the fn game. Psu was the much better team. Iowa needed a lot of help to get it done. With Clifford playing it’s a done deal. Psu would’ve won by a lot,My body may be in Florida::: but my heart was certainly in Iowa City today..I am a happy Hawkeye😀,These two teams don’t have a century of history playing one another::: the two states don’t share a border and while they’re in the same conference they’re in different divisions. Nevertheless the rivalry between Penn State and Iowa has become something to behold over the past 20 or so years. I’m very glad Iowa won but I really respect Penn State.,Looks to me like the qb wasn't the only injury for penn state! They seemed to fall down when Iowa had the momentum going! Bring on Purdue!,Way to Go Hawks!,Whew. I enjoyed it on TV. I'm an alum from the late 1960s. They didn't win in football then. So fun to see them win.,Great game 🖤💛🏈,And 83 degrees!

50 years ago::: two University of Iowa students set out on an amateur cave diving trip::: and returned having discovered Coldwater Cave::: the largest and longest cave in the upper Midwest. https://bit.ly/3ibbVtB,2021-10-05 17:25:00,I was so glad to see this article. I meant Dave and was honored to be with them when they installed the gate at the entrance to the cave.,Real life example of having nerves of steel::: exploring uncharted underwater caves 50 years back - respect!,I also got to climb down the ladder into this cave when I was a geology student. It was quite the experience!,Wow::: great article and IPTV video! I grew up in NE Iowa and never knew this cave existed!,Between the trips we took for Intro to Geology with Dr. Baker and the Iowa Mountaineers trips::: stories like this bring back great memories of my undergrad days in the early 80s!,One time my grandad swore he went into cold water cave. He said it was like walking into a New York ulsubway tunnel without the train cars. I said granddaddy you were once arrested for trespassing in the NY subway back in ‘78 you’ve never been in a cave. He says ‘sonny you’re right::: but one can spelunk in ones dreams as Kierkegaard would say.”,Steve knew these guys while at Iowa. When I worked for Governor Bob Ray for Natural Resources::: I got the State Geologist to take us down the drilled 30” shaft to enter the cave. We spent 5 hours down there enjoying the sights. 🎉👍🏽❤️,I have ALWAYS wanted to be able to go down into the cave. Sigh...,I will be making my second trip into the cave next weekend. Very excited.,As a UI Geology Graduate (MS1991) I had the opportunity to visit Coldwater Cave in February 1991 with one of my fellow UI Geology graduate students.

They were a real handful today for the Hawks .",Awesome win and it was a tough game that the offense can learn from and the defense too. Now on to Maryland Friday night on FS1!!!!,Bravo! In my opinion::: the sign of a good team is when they still win despite having a substandard performance. That was Iowa today!,10 straight wins. Extended defensive streak of holding opponents to under 25 points to I think 26 straight now. Offense showed a little improvement. Maryland next.,Tough game for the Offense! These ARE the games to learn from!!!,Thank goodness they came around in the 2nd half! Offense needs to get much better. Thank you defense 👍,WAY to go HAWKEYES ! !,Iowa State lost a tough one,I mean I'm glad we got the win but there were some absolutely BS calls today. They never should have called pass interference on CSU it wasn't receivable to begin with...

I think the story of this season is if those strengths will carry the team in conference play. It's easy to blame the quarterback::: but the more I watch this team I think the biggest problem with the defense is the young offensive line. No seniors::: two sophomores and one freshman in the middle of the line. I can only hope that things will get better as the line gains experience over the course of the season.,The offense better wake up. Real football teams are about to show up. Defense played solid.

At more than 100 years old::: University of Iowa radio station WSUI is one of the oldest continuously operating radio stations in the U.S. and considered the first educational radio station west of the Mississippi. http://spr.ly/6018yMOls,2021-09-19 12:00:00,Wow! While reaching the history of the James A Beck House I found this in the Fairfield Ledger Feb 13::: 1925. Where the house gets a radio specially so the town can hear one of the broadcasts,First heard Prairie Home Companion on WSUI before the show went national. “Jazz and Jim” with the great Jim Dougherty was also a favorite.,The program,Another coincidence for me. I attended the University of Wichita which became Wichita State University by the time I graduated. During that time a very good basketball coach put WSU on the recognition map. Colors for WSU were gold & black. Without knowing particulars::: I applied to take a Master of Arts at the University of Iowa 3 years later. University colors were Gold & Black. The WSU basketball coach moved to U of Iowa doing what he’d done at WSU. Now I find out the first 3 letters of the U of I radio was WSU…go figure.,They played good music in the early 80's,A radio station starting with W west of the Mississippi?,Noon meant Stardust and Rhythm Rambles on WSUI for many years. Still miss it!,I want to sell More than 100 years,So with all that history and the large fan base::: why is it that Iowa’s Regent Universities defunded IPR?,Had a fellowship 69-71,Andrew Christensen,💛🖤💛🖤💛🖤💛🖤,♥♥♥,"Wonder if WSUI broadcasting the day Pearl Harbor was attacked. This year the 80th Anniversary of the attack. My Mother 85 years old in 2015 stated. ""December 7::: 1941.

Game days are better when you win. Iowa: 30::: Kent State: 7.,2021-09-18 17:43:00,Petras is never gonna be a good qb! We have the 2 or third worst qb in the Big Ten. I wish they would let the other qb’s at least get some game experience. When we get to conference play::: the will load the box”AGAIN” this year::: and dare us to throw down the field.,A win is a win but terrible play calling by Brian and even worse execution by the quarterback. Thank God for the defense and running backs. It worked again Kent St but it won't work against too many other teams.,A win is a win and somehow the Hawks covered the point spread. As always the defense and punting were excellent. But::: other than Goodson::: the offense was uninspired. Petras overthrows too many receivers when he throws more than 10 yards down the field. The fumbles and sloppy penalties didn't help. Although Kent State is actually a decent team (favored to win the Western Division in the MAC) I wonder if it's a matter of playing to the level of the competition?,Benson's superman onto the dog pile with the safety cracked me up🤣 Lucky he didn't get a flag::: he was late to the party::: but it was hilarious! #go44! 💛🏈🖤,The safety is my favorite part of the game- Go Hawks 💛🖤,Awesome game so proud of you guys👍🖤💛❤️,Awesome game.

Today::: 20 years later::: we pause to reflect and remember 9/11.,2021-09-11 11:00:00,I was a college freshman at Iowa 20 years ago today. I remember that day vividly and will never forget.,So sad and so hard to view it that way. I visited there.,"I was a freshman that day::: walked to Rhetoric class and heard the news. We were told to go home. I spent the rest of the day in shock glued to the tv in my dorm room at Burge. Any innocence left of how terrible people could be was lost::: but the unity shown after still gives me hope.

🇺🇸 #NeverForget",Pele Waddilove,Whoever manages this page::: thanks for taking some time make a small 9/11 tribute post instead of just focusing on today's big game. #NeverForget & shout out to all first responders - past and present... Heroes. Go Hawks!,It was a big desaster::: always i remember it:::,Maria Dominguez,She thought all the wars were over? Huh.,"Top Fan

Deborah Smith’s life changed in the blink of an eye the summer after her first year at the University of Iowa. A tragic accident left her needing assistive devices to walk.

“The Father of Space Science” James Van Allen led Iowa in earning recognition as a world leader in space research. Click through the photos to learn more about the scientist whose impact on space and at Iowa is still felt today. https://bit.ly/3k4i1fu,2021-08-25 17:25:00,I taught at “The new school” in Mt. Pleasant IA. A naming contest was held::: and it was named Van Allen elementary school in his honor.,I had the pleasure of meeting him while in school! We were playing frisbee in the physics building late at night - and apparently disturbed him. He invited us into his office and showed us around - all kinds of developmental space hardware. I had also seen him speak at Tau Beta Pi functions (eng honors organization). He was a cool guy,I took his class at Iowa::: he was a wonderful teacher and a very humble person. He and his wife would eat Sunday dinners in the school cafeteria with students. He would always put a joke up at the end of his lectures. I really liked him::: he was so smart and yet so humble.,I took an Intro to Astronomy class which was his only undergraduate class that he taught. Three times each week he lectured. He discussed how he was working on Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 and what information he wanted to collect on those missions. He was a brilliant individual.,In 1975::: when I started grad school::: Professor Van Allen was in the airport limo I took from the Cedar Rapids Airport to Iowa City. It was a great start to my time at Iowa.,I never officially met him but he taught a class in the same room just before my class. He was always staying after answering any questions students had.,I met him and his family - all friendly and down to earth::: even though he and the Van Allen Belt were big news::: when I was an undergraduate.,It was an absolute pleasure working at The Department of Physics and Astronomy. Dr. VanAllen is so down to earth in spite of his great fame.,I met him occasionally when picking up my future(now ex) wife Barb. She had a work study job in his office our junior year,I “met” Dr. Van Allen by chance in about 1992 in the Eagles grocery store on I believe it was North Dodge. We were both looking at crackers. Of course::: there were a multitude of them in front of us and we were both sort of perplexed in our indecision. He greeted me kindly and said “We clearly have too many choices.“ And then he laughed. I don’t think he had any idea that I knew who he was. I was kind of awestruck.,They named our grade school after him in the year 1964 when it was built ::::::::::::and I guess his name is not offensive because they have never changed the name after all these years ::::::,Yes::: and also visit the building at ISU which shows the invention of the computer!,He was from my home town and one of our elementary schools is named after him!!!!,"The "" Van Allen"" Belt bears his name. I was High School Scholar in Iowa when this happening!!!",I’ve heard he was a very humble man! ❤️,I still say every time a rocket goes up::: momentarily breaking the radiation belt::: we get crazy weather.,I remember him when I was at Iowa though I never took a class with him. I ended up working with his brother at Pfizer headquarters in Manhattan.,I remember one time my grandad told me about how he was walking past this building in Iowa city in the 1950s and this guy comes running out and yells “I need help! I am about to finish my work on charged particles surrounding the earth::: but I can’t figure out what shape they are as my trousers keep falling down!” Now my grandad was a salt of the earth Iowan who 9 times out of 10 wore suspenders::: but on that fateful day he was wearing an old leather belt he got while visiting his folks in South Dakota (a story for another time!) and he looked back at the man::: who was holding up his slacks while trying to open the door. My grandad ran over and said “it’s alright there you ol rascal::: you can have my belt.” The man exclaimed::: “Belt? Did you say belt? Eureka! They are radiation belts! Of course!” And by golly that man ran off right out of his pants leaving them on the sidewalk. Now my grandad was born in a sod house and never threw away good pants. well he picked them up and wore those trousers until they went out of fashion with the bell bottom fad. The way he told the story it led me to believe he met Van Allen himself::: but we may never know. Grandad was buried in those pants though,Hubby had a class of his but alas I was not a real science guy::: just political 😉. FYI if I had a do-over::: I’d be a Geologist 👍🏽😎 🪨,"I met him in 1978 when I was still in high school. We chatted with him after the lecture in the Physics Building (it was later named after him) and then invited him to go to Baskin-Robbins.
I don't remember what he had (I had pralines and cream) but he was a very cool guy and very humble.",I had the pleasure of interviewing Jim in 2001::: his niece also babysat my son.,Was Halsey Gym named after his wife?,He was my teacher in the 70s,Loved his Shooting The Moon lecture you could slip in to in the early 70s!,Under grad at Iowa Wesleyan!,Yeah::: well I road a Murray bike,"I will never forget how Dr Van Allen helped spark my lifelong enthusiasm for science and stoked my curiosity that has served me Very well through my entire life.

In 8th grade::: in my small school::: we had a year long large (for me at the time a seemingly insurmountable mountain) project. I was struggling with sources for my subject - NASA. Our library was inadequate for this and this was Loooong before the internet.

So being the direct man he was::: my father rang the university and happened to get to talk to ""someone"". Dad explained my consternation and asked for help.

Not more than a week later BOXES began showing up. Dozens of scientific journals::: publications::: picture of the Viking missions. More than I could have used in 2 years :)

I asked who exactly had my father talked to - van somebody?!? I looked at the return label and was dumbfounded when the return addresses were all James Van Allen.

It never hurts to ask for help- you never know when you may get the help of legends :)",I took physics and astronomy from Dr. James Van Allen. He taught entry level classes to spark interest,My roommate took his course in astronomy.,Took Astronomy 101 from Dr. Van Allen my freshman year. He was amazing!😀,"What a brilliant::: nice::: humble man!
I was in charge of the 1980 annual meeting of the International Microwave Power Institute. The meeting was always held in the home city of the president of the organization. In 1978::: it was in Monaco; in 1979 in Ottawa CN; in 1980 in Iowa City::: IA!!! One of the highlights of the meeting was an after-dinner speech by Dr. Van Allen. He spoke for about 45 minutes::: using slides and no notes. Then::: he graciously took questions from the audience. People were absolutely enthralled.... and stayed until close to 10 p.m. He wouldn't accept any compensation::: and told us what a wonderful evening he'd had!",Dan Brauhn,Interesting.,Right!,USA dead for Corona,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Class of 2025 celebrates its first Hawkeye Wave together.,2021-08-21 01:46:15,Rylee Micklevitz - you got to do your 1st wave! How was it?,Please be Healthy Hawkeyes and mask up (and get vaccinated!!) so we all do our part to keep our kids out of harm's way. Let's show these kids what it looks like to be real leaders!! #forthekids,Oooof… standing there in a large::: maskless group waving at kids who rely on people to be masked to keep them ALIVE and free of infection from COVID and other diseases… not a very supportive message to send those kids! What an awful look for U of I::: especially a teaching hospital… (Speaking as a sibling of a person who was in that treatment center for cancer for the larger part of a year…),University of Iowa Please do this for the Class of 2024 as well….not just a little event at Hubbard Park. Have it at Kinnick Stadium for the Class of 2024 as well. They missed out on so much! We paid quite a bit of money last year for just online classes!,University of Iowa when will the class of 2024 get to do this? We paid lots of money last year for things they never got to use and experience and were strung along the whole year. This is one easy thing you could do for them.,My niece::: Emma Raymond::: was in this crowd! Gives me goosebumps!,"To the people saying that these students “deserve” to stand shoulder-to-sho
ulder::: unmasked::: during a pandemic: no::: they don’t. Coming from an alumni who graduated this past May (without a “real” ceremony::: mind you)::: these students aren’t entitled to take part in a potential super-spreading
event just because they want to. It’s that exact same belief—that people are entitled to do whatever they want::: regardless of the impact it may have on others—that has prolonged this pandemic. UI’s actions for the past 1.5 years have really made me embarrassed to be a Hawkeye in so many ways.",My Granddaughter is in that waving crowd! ❤️❤️,The Class of 2024 should also be able to do this as well as any other event that is scheduled for the Class of 2024!,"Kayla Mason here it is!

As a University of Iowa Alum::: both undergraduate and graduate::: and an Iowa City native::: this is so very disappointing.

I live in Coralville with my family. I've been in that tower during a 2019 football game when my youngest was hospitalized. He was later hospitalized 4 more times in 2020 - twice on oxygen.

While I'm sure the fireworks were very cool to watch::: I can't imagine some of those kids and their parents up there appreciated the tone-deaf message this is sending. Tanya Price? Would you appreciate being waved to by a crowd of maskless kids during a pandemic while your immunocompromis
ed kiddo is in the hospital?

Now that the students are back and school is also starting::: we will begin - already started - to see levels of cases and hospitalization
s in the pediatric population that we didn't see before. Katy Kennedy::: am I overreacting here?

Please keep your negative Nancy comments to yourself. Let these poor kids live a little. Unless the masks are N95 they are pretty much worthless. Curious - were you worried about the Obama birthday party and no masks?Worried about the open borders and the Covid positive people this administration is flying all over the country on the taxpayers dime? Congratulations
to the Hawkeye Class of 2025::: make us proud!","James Halman II My kid is at Iowa (Stead Family Children's Hospital) over and over again. That's why I worry about it and that's why I think the concept of a group of hundreds of maskless students participating in the wave goes against everything the wave itself stands for. To be clear::: I'm talking about the wave::: nothing else.

I can never be able to put into words how helpless it feels as a parent to watch your child have to fight so hard to do something as simple as breathe (not to mention worrying about other underlying concerns to complicate matters).

I also know how much The Wave means to children and families at the hospital. For many families in that hospital::: the days are long and we often felt invisible - like we were stuck in this horrible situation but the rest of the world just went on outside that tower. The Wave lets families and children be seen::: acknowledged. To do The Wave at this event::: an event that increases the risk of Covid spreading in one of the communities patients at the children's hospital live in...it's beyond demoralizing and quite frankly a slap in the face to many::: many families in there.",STOP! Please::: just STOP! Everyone has different opinions and if you want to talk COVID-19 or Mask wearing please go to the other site.

"Dear First-year Hawkeyes: If there’s anything we’ve learned over the last year and a half::: it’s that we don’t know what will happen next and it’s important to be grateful for what we have now.

As you move into your new home away from home and anticipate the next chapter of your lives::: take a moment to appreciate the emotions that your parents and family might be feeling.

While they’re recounting your biggest milestones and are so proud of you::: they’re also remembering the family movie nights::: morning greetings::: and supporting you at all your school events. They’re thinking about your empty chair at the dinner table and fearing how quiet it will be at home.

So::: when you move in tomorrow and your mom wants to unpack your clothes and make your bed::: let her. When your dad wants to introduce himself to all the people on your floor::: let him. When they want to take a million pictures::: keep smiling bright.

Take a moment to reflect on everything they’ve done to help get you to this moment. As you start this new chapter of your life::: remember they are also starting a new chapter of theirs. And when it’s time to say “goodbye:::” hug them a little longer and tighter.

Welcome to the Hawkeye family.",2021-08-15 12:00:00,I was fine until I made his bed and flashed on a memory of making up his basinette. I held it together::: but allowed myself to make that bed despite his protests and remember with love so many milestones only a mother would know.,Thank you from a parent who’s about to drop off her firstborn to Iowa city🙏 You captured the emotions so very well and I hope this compassion and guidance for the first year Hawkeyes will continue throughout the year:-),This is soooooo well written! Kudos to this author! It should be posted in every dorm room! 🥲 (And I don’t even have any kids but remember way back when!),This speaks to Nick and the Lemke family today as they move Nick into his dorm.,This is beautiful! I remember the day you brought him home. He has grown into an amazing man! Learn lots Ben and enjoy college life! 😊❤,🥺🥺🥺 who ever wrote this captured just what I want to say. Our move in day is Thursday. Looking forward to more great moments and memories but know this is a big jump to a new chapter in our lives ❤️…ps I’m not crying at all 😩,This is so true. Even when they are in their 30:::40::: we still worry about them and miss them.,"Beautiful sentiments::: but something was omitted that will facilitate happy reunions. Make sure the whole family is vaccinated and follows CDC masking recommendations
! Wishing all a wonderful and healthy academic year.",I remember the emotions on my part as well as those of my parents and siblings in those days in August 1981. I’m grateful for the experience over those years in that I grew so much.,This is excellent. We dropped our son off today. Good luck to all the new students and parents.,"WOW...I lived this in August of 2000::: 21 years ago. What a great memory...thanks

Hiding tears as I walked away or on the 6 hr ride home. So proud of what all three have accomplished since that day.,It doesn’t change for us when you move in year 2 and 3. Probably won’t change year 4 either (that’s next year for us) take a selfie on your first day of school (if that was a thing in your house) and send them to your mom. She will cherish sharing that day with you too. Go Hawks!,My oldest grandchild goes to college this Friday.

The heartstrings stretch all the way::: but they never break. I've done it twice a long time ago::: and it still feels the same.,I remember in 1978 when we left our daughter::: she was standing in the street as we drove away. I was crying::: she was crying. This article you wrote is just beautiful and hits the bell exactly right!!,So proud of you! Have an amazing first year,That sure hits home.. thanks for sharing💞,We are leaving a part of our hearts at U of I tomorrow.

They will think that is absolutely awesome:::,I made it all day without crying until I read this.,Yes! Take it all in & enjoy it::: but remember your parents. They are keeping on a strong face. That same face they tried to use when you took a fall::: or broke your arm::: or maybe had a frightening surgery. Inside::: or when you look away… that’s when the tears will flow. 💗them & thank them! For heaven’s sake CALL them!!! 😂 #GoHawks,Hug your mom! She is going to cry after she leaves you 💕,Gulp. I have a long drive back to DC alone.

Thank you for giving a shout out to all the parents and caring guardians that support young peoples future pursuits.

Tonight is the first-ever MLB Field of Dreams game. Learn how Hawkeye grad W.P. Kinsella's best-known story took shape at the University of Iowa and later became a Hollywood classic. https://t.co/WxyXQmP569,2021-08-12 17:55:00,Love the connection of this book with the Iowa Writer's Workshop!!,Love the movie and love the field::: and I love living in Iowa.,Thank you::: Mr. Kinsella for writing the story. I seriously have probably watched this movie at least 20 times.,Love it thank you Field of Dreams,We were just there!!,First home run of an MLB game played in Iowa was just hit by the White Sox.,Watching the game. Intro gave me goosebumps and tears when they walked out of field.,Just soooo great for our state of Iowa,IS THIS HEAVEN? NO::: IT'S IOWA,Iowa is a great place to live and using the Field of Dreams for an MLB game is perfect. Iowans have lots of good ideas and dreams and they are proud of this state.,The game tonight was amazing.,It’s really a lovely little ballpark::: and such a wonderful first. Wonder if MLB will play more games there. An annual one would be so nice.,Hope you all enjoyed the ball game from the Field of Dreams in Iowa. What fun to see a major league game played right in the middle of an Iowa corn field. If you build it they will come! Loved the drone shots and the interviews::: but especially the game when the White Soxes won on a last half of the ninth inning home run! What fun when the world seems to be full of bad news to sit and watch the first major league baseball game played in Iowa!,Very awesome with the players walking out of the cornfield just like they did in the Field of Dreams Movie 32 years ago!!!!,Great game! I hope they play more games there!,so awesome to watch made me homesick for Iowa. Is this heaven::: no it’s Iowa🤗🤗🤗🥰,So glad this finally happened. Love every bit of this game.,Great to see this actually happening! And what a way to end the game! I love Buffalo but god do I miss Iowa.,Impressive to see the players walking out of the cornfield.,Must be humid and hot in Iowa tonight all the players are dripping in sweat,"So cool!
However::: being an Iowan… I’m thinking with no fence::: the corn might taste like rubber::: cork and raw hide next year 😆","What a wonderful story! I was crying thru most of it. I love this movie. I lived in Iowa for about less than a year-\-\long enough for my son to be born in Iowa City then we moved to Michigan where I was born. But we moved back to Iowa in 1980 and stayed until 1990. I took my son to see Field of Dreams. I fell in love with it. I cried. (even then). I wasn't much of a baseball fan nor is my son but I began to like the sport thanks to a nephew of mine who sadly died in January of this year of Cancer. He was a Detroit Tigers fan and so am I. He would teach me about baseball and I learned to like watching it. But I LOVE the movie because it reminds me of the years my son and I lived in Iowa and it brings tears to my eyes all the time I watch the movie. Think I'll watch it tonight. Thank you Mr. Kinsella for writing the story and thank those who put it to action in a movie called ""Field of Dreams.""",I almost missed it::: I heard nothing about it and caught it changing channels. It was a great show::: probably the best of the summer. Can't wait for it again. Kevin Costner was wonderful and the game fantastic. Thank you for that 😊,Beautiful evening!!! Love seeing the drone shots they are showing.,Good game! Home team (W. Sox) won in a nail biter.,"I have visited this field three times.
I miss Iowa😃",But the game isn't being played on the movie field. They built another field down the road!,My favorite movie…go Sox,Nice but they are not even playing on the actual field. MLB built another field next to the real one. What a let down,When I first heard about this game I wanted to be there. Too bad I can’t be there. Maybe there will be another game in the future.,Rach and I explored the diamond a few years back. Nothing impressive.,When I student taught in Cedar Rapids::: we took a field trip here.,So cool - great place to visit if you've seen the movie!,Great place to visit. Enjoyed taking pictures. So much fun in my home state.,So cool. They will have this memory forever,"Love the movie. Love this idea. Could Iowa City and Ames play a game there?
Would be epic.","Totally enjoyable evening…perfect
game",It was Great-Perfect ending,It was beautiful! Love those Yanks! I watched on TV.,As most of you know that I grew up in Iowa. I am very sentimental. This stirs up memories of my brothers and my dad and also playing catch with my son!,What a magical night it was!,Such an amazing place to see!!!,One of the best movies ever,This is way so cool!! ❤️,My family and I just visited The Field of Dreams this past May::: amazing story!,I got emotional at the start of this. How Kevin came out. How the players came out. Wow. This really is something,It was sooo neat!,This was so cool last night!,Wait::: a writer’s name was actually kinsella???,First pitch,Can't wait to watch!,Is this heaven::: no it’s Iowa.,Kelly Yadron Madej,Yea for the Sox,Thank you for sharing!!!!,James Pepper,Phillip Tucker good read,Really great time!,That's cool,Great Movie,Loved this.💓,Wonderful show!!,Beautiful beautiful Iowa!,💛💛💛💛💛💛,Go Iowa,Susie::: have you read this story?,Go Sox,Love it,Incredible,SOX WIN!!!,Amy Kolbus Hecht ❤️,So awesome 👏,Ryan workshop,Linda McGinnis Henning Mary Hood Silva Beth Riordan Thede 💛🖤,Jon Just😊,So Cool..,This is just awesome!!,I love this game,Wonderful story❤️❤️,Duncan Monserud,Liz Michelle Pam Selby Vasquez,Y’all this brings so much to reality!!

Nearly 1 in 50 U.S. children are diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder. A new University of Iowa center focuses on autism diagnosis and intervention. https://bit.ly/2VULz7f,2021-08-09 17:25:00,As a 40 year teacher::: I’d say::: Mercury::: pesticides & older parents are factors in the increase of Autism.,Very proud of the work they do at U of I,ANOTHER GREAT MOVE FOR THE WONDERFUL UI HOSPITALS. KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK.,Is anyone concerned about this diagnosis. Why?,Why has this dx suddenly appeared. What has changed ?,Go Iowa,I been there three times,Amy Randolph Hoffman,When I was at Iowa::: I wanted to do my grad work in preschool autism. But the only school then that offered anything was Michigan. So::: no. I got married instead. Glad they are into a program now!,Thanks U of Ia. There is tremendous need.,Was this the study that linked taking ibuprofen in pregnancy to these disorders?,Morgan Williams,"#SanctionPakista
n",Gram Short,Good place,Stop giving them the MMR shot as one shot. Split that stuff up over time and watch those numbers drop,"#sanctionpakista
n",I been there six years.,The inventor of Gatorade was doing research in this area before his death. What he discovered was certain foods were contributing to a child’s autism. They changed children’s diets and over a short period of time was able to document what foods were effective and those that were not. The younger the child that was on the diet::: the more rapid and notable the change.,"Per Mayo Clinic.org::: autism is caused by a problem with brain development. It impacts how a person perceives and socializes with others causing problems in communication and social interaction. It begins in early childhood and continues::: eventually causing problems with function in society.

We're just weeks away from welcoming our newest Hawkeyes in the Class of 2025 to campus. What's one piece of advice you'd give to our newest Hawkeyes or to parents with a student leaving home for the first time?,2021-08-04 17:25:00,I started texting my daughter “Night Love You” every night the day she moved into her dorm. It is ten years later and we still do this everyday. You can never tell your kids you love them too much.,To freshman parents from the parent of a class of 2012 civil engineering grad: Breathe. Set a time for an in-person call each week - make it your son/daughter’s responsibility to reach out. Be available but step back. You don’t need to know a lot of things that they are doing Trust that you did a great job as a parent. Let your freshman shine.,Every day brings new people::: places & ideas.. put yourself out there and you will grow::: change::: & become independent. Welcome what’s ahead 😎🖤💛🌟🌀,Work hard::: do your best always and absolutely celebrate every chance you get!🎉,Make sure you hit the books and have a set time to study when you get home :::::::::Write down the time you start and end your studies and keep track of the hrs so you answer to yourself ::::::be careful of too much fun because you will flunk out ::::::its so much harder than high school :::::::::The 1st year flunks alot of students out :::::::::,Keep doing your hobbies - they’re good for your mental health. There are amazing bands::: orchestras::: club sports and more to be involved with. You don’t have to be a music major or a scholarship athlete to do something you love!!,Meet every new opportunity for adventure. At a large university like Iowa you'll have endless opportunities to try new things::: take as many of them as possible. Learning happens outside of the comfort zone-\-\and as much learning will happen outside of the classroom as it does in it.,To both parents and students::: you are welcome to this amazing place. I do have something to say to the parents. Don't you ever get embarrassed and hold back your tears when you leave your children at the dorm. Is hard but it will be so worth it for both. You will miss them back at home but the thought of seeing them and hugging them the next time you get together::: will have a special meaning. Welcome Hawkeyes!! Be extraordinary 💛🖤💛🖤💛🖤,As a parent you have to let your Hawk explore & be free. That was not easy for me. Have a plan of course because you do need to check on your kid::: but try not to smother. It’s their time::: so let them grow & become who you sent them there to be! You taught them the basics so trust that they got it! Also::: never sign anything without reading it! #OnIowa #GoHawks 🖤💛,Move in day was always stressful and chaotic::: now that I look back on it. It was fun and one of most proudest days of your life as a parent. And by the way if you are in Hillcrest::: use the other elevator than no one knows about 😜Good luck Hawkeyes🖤💛,One-way streets. Introduce yourself to them... And remember them! Other than that::: enjoy::: be safe::: and make a difference! 😍,"Manage your time! If you get your homework and studying taken care of Sunday/Monday/
Tuesday/
Wednesday night::: you’ll be ready to go out and enjoy yourself on Thursday/
Friday/
Saturday. Do 45 minutes to an hour each night Sun-Wed::: and you won’t have to cram at all::: just a little extra time right before finals/major tests.

I had way too many friends struggle and drop out in the first two semesters because of not managing their time properly.",Challenge yourself to step out of your comfort zone. High school is over::: you have a chance to be the person you want to be::: to have the identity you want that can set you up for the rest of your life. Join clubs::: try out different groups::: take classes that you think are interesting even if they’re not on your degree track. Experience and explore while enjoying the safety that college provides.,"Parents—prepare
to make a Walmart run after you think you and they have thought of everything. Once you’re settling them in the room::: you’ll discover you need—something.
...And prepare to make a Walmart run (of course::: you’ll ALWAYS pay) every time you visit. AND....it’s ok to be both relieved and grieved at the nest-leaving.",I remember moving in Currier Hall fall of 1998. So many fun memories and people. #letsgohawks,Students::: your classes are only one area of learning. Do the work::: but allow yourself the wonderful opportunity to explore new and different topics as well the ability to make friends from so many different cultures.,Get vaccinated and encourage all your family and friends to do the same. Designate study time and “fun” time. Be kind to everyone.,You don’t have to be Greek to have friends. In fact i highly suggest waiting until sophomore year to rush because you change so much your first year,My dad wrote me a note as I was the first child in our whole family to go to college... And hid it in my luggage.... I found it after I was by myself. I still have it. Knowing I had their support 5 hours away meant the world to me! And when I was feeling a little homesick... It happens and it's ok ... I read it and felt better most times 😄,"Parents-First of all::: one of the easiest move ins ever. The kids were helpful. Second-Let your baby shine!! This is what you raised them to do. They will love it there. Third-Don’t miss parent weekend-some of our greatest memories were made that weekend.
Kids-One and only-call your parents!! Check in!!! They just need to know you’re alright. 💛🖤💛🖤💛🖤 Oh and let them help set up your room and make your bed! Moms love doing that kind of stuff.

Enjoy being a Hawkeye!,Focus on studies but also have fun time. Meet as many people as you can. Have a GREAT time. Loved my Hawkeye years!,From a 21-year university professor and Iowa alum (me) to new freshmen: Go to your classes - don't skip them!! And please::: ask your professors for help early on if you don't understand something. They are there for YOU and want to help you succeed. If you don't ask for help::: they assume you understand the material. Relax and take everything one step at a time. Lastly::: get involved in one non-academic activity such as band::: orchestra::: choir::: so forth. It's a great stress reliever. Best wishes and have a fantastic year!!!! GO HAWKS!! 🖤💛,Work hard::: get involved on campus::: and call your mom every once in awhile!,Enjoy this new life experience as it will be gone sooner than you think!!,"I never had more than a suitcase::: pillow and blanket/
sheets. Oh and a desk lamp borrowed from my brother when he was at Iowa 10 years earlier. Do these kids really need all that crap?",Try things that are unfamiliar. Don’t just room with someone from high school - interact with classmates from other parts of the state and other states and countries. Learn another language. Use your core courses or gen ed courses to see what truly interests you.,Do whatever you to keep the lines of communication open between you and your child.,"As an alumnus and resident of the Iowa City area::: please get the vaccine and be safe. I don't want my city to have to impose restrictions because of temporary residents irresponsibilit
y. Oh::: and go to Studio13 and TIP YOUR QUEENS.","Be compassionate. Be kind.

Have fun! Take advantage of your education learning opportunities. You are paying for this.",Put in the time and effort to study make a plan and stick to it.

Explore early and make friends 😊 Go Hawkeyes 👏👏,Everything will be just fine::: give life time to settle down. Get involved and learn about the world around you.,"Students: find a favorite study spot on campus and get to know your best study hours when it's available; the law library has gloriously large tables where you can spread out of needed. 2nd::: invest in fleece face coverings for those cold February walks across the river to get to a distant class.
Parents: provide your kids with enough space to sort through some answers on their own; pushing to stay too involved too often actually signals you don't trust them or your parenting of them. 2nd::: a thoughtful care package from home covers over a ton of homesickness!👍🏻",Make sure your front door is always open.,Get them an Uber or Lyft gift card.,i have been to the stadium does that make me an honorary hawkeye lol,You will be part of the Hawkeye family always.

mail.com",My husband Dan is glad he went there for two years!!,This good but we can do better. The University of Iowa must be among the top 50 world wide and not among the top 150 only. To compete at the international level you need leadership with international experience. The trend of choosing similar leadership throughout the years is not enough and will not take us beyond where we are. You need more diversity and more leadership who has experience in higher education at the international level. The search committees for the Leadership head hunting need major shift away from the traditional choices and the limited pools to choose from. I have received three degrees from this university which I care about but major strategic decisions are needed.

Friends: The Reunion made its debut today. Did you know Calvin Hall was featured in a Season 10 episode of the popular tv show::: Friends?,2021-05-27 17:25:00,There were several shots of UI campus on the tv show Coach back in the 90's. The head coach was loosely based on Hayden Fry.,This is brand new information!!!,Who knows ? I might of been on friends then.,Oh yes::: going to Calvin Hall and being thankful that I didn’t have to walk ALL the way down the hill (because walking ALL the way down meant I had to walk ALL the way back up). Also stopping by to pick up the course catalog for the semester from one of the many rows of cardboard boxes full.,I was walking to class and was asked to be an extra in a tv clip for the tv show Coach. All I did was walk in the building 😎 I think my 2 second shot ended up on the production floor. I also remember registering for class during the winter and biffing it on the ice on my way out and ripped my jeans in front of a ton of kids waiting in line…I am sure I went right to the Airliner or Joe’s to drown my sorrows of the embarrassment. There is no other place like Iowa City! Go Hawks!🖤💛🖤💛,I was there in 1987. I remember these stairs well during registration. These photos bring back nice memories. We all miss our time in Iowa City. Less responsibility and more free time and yes many dreams.,Up and down these steps many times! Loved the University of Iowa and still do ! Go Hawkeyes !,"Oh yeah....waiting
in line to go inside Calvin Hall during the last couple of weeks in Nov/Dec to register for classes. Can we say ""BRRRRRRRRR?"" I remember a few new friends I met that way and we swapped to go buy coffee while we waited.",There is no way I’ll waste a picosecond of my life watching one of the most horrible and unfunny TV shows ever made (Seinfeld is a close 2nd from that time period in terms of being flat out awful).,I remember walking down those steps in the 1980s and 1990s. I was so elated that I just successfully registered for another semester and got the classes that I wanted. Also::: I had just applied for financial aid that would be forthcoming.,I was almost there in 1987::: graduated in December of 1986. Good times and no I didn’t know about Friends.,Many fond memories of Calvin Hall while working as a student receptionist in the OSFA in 1987-90!,Got this bad boy there. I also looked 10 years old in my freshman year of college::: 2002.,I worked in Calvin Hall at Financial Aid Office during college.,This is cool but when will we recognize that Currier Hall was in Gilmore Girls,Yes::: I did! When I first saw it::: I thought::: “Wait a minute. I know that place!”,Kinda fun... 34 years apart. Top photo from when I was a senior at Iowa. Bottom photo from when my daughter IS a senior at Iowa! 🖤💛🖤💛,It looks so much different with the tree shading the building!,“Coach” had shots of Quad or Hillcrest at start of each episode,"I was there from there back in the 80’s from ‘82 thru ‘87 and remember getting my GSLoan which I called Guaranteed Student Motorcycle 💵 🏍 GSM Lol
‘85 Yamaha 550 maxim
Go Calvin n go Hawks!💥",I was actually there in fall of ‘87!,How did I not know that! I was even at Iowa during season 10,I worked there at the Financial Aid office.,Love this Campus!,Which episode in season 10?,I think back in the 60’s potential employers did on campus interviews there.,I didn't know that...wow! Ah::: the days of Calvin Hall.,Bailey Graham probably the most consistent fact I gave for every tour as a tour guide,I did not know that. One of my favorite shows ever.,Getting the new semester sticker on the coolest ID made.,Mid ‘80’s - standing in line to register - big sheets of paper on the wall showing classes - just about to the head of the line and 2 of the classes you need get crossed off the available list #goodtimes,Nope sorry i was born that year,How many know Calvin Hall used to be on the Pentacrest?,I worked there in the Admissions Office part-time while I was in college. Part of my job was giving campus walking tours.,Becky Maher-Jacobson,Maybe they meant 1997. Friends was on in the 90's; not 80's.,Sydney Singh,I am coming insaallah after 2 years,Alex S Courtney,Kristina Peterson Lucas Julie Ryba. Kim Rich. Sandy Travis Raike. Margaret Ashton Pardini,Ashleigh Austin Blake T Austin,Katelyn Schechinger go hawks,Marcy Hind 😯,Blaine Zern,Kelly Smith,Alli Fuller Anderson,Now I have to watch that Friends episode!! Girls on HBO also taped at Iowa while Hannah attended The Writer’s Workshop! One of the lines we used to quote “There’s a party on Linn Street!”,No::: I did not know that!,Karen,The grass is still dead::: nice,Andy Myers,Kelly Braudis ooooo,Claire Hookom,Devin Irene Early,...,Alyssa Welling wtf,WHAT A BEAUTIFUL BUILDING!,Vivi Ana Liit,Tiara Walz::: who knew?!,Amy & Hannah,Did not know that!!,Johann Fry.

Not an experimental drug that we ha e no idea what the long term effects will be. Plus she had it so she has antigens that protect her more than this drug will. Be ready to be told you need this vaccine again in 6 months. We do not have a pandemic now and the 99.8% recovery from Covid is greater than. The protection from this vaccine. Amazing you think the government gives a dam.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Last June::: University of Iowa researchers were some of the first researchers to publish a study analyzing a mask mandate’s effectiveness. Now::: the study is recognized as one of the most shared studies of all time. https://bit.ly/3a76cky,2021-04-13 22:30:01,My great uncle and Grandfather were All Americans in football ::: my Uncle George was the subject of Grant Woods last painting Spring in Town as Grandma and Grandpa lived next door to Mr Wood at 1154 E Court St and my Dad mowed Mr Woods yard and shared several bowls of ice cream after that while discussing issues. My blood indeed bleeds black and gold.,Science once again proves the Republicans and Trumpistas are dead wrong. Emphasis on dead.,still questioning Y states like FL have fewer cases than states w a mask mandate?,Too bad the governor didn’t read it.,Don’t publicize this::: the Iowa legislature will close your doors.,😀,So how about you use that knowledge of masks and hold a safe::: masked graduation ceremony in Kinnick for the students and their families who deserve it?,Hawk smarts!,"Sure well I live in Florida::: and now we have Texas and other states with no mask mandates and real life results don’t align with this peer reviewed study.

When can we expect a follow up with updated data that reflects this? Even in Texas despite a crisis at the border and thousands of illegals pouring in who could be bringing in new cases the numbers continue to fall::: despite Texas not having a mask mandate for over a month now.

Also we have the Danish mask study::: and Sweden as a control group that contradicts the study as well.",Hawkeye Sparkles,My school ❤️,All time?,Masks work. Governors ignore.,"Mask mandates either work::: or they don't work::: according to which ""expert"" you happen to be listening to. Personally::: I don't think masks do very much to the spread of Covid. Since it is a airborne virus::: your going to get it::: mask::: or no mask. Wear a mask::: don't wear a mask. It's your choice.",I like ♥♥♥lowa,"What BS!
When your idiot students refuse to wear masks as well as major Drs offices!

Stop spreading your BS propaganda to try to make the world think you are even close to the quality of John Hopkins and other far superior places!

Duke Slater was selected into the NFL Hall of Fame. He was recognized as Iowa’s first black First Team All-American in 1921. After earning a bachelor’s degree::: Slater played in the NFL for 10 years and also completed a law degree at Iowa. He had an extremely successful professional career and continued to break down barriers when he became the first black judge to serve on the Superior Court of Chicago in 1960. Slater Residence Hall bears his name::: though it is documented that like other black students::: he was not allowed to live in university housing and endured other forms of racism during his time at Iowa. https://magazine.foriowa.org/story.php?ed=true&storyid=1880,2021-02-10 23:30:00,How about naming the field at Kinnick Stadium::: Duke Slater Field! It would be awesome to play football on a field in his name.,Photos of Duke here in the hospital in Atlantic,Can someone at the university please tell me when black applicants were finally admitted to Iowa equally as white students::: and what year they were allowed to live in on-campus housing? I would also be curious to know what year students who had asked to be randomly matched with another roommate were matched without consideration to the students’ race.,Duke Slater field at Kinnick Stadium,Lived for a year in the hall bearing his name. Hail Duke.,Great tribute and appreciated reminder during Black History Month.,"When ""men were men""!",Great man and athlete !,Proud to have lived in Slater Hall! 🖤💛,I lived in Slater..did not realize this,Interesting and sad post.

The campus community said ‘farewell’ to Seashore Hall::: a longtime multipurpose building that served as the university’s first teaching hospital. https://bit.ly/3a1k13s,2021-02-05 20:30:00,A family with a great social science tradition. I did my PhD under Karen Seashore::: Carl Seashore’s great niece::: at the University of Minnesota. I now teach in the Carver College of Medicine. All things come around! 💛🖤,The Ed/Psych library was in this building in the 60’s. My sister worked there and I took some psychology courses there too.,Any other photos of Seashore through the years? It would be nice to view it's transformation online.,Sadly::: it was time. I had one class in Seashore.,I remember it as East Hall when I attended- worked at the Audio Visual Department 67-69,I have always been so very proud to have my BSN from the U. of Iowa. Being a student there and then working there set me up beautifully for the rest of my life. The place was and is so beautifully organized and oriented toward serving the broad community. I loved the Hospital Patient Taxis that went all over Iowa. Not to mention the utter brilliance that comes out of there!!!,I spent many hours in those hallowed halls::: attaining both my MA and PhD in Sociology under the tutelage of excellent professors!,I fondly remember doing research in the Sociology Library in Seashore Hall one summer when I was in Iowa City as a visiting undergraduate (from Wartburg College).....,Farewell indeed! As a TA I had an office at Seashore Hall that I shared for office hours.,Fortunately the outstanding healthcare tradition endures.,So many memories there. Sad to see it go. Historic preservation never was much of a priority in Iowa City.,Housed the School of Journalism when I attended (97-99).,I'm upset I never got a chance to go to the top floor where the surgery suite was. In the early days the hospital would have all the students in stadium seating looking over someone performing surgery in the center of the room...so sterile I know lol,what a shame such a piece of history of iowa medicine,So sad to see it go. My grandpa was born there. I spent a lot of my years in college there for my psych and social work classes. So much history,Sad. I really hope they start preserving historic buildings more proactively. It’s one of the things that make the campus beautiful and amazing!,I believe it had the first or one of the first sound proof chambers Seashore used for his hearing experiments and studies. He also designed and built one of the first audiometers.,My last two years as a poli sci grad student - 96 and 97 - were spent in Seashore Hall while the Liberal Arts building was renovated...,I took a handful of courses there for sociology::: history::: etc. It wasnt the most well maintained building on campus but hate to lose a piece of history like that!,I took many classes at Seashore Hall. I never know why it was named Seashore.,"My worst ""commute"" ever during my 4.5 years at UI was EPB to Seashore::: I think I had 15 minutes between classes.",I spent 4 years in Seashore hall from 82-86 taking Psychology classes.,Many classes there and the occasional evening spent on the roof. 😂,She sells sea shells by the Seashore Hall,My in-laws met and fell in love in Seashore Hall!,Jeff Hesse ::: remember Soc. class with Jeff Moe in that building?🤣 Pretty sure I have a pic of you in front of it::: too! Great memories @ UI '84-'89.😁,Much later::: I had a psych class in that building.,Each therapy grad::: many classes in those halls.,What are they planning for the site?,Love the history and the pics.,Here’s some pictures we captured in the weeks it came down 😢,When I had classes there::: it was East Hall,There used to be an enormous magnolia tree in the alcove in the right side of the building. The fragrance was remarkable. I grew up about two blocks from these buildings!,I had a class on East Hall!! I also had Western Civ discussion in a quansit hut!!,Sorry to see that history go !,Farewell Seashore! I had all my Sociology classes there. 😢,I think I attended sociology class there in 1990.,I took several classes in the building.,Did anyone find my lost pen? I think it was behind a radiator. Great pen.,Beth Riordan Thede Linda McGinnis Henning Colleen Martin Peterson I remember this building although I never had a class there.,Angelique Johnston remember that psych class we had here::: second floor::: fire escape door in the room?,😢😢,Kerry Soule,rip,Stacy Sturdevant,Ah::: ys::: i remember it well.,Seashore is gone??? 😞,Tatyana Guy how cool?!,Gabby Garcia,Deanne Tadlock,That building was awful.,Kwesi::: how do you feel about this ;),"https://

On the other side of the world:
Road Policing Command Assistant Commissioner Libby Murphy said....Concern
ing behaviours such as speeding were over-represente
d in 2020::: she said::: describing the number of cars travelling over 145km/h as “staggering”::: in part because there were fewer cars on the road due to the state’s 112-day lockdown.

Hawkeye Football is going bowling! The Hawkeyes will play in the Music City Bowl against the Missouri Tigers on December 30. Go Hawks!!,2020-12-20 21:54:54,Love it but I am torn since these are my two favorite teams. Never want either to loose. Well crap now I'll have to choose. I guess since I have been a Hawkeye fan since back in the 60's became a Mizzou fan in the 80's so it's GO HAWKS! Win it for Bump and Hayden they are watching!,Go Hawks! Ring in 2021 with a BIG win over the Tigers In Nashville!! 🥂🎉🎊🏈,"Let’s go Hawkeyes. Great season so far. End it with a win 🏈congratulations
on your bowl bid #musiccityusa#nashville",Lame bowl::: lame team...how far we have fallen with the current coaching team.,Sounds like fun to me....MIZ ZOU!! Let’s all enjoy a football game.,I follow both the Hawks and the Tigers. I love when they get the chance to play each other. My alma mater is Mizzou.,This is a weird year::: it’s a weird bowl::: it is what it is. The only thing I think is disappointing is the location - Nashville is great::: but it’s not warm. But ..... whatever. I really don’t think Iowa should go to a bowl game at all. It was a good enough season - the last 5 games looked pretty good. Let’s leave it there - with a healthy team. Let’s move on to basketball now. That’ll be exciting::: too::: and hopefully next year we will be in a good place for all of our “crowd” activities.,Stay healthy without the virus Hawkeyes so you can continue to play. Be appreciative that we have a bowl to participate in. There are teams not so lucky......,Bragging rights for another 10 years over my neighbors here in Missouri,All of you complaining about the quality of bowl and the caliber of the team we're lined up to play should just be damn thankful our guys have stayed healthy as long as they have to be in the game this far. Sure::: it would be nice to play in a New Years Day game::: but::: why don't you just be satisfied with this invitation::: support the team::: and hope we can come back next year without the hassles that this year has brought!! Go Hawks!,My husband is a Mizzou alum and I live in Columbia::: MO. This should be a good game.,Go Hawkeyes! So fun! Excited for this matchup-my daughter is a Mizzou alum 🖤💛,Its a bowl. Could be worse. They could all have Covid-19. They could bow out like Nebraska or they they could be in the cold in December. Nashville isn't that bad. My in-laws live there. I can have free lodging,Not the game we wanted::: but GRATEFUL for our team’s health and opportunity to play. Also—this Dirty Dancing reenactment photo is everything! 😍💛🖤. Go Hawks!!!,Happy for the Hawks! Now be smart and safe! (Both teams!) Let's have full rosters for the game and not let Covid crap cancel it or leave some players at home.,Playing our southern neighbor should be good !,Great location::: great game!,This might be the least appealing bowl game that I can think of. A 5-5 team? Seriously? Should have had an Iowa vs Iowa State matchup in a bowl. That would have been intriguing. I could miss watching this game::: and it wouldn’t bother me at all. 😂,At least model a “mask on” behavior for your students.,"Everyone just quit complaining....
did you think after our 0-2 start we would even be in a bowl game??? No you were too busy bitching about Ferentz and what a crappy job he has done. Geez...get s life!",Just happy football is being played. Go Hawks. ❤️,A disappointing bid::: to say the least.,Come on::: be positive::: be happy we are in a Bowl game::: GO HAWKS,A bowl is a bowl and one more chance to watch some Hawkeye football this year! Hell yeah I’ll take it! Go Hawkeyes!!!,It’s a five/ five season! We get better and deserve better but go with what you got and go put winners not whiners!,Yay more football! Go Hawks!,Seriously?! They deserve a much better bowl than that!,Look out Nashville! Go Hawks!,Go::: Hawks - Beat Missouri!! 🖤💛🏈,That will be a match up!😳,Go Hawkeyes!!! Let's beat those Tigers!!!,"What happened Outback Bowl....
Seriously bad selection",How about the Corn Bowl. Iowa and Iowa State. I'd be up for that.,Oh no! We will be a house divided!!,Al this bullshit caused by the flu. God knows in years past we never canceled bowl games because a 20 year old had the flu. Go pound sand.,BS losses to two teams we should have beat!,where is this bowl game never heard of it,After 0-2 start no one thought there was a chance to go anywhere. Happy that they finished so strong. Looking very forward to next year.,9-2 Army wasn’t picked,Considering the start to the season and how they rallied back. Be thankful.,"Congratulations
too the Hawkeyes .!!",Almost the time of their lives?,I bet the players will nope out of this. 5-5? That's insulting.,Nashville has kinda been on my bucket list.,Is this a scene from Dirty Dancing? 🤔😉,Fans allowed to attend??,"""I've had the time of my life!""
🎉🏈🖤🏟️💛🏈🎉",I see a contact extension coming.,Nobody puts baby in the corner!,We’ll take it! Yay!,hey do. u guys. know. what. time thety play on. tv on. December 30,Dirty dancing 🕺,Who care! Missouri::: a 5 and 5 Team!,Is Covid Over?,Dirty Dancing?,Nobody puts baby in the corner. Lol,"Book a discounted all-suite hotel while you visit! https://bit.ly/

But sorry still not sold
First a normal vaccine takes years to make and test. We are still in the testing faze
Second they have stated that by March 100 million will be shipped. There are 300 million people in the United states and billions world wide. Its going to probably be the end of 2021 before we all get it . It's going to first responders first.

Did I mention we are still in the trial faze

We will need a second shot that will take longer

Also doctors and medical experts have stated we will most likely be wearing masks and social distancing into 2022",May the odds forever be in your favor!! 🤷‍♂️,🙏🏻🙏🏻,Kathy Heim,Woo hoo! Go Iowa!,Hard to believe so many willing to be Lab rats,So how are the people behind that had the shot doing right now???,LOVE.,Heather Rose,Anthony Chavez,Andrew Motley,Ron Highland,👏👏💛🖤,good,Thank you.

The back flip maybe should not have been done due to his injury::: but awesome win!!🖤💛🖤💛,Hawks are flipping awesome. Great win. About time we beat Wiskey.,Tough to beat quality team/program at Wisc. Good win for Iowa.,Great Game Hawkeyes. Enjoyed watching every game this season. Can’t wait till next year! Good luck to all the seniors. 💛🖤,Great job Iowa! Way to finish strong to win 6 in a row!,"Great game guys!! Awesome season! This game is why I love the Hawkeyes!!! Interceptions::: back flips::: sacks and snow great playing from a great team!!

Hubby is Wisconsin fan so I have bragging rights,Always great to win the last game!!,Yes but Smith Marsette should be ashamed of himself. Act like a pro. Score and hand the ball to the official. Then go to the bench and act like you have been there before. Show some class.,Let's go on and win the championship !!!!,If I'm not mistaken. There is one more game of the season. Pretty sure next week's game isn't considered post season,Way to go Hawkeyes! 🖤💛,Thanks for a great season that almost wasn’t!

Why did Jones even try to field that punt? And what the hell was Smith-Marsette thinking? When you do something that unnecessary and stupid::: you can only blame yourself for the injury? Hawkeye or not::: stupid is stupid!,It would be killer if we had a crack at Iowa State in a bowl game version of the Cy-Hawk game.,Fun game to watch...good job::: Hawks!,Should be undefeated but still a great season! Go Hawks!,"Lost 2 games due to turnovers....be
at ourselves in the first two games",The nation is happy #heartland stays with Iowa,It's bullshit that they change the rule to 6 games because the cancel the Ohio state and Michigan game,Accept an early bowl game for next week before they all get canceled.,Great way to finish regular season.,"Iowa wave. 💛🖤 Iowa rules.

That’s what good sportsmanship is.,in case the salty Iowa State fans missed the score.,I didnt get to watch the game::: so::: I googled iowa vs isu::: thinking it would bring up tonight's game. This is what first came up and I thought wow that's a low scoring game. 😆😂😂,The Hawkeyes cannot b defeated by their instate rivals the Iowa State Cyclones,It has always been a Hawkeye state !,To bad they forfeited the football game this year. That should be a Cyclone win!,Big words for not playing them in football this year. I think this stat would be obsolete.,Such a ridiculous post. Where’s Univ of Iowa?

Hawkeye State.,Watched the second half after the rodeo,Sam Hawk,we might be lucky not to be playing the Cyclones in football this year::: though... just sayin',Interesting. Which football team is in their conference championship game? Oh::: right.,Who is our little brother!!!!,Cool. Meanwhile::: ISU is #7 in the nation::: conference regular season champions and playing for a big 12 title and New Years 6 bowl in football 🥱,Find it funny how much Hawk fans care were Iowa State is ranked.,We’ll just leave this here,Always a Hawkeye State!,To my friend Judy Mason Bjornsen::: Maybe this is the reason the Gazette gives more ink to Iowa than Iowa State. Ya think?😆,Proud to be a Hawkeye 🖤💛,Only cuz they couldn’t play fb this year😝,Say it,BTN did not show the game in central OH can i assume from this post that the Hawks won?,Heith Sheeley....,Sheldon Lovan,Ashley Hutchison...,Jake,Ryan Carter,Katie Schleusner that’s a lot of days,Jillian Lynott. 😮,You betcha!,Melissa Ferrin,"I have been passing through many scammers online::: i almost lose all my money but I promise to my self that I will never give up not until i get to the root of binary options trading.

Today::: Iowa Wrestling legend Dan Gable received the Presidential Medal of Freedom. The award is the nation’s highest civilian honor::: conferred upon those who have made especially meritorious contributions to the security or national interests of the United States::: world peace::: culture::: or other significant public or private endeavors. Go Hawks! https://bit.ly/2JTJmCR,2020-12-07 23:25:00,"Congratulations
Coach Gable! Well deserved! Thanks to President Trump for presenting this honor to a living legend!",I am glad Dan received this honor::: and then the WH staff just left him standing there in front of the reporters. Thank goodness Mr Gable had the grace and charisma to get out of the embarrassing moment. No grace or protocol in the WH staff including the President that just left him standing there.,So proud President Trump recognized this remarkable man for the Presidential Medal of Freedom award!,"Have followed his wrestling competition and his career over the years. None more deserving than he.
Congratulations",Not really sure how this is so important to freedom that Dan got the Presidential Medal of Freedom for it. Not Dan’s fault::: but definitely Donny’s fault for not knowing what all the words on the medal means.,How sad that the luster of the medal was diminished when it was given to Rush Limbaugh::: whose done ABSOLUTELY NOTHING for this country. Dan Gable was and is truly deserving!,Why? I’ll tell you. He was an ambassador for our country. He made tremendous difference in the lives of many people! He was someone to look up to. To model one self after. He certainly was driven and a motivator. Every Iowan could take pride in having him as a fellow Iowan!,"Congratulations
Mr Gable ::: I do recall as Director of Sales at Village East aka Arrowwood::: you::: your family and the wrestlers stayed at the resort for an escape yet the Hawk Club of the Lakes came through and entertained you with much respect so well deserved ::: God Bless",Dan is such a great guy! My buddy and I met him at the state fair. He talked with us for 15 minutes. Very nice,"Congratulations
Dan You certainly deserve this. I’ve always been so proud of you! I grew up with Kathy::: lived across the street. The medal ceremony was very nice. So nice to see all your family too
🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸",Congrats and well deserved but Disappointed he didn’t wear a mask. He’s a leader and people pay attention. No comments needed.,"CONGRATULATIONS
DAN GABLE YOU ARE WELL DESERVING OF THIS AWARD. YOU MADE IOWA PROUD & THE WRESTLING WORLD. :-)",And just who was it that awarded this well deserved award to mr Gable ? Asking for a friend !,An honor for Gable and the whole state of Iowa and USA wrestling!!!,I’d call that a shared Iowa/Iowa State honor.He wrestled at Iowa State and was in the Olympics while at Iowa state. It is certainly an honor for the State of Iowa.,"So proud of this man! I have long admired him and his talent- Both as a wrestler and coach.
Go Dan Gable!!","Congratulations
on this well deserved prodigious honor!","And the “President*” just walked out of the room and left him standing there. Shameful conduct from the “leader” of this country.

Congratulations
::: Mr. Gable::: on a well-deserved honor.",Dan Well done::: and well deserved. Politics has nothing do do with this great honor.,"Congratulations
on a well-deserved honor. But I was disappointed to see that neither Coach Gable nor his family attending the ceremony were wearing masks.","Congratulations
to you::: Dan for making the state of Iowa proud of you!! 🖤💛🖤💛🖤💛","Congratulations
Dan Gable. To bad the President couldn't at least smile and not look pissed most the time. It appeared that he really had no interest. Don't put me down itill you go back and watch it.","Congratulations
to Dan Gable on such an amazing award!!!! Too bad people can't leave their crap out of it and be happy for an Icon from IOWA!!!!",How 'bout them Hawks?,Dan is an alumni of my high school-West Waterloo! So proud🙂,"Who cares who it came from. Should be focused on the merit of the mans accomplishments
. Where has the positivity gone.",I am sorry the award came from the current president. I do believe that Gable was probably the nation’s best wrestler of all time. Not sure how wrestling brings the Presidential Medal of Honor into play::: but .....,"Someone who truly deserves it. Congratulations
!!","I've cheered this legend on since high school. I can't think of anyone more deserving of this award. Congratulations
::: Dan Gable",Wrestling was the highlight of my 4 years at Iowa! Graduated 1977.,This is disgusting. And not a mask in sight at that ceremony. Everyone in close quarters. Why on earth did he receive this? He's pompous.,"It’s exciting to see Dan Gable recognized for his great achievements...
a very inspiring Iowan that makes all Iowans proud!",Unfortunately the award has been diminished by the presentation to Limbaugh.,Congrats Coach Gable🖤💛 A true Legend for the sport!,Congrats coach! It was such a pleasure to be a cheerleader for 4 of your years there. You were the only coach that was secure enough in your talent as a coach and your athletes that you shared your facilities with the Cheer squads to allow us to practice and warm up in your mat room. You were a true “team player!”,This is an American and Iowa Hero,Thank you for being an American that never stopped trying to be the greatest in the world. As a person from Waterloo / Cedar Falls prayed for you when we needed inspiration.,He is an icon!,"Congratulations
Coach! Truly an amazing man!",Congrats Coach Gable! You earned it.,There’s tough and then “ There’s Gable Tough”.,I was named after his sister..my Dad and Mom were his God parents in Waterloo!,I remember Dan and his teammates eating a late night steak dinner at the Cave Inn. (Chris Taylor had two!),A proud moment for Iowa.,Should have had a mask on.,He was celebrated surrounded by a bunch of mask-less people. Smart. 🙄,I have met Dan Gable & heard him speak & I think he could inspire this 78-year old grandma to wrestle for him.😁,"Congratulations
and well deserved !! My sister remembers you running the stairs wearing ankle weights at Waterloo West.",Can't believe he wasn't wearing a mask.,Congrats to a great human being.,"A definite legend! Congratulations
::: Coach! Well deserved","Congratulations
on an award well deserved.","Congratulations
to Dan Gable! Iowa proud! It was a beautiful ceremony!","Focusing on the award::: not politics. Congratulations
::: well deserved Coach Gable",Great man and leader. A true inspiration. I was honored to meet him.,Done for Iowa votes I suppose. Great wrestler and world peace???,What an honor to a great athlete and coach!,He was epic. I watched the ceremony . It was great!,"So deserved! Congratulations
::: Coach Dan Gable!! You’re a true legend!",This is my mom holding Dan's gold medal after he won it,"Congratulations
Dan Gable!",So love this.....what a great athlete::: coach and person,Incredible story::: athlete and coach.,"Actual transcript—

Trump: Do you think I could take you in wrestling? Would I have a big advantage?

MR. GABLE: No::: you would have no chance. (Laughter.)

Trump (embarrassed::: storms off without saying goodbye)",Dan was an awesome wrestler!,"Totally deserved. An Iowa icon. But he may have taken too many blows to the head if he’s a big Trump supporter—which
he must be because Trump only rewards his supporters. Of course no mask because the cult has politicized public health.",Congrats!!!! Why the political smack?!! Not needed,Unfortunately glory bag Trump made it an issue about himself,Where did u get that?,"Congratulations
Gable::: its a well deserve honor. Shine on",Just goes to show you that President Trump couldn't do anything right if he tried so sorry for your demos,Let's wait and see the outcome.,"You’d be unhappy if he gave you a million dollars$$$
(I don’t know what has to do with you receiving money::: but. . . . .)",I have never met anyone more intense !,Send me that picture. It's not very big,Get me a picture like that.,"Wow::: we have people who gave the ""pissy face"" for Gable receiving this high honor?
At one time Gable was the Best wrestler in the World::: not once was he scored on in the '72 Olympics::: that's just simply Amazing and something he should be given credit for....
Congrats Gable! 👊",Great:::but no masks? What were you thinking Dan????,"Congratulations

Saturdays are for the Hawkeyes.,2020-11-21 18:00:00,"......and for the KIDS.
Grandson #1 waving to Grandson #4...",Who does Iowa play today? When and where? TV?,🖤💛🖤💛,Love the Hawkeyes and supporting at Great Bar n Grill! 💛🖤🏈,Go Hawkeyes Go always be the winner,Go Hawkeyes!! Proud of all these guys and the organization’s support for the players taking a stand for their beliefs and against oppression by taking a knee. For those of you too close-minded to appreciate that the freedoms we enjoy in this country allow this::: well - good riddance! The Hawkeyes don’t need fans like that.,Do it another time and place!!!!!,And it was an awesome Saturday!!,Was so sad to see they weren't standing for the flag! We are all Americans and t h is is our flag!!!!!!!!,Go HAWKEYES. 🏈great love of country,For those of you who think there is nothing wrong with taking a knee during the National Anthem...Well::: you all need to step back and look into a mirror and ask yourself what you have done for your country. I'd be willing to bet the answer for the vast majority of you is not much. For those of us who served in the Military::: especially during war time know what we did. We all took a oath to defend the United States and the flag that stands for it. Many died for that flag::: including a classmate that went in with me during Vietnam. Taking a knee during the Nation Anthem is in bad taste. So don't thank a veteran for their service and then take a knee. It's a slap in the face for those of us who actually did something for this country...and your freedom is and always be dependent on for those willing to serve!,Yeah::: kneeling is so bad. GO HAWKS!,Fantastic run by 54!,Never knew back when Iowa was #1 and Michigan was #2 the officials had to stop play for Michigan because of excessive crowd noise at Kinnick Stadium 😀,They lost any respect I have for them.,Absolutely and Always!!!🖤💛🖤💛🖤💛,I was so glad to see another solid performance 😄,We got this Hawkeyes!,They’re playing Friday,Frank Brewer has been blocked by me. Don't have to worry about his comments anymore. (FYI you can block people yourself so you don't see their comments.),Nothing to do with the flag? They are kneeling during the national anthem right? When we traditionally stand and remove our hats and face the “flag”. Not saying they should not do it or don’t have the right to do it::: but it has everything to do with the flag.,Go Hawkeyes Go beat the Nittany Lions this afternoon!!!!,love my hawks!!,Hawkeyes for life! Love my hometown team!,"Sports are one of the most divisive ventures of humans. Every wonder why sports fans say they ""hate"" certain teams or players? They can't explain it to me.",If these are your feelings you’re entitled to your opinion but why do you follow this page if you can’t say something positive?,How about I S U !!!,Yes::: we have two exciting games to watch today!,WHY FOOTBALL MAN NO STAND UP?! 😡,Very cool photo,Did they win?,Actually yesterday was for the Cyclones,That's true! Go Hawks! 🏈🏈🏈,see you next week !,"They're not social distancing...wt
f?",I don't I used to. Take a knee youre not for me!,Lisa Rappold,Let's go Hawks!! Keep in Rolling!💛🖤,Great game. Thanks for the Saturday afternoon thrills. ❤️🖤💛🏈,Don’t tell my father that.,"But is there swimming? Or gymnastics? Or tennis?

Come on::: Hawkeyes!",Damn I have to say this. Let’s all get real here. Many men and women fought for the right for us to protest when we see a wrong! That is called democracy. I also want to remind people.. many a Blackman have died defending that same democracy. But they still had to deal with “ being black”. It also goes for anyone who wasn’t born with lily white skin(honestly there is some white folks that need to get over themselves) And that what really kills me ::: you all are the same people who scream “ my rights. .. my rights” when a lot people are sick and dying right now and because you decided you have a right to not wear a mask( also a protest) So until we all come together and every human being in this country (and world) realize we are all human beings and should be treated equally. And until we get that mind set it will only get worse!,Because you are to stand for the National Anthem not kneel that's just the way it is if you wish to kneel do it before or after the playing of are Country's National Anthem thank you and god bless,Being a V.N.veteran::: I was taught you STAND for the Flag::: and kneel for the cross. If you're kneeling for the National Anthem::: or kneeling for the raising of the flag::: you're just grand standing wanting everybody to look at you::: aren't you cute.,Could not of said it better Jeff :::thank you for your service.,Once a Hawkeye::: always a Hawkeye 💛🖤 Go Hawks!,To those bemoaning the taking of a knee::: it has NOTHING to do with the military or the flag. Please do some research. When Kapernick first did it::: he had the acceptance of acquaintances in the military. Keep in mind that you are free to say and do and believe what you want. Why not athletes?,I bleed black and gold. I love these players! I love that they do recognize inequalities and that they take a stand against it! As a season ticket holder::: I will be excited when I can be back at Kinnick cheering them on! GO HAWKS!,They don't deserve to be supported because they disrespect America and our flag!!!!!! The oppressed pussies !!!!!!,Maybe those kneeling should have a father::: brother::: etc. Killed protecting our flag,Absolutely!,Great job Kyler Fisher!! Go HAWKS!!,That’s pretty arrogant!,Me either.,Yep.,Let’s go Hawks!,GO HAWKS!!🏈🏈👍,Go HAWKS 🏈,Go Hawks!,Go hawks,🖤💛🏈,Got that right Frank.,Let’s go Hawks 💕,Go Hawks 🖤💛🖤💛🖤💛,Go Hawks!,Alan Zaback END IT!!!!😡,Amen!,GO HAWKEYES,Go hawks 💛🖤🏈,GO Hawks 👏👏👏,Sue Dorociak-Brady,Go Hawks! 💛🖤,Hawkeyes rock,Go Hawkeyes🖤💛,GO HAWKEYES 💛🏈🖤,Hell yes...Go Hawkeyes,Go Hawks beat Penn State.,In my Hawks t-shirt & ready to make the popcorn!!

University of Iowa researchers are working with Iowa State University to develop a nano vaccine for COVID-19. It would protect against the virus and be administered via nasal spray rather than a needle. https://bit.ly/32dNQKX,2020-11-16 23:25:00,Please teach your staff and students not to mix Dilauded and Morphine. Dilauded is dangerous even in minimal amounts and leads to breathing difficulties and Morphine added on to make someone “comfortable” is called MURDER and frankly you don’t deserve the title you have in my eyes as a teaching hospital anymore because this is the kind of crap your staff pulls because they’re playing God. Assisted suicide isn’t even legal so let’s just call it what it is.. murder. Love my city. Hate what you’re doing to our elders. Go fly a f-ing kite.,Good to see both of the schools working together to fight a common enemy.,And this is why Iowans are the best ever!! 💗,GO IOWA 😊,Cool,Kathy Wittenberg,Kim Rosen,Hy I'm interested,Interesting::: but I’m curious if it will be effective. The flu mist::: they discovered years after using it was not effective,Good for Iowa universities!,Wishing the UofIA the best. You have the staff to do this and make a difference. Throughout the years you have been spot on! Your medical staff have saved my life and its quality.,Maria Dominguez,So beautiful charming,Emily LittleJohn needle or spray?,Both schools working together makes me feel good! I certainly hope they can get this done💕,Good luck hope everything works out.,Great! Keep up the good work! HAwkeye proud!💛🖤,Nasal spray that reaches the lungs has been done by researchers::: must check my posts. But Doctor Fauci seems to overlook that approach which would protect medical workers and the patient.Then laser T I 33 instantly eradicates the virus::: causing it to shatter::: not harming nearby healthy tissues. Again Doctor Fauci never mentions it::: Arizona researcher and son::: researcher::: John Hopkins.,Kudos,Sarah Henderson,Kayla Cornett,The Cy-Hawk vaccine!,Hopefully more effective than the flu mist.,YES!,That sounds safer!,Glad they can come together as Iowans and put the rivalry aside for a common good!,Go Hawkeyes and 'Clones!! 🖤💛❤,The ISU connection is delivering aerosol vaccines to animals.

Friday Night Lights::: but make it Hawkeye Football.,2020-11-13 20:30:00,When players agree to play for a team::: any team::: they agree to rules of the organization they signed up with and depending on the rules of that organization it may or may not be ok to take that knee. That organization has the right to act or not. What a player::: or an employee can not do- if it breaks the terms of their agreement is expect to have their job for long by excercise their individual right during the organization time. Now::: what they do on their own time as an individual is their own choice to be respected.,They can kneel anytime they want! Why does it have to be during the national anthem. Why not before the anthem::: after the anthem::: before going in for half-time::: after the game::: etc. etc. Why kneel when OUR national song is playing and our FLAG is waving? It's not the kneeling or protesting but when they choose to do the kneeling.,Well:::the Hawks are finally 4-0 ! In kneeling during the National Anthem I mean.,Go Hawks Like you did Friday night,One thing has nothing to do with the other,How many pussies kneeled this week? Scott Cretors? I have not watched one down of Hawkeye football this year::: I was a diehard fan for 40 yrs. Nile Kinnick would be sickened!!,Were going to fight fight fight for Iowa and they did just that in kicking Minnesota's Butts last night. Now let's get ready and kick Penn State's butts next weekend. It's definitely our turn this year!!!!,They did good last night 🙂.,my second or maybe third team Go Hawks how is Charlie.,As a veteran I took an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States of America. It doesn’t mention the flag or the anthem but it says in the First Amendment that we are all guaranteed the right of free speech and I support the right to peacefully protest.,To those complaining about players taking a knee::: you do know that it has nothing to do with the flag or the military? Please do some research on this before excoriating those who are exercising their patriotic and constitutional right to protest.,Did Iowa play today? Let me know when they don't kneel during the national anthem and I might care.,Wow ::: I am amazed by the range of responses. Shows that we need some quiet time and connection to stop and hear one another. But let’s try! We have more in common than not-,For me there is no explanation for kneeling!

They used a quiet respectful stance that did not disturb the anthem. Yet they still made a point::: a peaceful way to note that America is not living up to its promises.,It’s heartbreaking that over 4:::000 Iowans a day have died for four straight days but there is still contact sports in colleges and high schools. 😡,Too bad. I can't watch when a team does not respect our flag and country. Not the time and place for a personal protest::: that is not why people watch you play your little game. Lost another Hawkeye supporter.,Well guess I will watch something else. For Gods sake their home field is named for a Heisman Award winner who died in service to his country who statue is at the entrance.,People::: it’s NOT about disrespecting the flag! It’s about RESPECTING all lives::: and intentionally::: Black lives!,As long as this kneeling isnt a thing::: you better not do this tonight or I will destroy all my gear!,I’m glad we live in a country where we can protest without going to jail!,Here's an idea. If you no longer support the team::: get lost. All the snowflakes are headed over to their safe space at Parler. Join them.,Sad to admit I have lost respect for them after taking a knee during OUR national anthem. Some of the children in the hospital were confused also.,Why aren’t they making a statement when they are off the field instead of following everyone else? Become leaders instead and DO something off the field!,Go Hawks tonight against the Gophers!!!,Herky Night In Iowa.,They shouldn't do it During the National anthem,Striving to be one as team and one in the nation and to be on the right side of history.

Jay Holstein is one of the University of Iowa’s most sought-after professors. In his 50 years::: he has taught more than 60:::000 Hawkeyes. Learn about his Jay’s impact in and outside the classroom and share a memory below if you took one of his classes.,2020-10-27 22:25:01,"Quest for Human Destiny....ever
yone wanted in::: & for good reason. It changed people’s lives::: changed the way you think. He’s an amazing professor & amazing speaker. He is by far the best professor I ever had. 💙",Attending his lectures was akin to experiencing a biblical rock 'n roll stand-up Zen comedy routine...he's a fascinating individual with an acerbic wit::: a finely-tuned professor possessing 'layers of meaning'::: and perhaps the University of Iowa's greatest academic treasure!,Loved his class! Also remember he was always running around campus like he was 30 years younger. I was a biology major::: so this was a very different experience for me. I wish everyone could take his class.,The thing I remember most was his kindness. Beyond the education.,I ended up with a minor in Religious Studies by accident because of him. Wonderful teacher! I wish I could find my notes. Class of ‘00,First heard him speak at initiation to Phi Eta Sigma 1991 and was beyond impressed! Loved Old Testament Survey and Judeo Christian::: by far the most captivating professor at Iowa and Wash U for grad school. Just told my niece who is a freshman at Iowa this year about him!!!,I took Old Testament History in 1975. The upper right black and white photo is the Professor I remember. He was one of the most engaging and informative storytellers I have ever encountered in my life!,"Kyle & Jack - I took Judeo-Christian
Tradition my Freshman year at Iowa in 85-86. I truly believe that class changed the course of my life for the better. Thank you Professor Holstein.",I ended up with a Religious Studies Minor because I took almost all of the classes he offered during the late 90s early 2000s. He is so compelling! My husband and I still talk about his classes and are baffled when we talk to other Hawkeyes that never took one of his classes! (They totally missed out!),"My favorite moments from Professor Holstein were in summer class. Some one opened a Pepsi on a particularly hot day. He commented that whoever it was should really bring one for everyone::: or at least the professor. The next day there was a cold Pepsi on the podium::: which he opened and drank with a satisfying :::""ahhh!"" He had every class in the palm of his hand.",Best professor at Iowa - bar none! Loved every one of his classes and got A’s in all - my notes were feverishly scribbled because I didn’t want to miss a word. There won’t be another like him.,I was in his Quest class and I remember people standing in the back or sitting in the aisle who weren’t enrolled but wanted to hear his amazing lectures!!,When I took Quest for Human Destiny with Professor Holstein in the mid 90's it was in a very large lecture hall on the Pentacrest. I felt so lucky to be able to enroll in his course since EVERY seat was filled and there were students sitting and standing in the aisles who had to be asked to leave because of fire code restrictions on capacity. I've carried and shared many of the concepts that I learned in his course with me throughout my life. What a gift!,I was lucky enough to take his class back in 2006. He created some of the most thought provoking discussions amongst the class that I have ever been a part of. He probed people's beliefs and brought you to a place where you could empathize with other backgrounds. Truly a one of a kind professor!,I took his quest for human destiny. I remember thinking a few classes into the semester “This guy has some of the answers I need to know.” As the semester went on::: I found that I didn’t get any answers::: only more questions. Then it hit me. I was not learning WHAT to think but instead learning how to question how I thought.,I took Judeo Christian Tradition my freshman year - he is one of the best instructors I've ever had. Wish he could have been my TA::: too🤣 I would be interested in taking another class of his via distance ed::: if that could ever be an option.,Quest For Human Destiny was a great class for many reasons::: but it was also my first experience with a streaker 😆 I just wish I could remember what Professor Holstein had to say about it at the time.,I never took one of his classes but remember hearing how great they were when I was an undergrad in the early 2000s.,By far the most dynamic professor I ever had. Judeo Christian Tradition::: Quest for Human Destiny::: Old Testament Survey. Couldn’t get enough of his classes! Feel blessed to have learned from him!,"A fascinating albeit eccentric man. I was teaching a class next to his and his very loud voice made my room shake. I went next door and asked him if he could lower his volume a bit. He did. I think he is an extraterrestria

.” I don’t remember the lesson::: just the reference. Outstanding professor! So fun to hear he continues to lead and teach!",Took many of his classes::: and his daughter Sarah was in some of my science classes as well!,50 years as an educator is phenomenally impressive!!,I was a video tech for one of his classes::: when he taught on the old ICN distance education system. He wasn’t a fan of that teaching environment::: but he was incredibly kind to me. (He was already a campus legend by that point::: so I was a bit worried.),I had his class the Holocaust. He was by far the most interesting professor and by far the best class. His classes were always full. Brings back great memories.,I was in a Quest for Human Destiny lecture on the afternoon of 9/11/01. As the news of the morning was passing through campus::: I wasn’t sure we’d have class. We did and I’ll never forget it. He flawlessly lectured from a common theme of “I know nothing will be the same after this.” I’ve thought about it a lot over the years. As a college level instructor myself::: he is a true inspiration.,favorite class at Iowa was his Quest For Human Destiny. great orator::: really captivating speaker that provided a good foundation for learning and different perspectives,Loved all 3 classes I took from Professor Holstein::: especially Quest for Human Destiny in summer session.,I took several classes and loved every one. I appreciated Hemingway novels before I heard his lectures::: but they remain my favorite because of his passionate lectures - the only books I still have from college are the version of “The Old Man and the Sea” and “Snow of Kilimanjaro” we read in his class.,Professor Holstein’s Quest for Human Destiny class was my favorite class while I was at Iowa. He was entertaining and insightful::: and he changed the way that you viewed the world. I wish that he had a podcast or similar media outlet that would allow us to continue to hear his lessons beyond graduation.,My sister::: who is 13 years older than I and attended Morningside College::: have an ongoing debate about who had the better professor for the Old Testament. I know I won that one hands down. His lectures were so energizing and informative. So captivating::: it was like going to story hour. 1979 BS::: 1983 MD.,I took his class The Bible and the Holocaust::: it was truly an honor to have him as a teacher!,I took one of Professor Holstein’s classes every semester I was at Iowa. By far the best::: most memorable and educational classes I took. ❤️,Having taken his Quest for Human Destiny class::: I respect the man a great deal more now. He is truly remarkable in so many ways.,"Professor Holstein's lectures were fascinating and thoroughly engrossing. I took his class on Judeo-Christian
Tradition and Quest for Human Destiny in the mid-80s. There was ALWAYS a waiting list to get into his classes.

I hope his lectures were recorded and it would be awesome if U of I would stream them online. I would listen to them all again.","I was just telling some coworkers about Professor Holstein and his Quest For Human Destiny class. Loved the class. Tried to take Judeo-Christian
Tradition but it was always full. BA1989",I work in Health care but Quest for Human Destiny is the class I think about most often. Loved Professor Holstein and try to be just as passionate with my students.,Old Testament Survey::: hardest class to get into! Also took Quest for Human Destiny. Jay Holstein instilled the desire to be a life long learner!!,My favorite professor of all time. I still think about the lectures and the books. I was glued to my seat::: hanging on every word.,Hands down my favorite professor and I still bring up things I learned in Quest for Human Destiny 33 years ago.,Quest was one of my favorite courses and due to how they did rotation back in the early 80’s with your ssn::: I had to wait 3 semesters to take it. People would sit in the stairways that is how much we wanted to be there,"I was a non-traditional
student in 1989 and took a religion course. I was in the front row of the auditorium as I always sat in the front of every class. ( Yeah::: I know::: typical non-trad.)A skinny guy walks onto the stage with white tennis shoes and gave a fabulous lecture. He was funny and energetic and I was so thankful for an instructor who loved his job. I have said through all of my undergrad and gradute school::: I have never learned so much as I did that semester from Dr. Holstein. I may even have the book yet!",When I listened to his lectures as a freshman from the small town of Algona I realized I was in a different world now. He was simply incredible and I never forgot him,1985 “Religion and Society”. I loved every minute of that class. I wish I could hear his lectures again.,There is nothing I could say about Holstein that hasn’t already been said a hundred times over::: but his classes truly reshaped my entire way of thinking. I also still laugh when I think of the time he told me he’d kick me out if I ever wore a Boston Celtics shirt to his class again. “Bill Russell RUINED my childhood! RUINED IT!”😂,I took his Old Testament class my last semester at Iowa. I truly enjoyed his course. My mom and stepdad have also taken classes taught by Dr. Holstein.,"Quest for Human Destiny and Old Testament Survey...standi
ng room only! Two of the best classes of my college career!","Great professor and a great human being. I had to leave school in March of my sophomore year when my mom was dying of cancer. He was so supportive and allowed me to finish the class via “correspondence
” since it was 1979 and online didn’t exist. His support meant a lot. Great person!",He is outstanding. Took every course he offered::: never missed a class. My fondest memories of my education at Iowa.,Listen::: everyone who went to Iowa May remember this or that::: but this guy stood out. His classes were terrific::: always loved hearing what was next,How is it possible in an auditorium of ~300 .. it felt like he was talking directly to me!? I took bible and the holocaust and Quest for Human Destiny ... it’s made me a better and more thoughtful person. Thank you Jay Holstein.,"He told me I'd live in a box one day.

Still enjoyed him as a professor.",9/11 in his classroom - so memorable!!,Loved his Old Testament class! I took it in 1974-75.,Honored to be one of the 60k. His class on the Holocaust was heart wrenching and eye-opening.,I remember he was an interesting speaker but sitting in a lecture hall with 400 other students and then having discussions with TAs leading meant that I literally don’t even remember what class I took from him 🤷🏻‍♀️,Always good-he spoke at our commencement also '91 classic!,"I am one of those 60:::000 students he taught. Loved his Judeo-Christian
Tradition class back in 1985.",Every time I tried to register it was already full. So::: I snuck in 3 lectures (“Quest for Human destiny “ class) to just listen to him. They were transformative.,I had him for two classes. Dynamic lecturer who made his classes very interesting. He remains one of only two professors from my undergrad years that I remember by name.,I took took quest for human destiny in 2006::: still one of the best classes!,I can still remember sitting in Professor Holstein’s lectures as he made Ancient Greece and Rome feel so real. A truly gifted teacher and scholar.,50 years as an educator of Hawkeyes !,"In 1977 I had Jay Holstein for 1/
3 of the Judeo-Christian Tradition class. I found his teachings on Judaism fascinating. Fast forward to 2014. I had just got the results of a DNA test telling me I am 1/3 Ashkenazi. All of Jay's teachings about ""Ye-ho-wa-ha"" came flooding back! Now it was personal. Thank you::: Jay!",I had old testament survey. Class was packed all the time.,Best professor on campus. Amazing class,Always looked forward to his Religion & Human Culture lectures.,One of the most memorable professors I had at the University of Iowa!,Took Quest for Human Destiny::: early 90s in a packed lecture hall. Still remember that class to this day,He was one of my favorites. I still have my mini cassettes that I recorded when I was in class.,I really regret not taking his class in the late 90s. Maybe I tried but it was full.,His reputation is unquestionable,He's an amazing speaker.,Quest was one of my favorite classes. LOVE professor Holstein!!!!!,"Judeo-Christian
was one of my favorite Gen-Ed classes. Loved it!",Thanks. I remember him::: but never had any of his classes.,He was the most awesome professor definitely my all time FAVORITE! 💛🖤💛,"Judeo-Christian
Traditions! I failed the Christian part (I was raised Christian) and ACED the Judeo part he taught. Ben Page Andrea McGinn Tina Lovan LOL::: remember?!","I LOVED Professor Holstein!!! Quest for Human Destiny...great
memories",Great professor. I so enjoyed his lectures.,Quest for Human Destiny was my favorite class!,Loved his lectures! I still remember them!,Favorite class I ever took was his!! Never a dull moment!!,One of the best! He just knows how to do it!,"Congratulations
on 50 years. Blessings to you and yours!",Quest for Human Destiny... 1986...life changing! Thank you::: Professor Holstein!,Took every class he taught -,"Judeo-Christian
Tradition::: Fall 1983::: and Quest for Human Destiny::: Spring 1984. 😊❤️",Quest for Human Destiny::: 1986. Amazing!,"Most dynamic professor I had at Iowa::: no one wanted the Judeo portion of Judeo-Christian
Tradition to end. A memory that sticks out and embodies his conversational lecturing style:

Prof: [lecturing::: *stops abruptly::: mid sentence*] Was there a fire downtown today?
Class: [collectively nods]
Prof: [continues lecturing::: *stops abruptly again*] Is the Pita Pit ok?
Class: [nods]
Prof: Good::: you ever had the cheesesteak there? First time I had it I thought I was back in Philly! [continues lecture]

Somehow it always felt like he was talking and bantering right to you even when lecturing to a packed auditorium in McBride Hall.","I tried every semester but could never get into Quest from 1984-1988...sti
ll not over it. Did get into Judeo/
Christian; never missed it and absolutely loved it and him::: but he gave me 1 of only 2 C’s I’ve ever gotten in my life...still not over it😂. Yet still my favorite class ever!",I was never able to get either of those classes::: but wish I had,One of my favorite professors!!,Old Testament 1976,“It don’t matter” I can still hear his lectures!!!! 💕,Quest for Human Destiny. He was great.,Fave class in my 4+ years!,I took 2::: so good I never skipped 😜,Wouldn’t it be pretty to think so.,"Judeo-Christian
Tradition",All these comments make me want to meet him.,Konnor Scanlon did you have him ?,Professor Holstein instructed one of the most informational and interesting courses I’ve ever taken and I learned so much from this great instructor. “The Bible & The Holocaust” was the course I took. Right when Covid hit::: he was extremely understanding and helped me make it through my final semester at Iowa successfully. I took his course as an elective and I hung on his every word during lectures! I thought I knew a bit of what I would learn based on assumptions and the little bit of history I’ve hung onto since high school::: and I was pleasantly surprised to find out how wrong I was! One of my favorites by far and just the amount of information he provided that I have retained is unreal. I have had lengthy discussions with my boyfriend where I have shared with him the things I’ve learned from Professor Holstein and his course::: and I know both of us have passed this knowledge along to others. He gave me a profound respect and understanding of these events in history that I never had before::: and I know I won’t forget!,The Holocaust seminar was the most important class I took in all my years at Iowa. Reading so many books from survivors and hearing Jay Holstein’s lectures impacted my entire life. An amazing professor::: guiding us all to dig for the truth.,"If I remember correctly::: I had three of Professor Holstein's classes ('Old Testament Survey:::' 'Judeo-Christia
n Tradition:::' and 'Quest for Human Destiny') when I was an undergrad at Iowa. Fantastic professor::: and a genuinely interesting person! He would often start class by saying something really ""random"" and humorous. Two things I remember: 1) One time when he had a cold::: he was complaining about the amount of phlegm in his throat and snot in his nose. He asked the class::: ""So::: dear students::: what do you do with your phlegm and snot?"" and 2) Another day he was talking about how he enjoyed running::: especially early in the a.m. through downtown Iowa City. He said::: ""So::: this morning I went for my usual jaunt through downtown. At one point I stopped to look at my reflection in one of the store windows and I thought::: 'Damn::: I am one handsome devil! I know that an ordained rabbi shouldn't say things like that::: but really::: I am incredibly handsome and in fantastic shape!'"" :-) In all of my years as a student and a teacher::: I don't think I've ever seen anyone::: anywhere::: keep the rapt and undivided attention of 500-750 undergrads::: especially early in the morning. Holstein was/is one of those true ""rock star"" professors::: and wait lists to get into his classes were longer than lines for Rolling Stones concert tickets. Jill Slipper Scholtz::: Kent Bress::: Christopher von Gries::: Geoff Newton::: Colleen Frost Fullenkamp::: Joe Fullenkamp::: Mark Fullenkamp::: Jill Garmoe::: Andy Hall. (Andy Hall::: I know that you went to Iowa only for law school::: but I thought you would find this interesting.)",I loved Quest for Human Destiny! Possibly the best class I’ve ever taken. I still remember and think about it 25 years later. And Holstein::: I did end up taking Death of Ivan Illych to read on the beach.,"Like so many others have stated::: Quest For Human Destiny was thought-provoki
ng and completely engaging. I loved every minute of that class. I believe I still have my notes packed away::: after 36 years! Congratulations
to Dr. Holstein for such an outstanding career.",We have friends and acquaintances where I have lived the past 33 years (Green Bay) who are Jewish. They were impressed that I could carry on an interesting conversation regarding their faith. I give all the credit to Rabbi Holstein. However::: I think the most impacting lecture he gave in my view was when he discussed the St. Louis being turned around and sent back to Europe during Hitler’s reign of terror. This was a part of US history that was missed in my high school course::: and I appreciate that he gave us a more complete account of history.,I took every class he taught! He was just amazing!,I ❤️ Prof Holstein’s lectures. Have many memories if the books I read in his class,Zoë Theobald,Anne Murray Stitt Tommy Murray Angela Tsihlopoulos,Alex Bruzzini,Awesome,"Wow!

Trump discouraged wearing mask.Has ruined the country.
(2) The influence of the United States in world politics during Trump's time is extremely declining.Now different countries ignore USA about international affairs.
(3) Trump said the United States would be great again but the opposite picture in world politics.
(4) In the time of Trump Russia::: China::: Iran have become stronger in the international arena.Trump is very weak in diplomatic skills.
(5) USA has become loneliness in the time of Trump in the world. If Trump is in power::: it will be further damaged::: which will not be able to overcome throughout the ages.
(6) In the time of Trump::: his family is rulling the country::: not by the government.
(7) He does not care about the Senate or the House of Representatives
.He is bypassing them and doing everything by executive order.He has appointed judges in the Supreme Court to give legality of his every works. So the Congress is unnecessary for him.
(8) Where his responsibility as the President of the country is to bring everyone together but doing the opposite.He is an extreme racist.He is dividing the people and the country.The consequences will be terrible.
(9) He has already recorded a lie that is driving the country towards immorality. It will affect the mentality of the people of the country::: the society.But in the past::: nice mentality made the United States great.
(10) He does not believe in science.He does not believe::: does not understand climate change.So he has canceled various climate agreements.He is endangering the lives of the people of the world.Will it make the United States great?Never

can never be cut.
(14) If Trump is in power::: the white-black conflict will continue to grow.Because he is provoking even after becoming the president.The glorious history of America will be destroyed.
(15) There is no respect for law by trump . He asked voters to vote twice.May be he has mental problem.
(16) During his time::: bad relations have been established with most of the countries of the world with USA.For this:::it will affect on economy and politics in USA soon.But it is not realised now.

Iowa City ranks as the #1 college town in America using data from the United States Census Bureau. It’s great to be a Hawkeye. http://spr.ly/6014G2jvo,2020-10-18 17:00:02,Please teach your staff and students not to mix Dilauded and Morphine. Dilauded is dangerous even in minimal amounts and leads to breathing difficulties and Morphine added on to make someone “comfortable” is called MURDER and frankly you don’t deserve the title you have in my eyes as a teaching hospital anymore because this is the kind of crap your staff pulls because they’re playing God. Assisted suicide isn’t even legal so let’s just call it what it is.. murder. Love my city. Hate what you’re doing to our elders. Go fly a f-ing kite.,👍👍👍,Always a Hawkeye. '62.,Of course we’re #1.

A Hawkeye is representing the state of Iowa at next month’s Miss USA competition. Morgan Kofoid has spent 2020 fulfilling the duties of Miss Iowa USA::: while also working at University of Iowa Stead Family Children's Hospital::: following her graduation from the University of Iowa College of Nursing in December. https://bit.ly/30MVn2o,2020-10-16 19:30:02,"Trump's failure ::: 1) In terms of population::: the United States is 3rd and the population is one third compared to China and India::: but the death toll in Covid-19 is the highest. Trump discouraged wearing mask.Has ruined the country.
(2) The influence of the United States in world politics during Trump's time is extremely declining.Now different countries ignore USA about international affairs.
(3) Trump said the United States would be great again but the opposite picture in world politics.
(4) In the time of Trump Russia::: China::: Iran have become stronger in the international arena.Trump is very weak in diplomatic skills.
(5) USA has become loneliness in the time of Trump in the world. If Trump is in power::: it will be further damaged::: which will not be able to overcome throughout the ages.
(6) In the time of Trump::: his family is rulling the country::: not by the government.
(7) He does not care about the Senate or the House of Representatives
.He is bypassing them and doing everything by executive order.He has appointed judges in the Supreme Court to give legality of his every works. So the Congress is unnecessary for him.
(8) Where his responsibility as the President of the country is to bring everyone together but doing the opposite.He is an extreme racist.He is dividing the people and the country.The consequences will be terrible.
(9) He has already recorded a lie that is driving the country towards immorality. It will affect the mentality of the people of the country::: the society.But in the past::: nice mentality made the United States great.
(10) He does not believe in science.He does not believe::: does not understand climate change.So he has canceled various climate agreements.He is endangering the lives of the people of the world.Will it make the United States great?Never
(11) Trump's relatives who have known him since childhood:::told that Trump's past history is very bad.
(12) On the immigration issue::: Trump has treated children cruelly by separating them from their parents.
(13) If Trump's power continues::: the violence in the United States will reach a deadly level.The world's number one country will begin to be destroyed.Which
can never be cut.
(14) If Trump is in power::: the white-black conflict will continue to grow.Because he is provoking even after becoming the president.The glorious history of America will be destroyed.
(15) There is no respect for law by trump . He asked voters to vote twice.May be he has mental problem.
(16) During his time::: bad relations have been established with most of the countries of the world with USA.For this:::it will affect on economy and politics in USA soon.But it is not realised now.
(17) Such an extremely immoral person cannot be the President of the United States::: because he will ruin the glory of America::: which has already begun.

President Bruce Harreld to retire having helped revamp the University of Iowa’s financial and academic infrastructure.

The sooner that Bruce can be out of Iowa City the better.
*If he could take VP Lehnertz and AD Barta with him that would be ideal.",I hope they find a highly qualified academic who could help restore the university’s academic standing and stem the flow of department heads and others who have left.,Would it be too much for the citizens of Iowa to demand the board of regents find qualified candidates who are both post-secondary educators and have some business experience?,Bring back the number one party school.,Bruce Harreld has done a very good job. As a recently retired professional employee of the University::: I can honestly say that in the beginning I had my doubts. However::: over time I grew to like and respect him a lot. He has done a great job. He made some needed changes that may not have been popular with everyone::: but were needed nonetheless.,I didn't think I would like him but he did a good job and he learned a lot and we learned a lot and his office put out some nice notes during the pandemic that really kept spirits up for staff and faculty. He also fought for us with the governor and did a good job of keeping as much money as we did,Thank you Iowa!!!!,Thank you for voting to hold football this season. One of the few with any common sense (and not politically motivated).,Blah...,Meanness exists because some have absolutely nothing good to say about anyone - no matter what! Why not just say good luck???? 🤔,The thing is : the board of regents determines how much money each university will receive for a budget. The president has to determine priorities to stay within that budget. Unfortunately::: because the colleges’ expenses have increased so dramatically::: it is almost impossible to manage. Only time will tell how well he truly did during his tenure.,"Congratulations

He was caught and questioned about it. And he tossed aside nonchalantly::: when asked what he was proposing to do about the sexual assaults: RAPE::: on campus.
Shame on him!
Iowa::: at one point::: topped the list as one of leading Colleges for assaults!....an
d one of my daughter's attended there at this time::: when that statistic was made public in the news.
I'm sure it was even before that::: when my other daughter went.
He couldn't remember the 6 point plan::: that former president Mason had put forth::: to stop these assaults!
Guess who remembers those 6 points? The women who got assaulted::: and also other faculty. He even said: ""Shame on me""::: when he couldn't remember the 6 points. 🤬
Assaults and rapes on the Iowa Campus were at a high at this time! The only one who thought it was funny::: was the *then famous comedian* who did one of the assaults after doing his stand up comedy there!
I bet he doesn't stand so well now!",This is good news for all.,Change is needed. This will be good news for the university. Let’s bring in some respectful candidates to make Iowa inclusive for all.,3%!!! THAT is how low the percentage was of who thought he should be president!

* When the upper water is clear::: the lower water is clear *

The 21st century marks a new history of this global village. Now people around the world are not in every way pre-twentieth-c
entury thinking. The 21st century must not deviate from the point that it is the first century of world peace occupied by heaven. For this purpose::: it has long been a long time since the world has created and operated a large framework called the United Nations (UN) to ensure an eternal and peaceful life for mankind. Accordingly::: the natural affairs of the United Nations itself::: which should always be operated in a just and smooth manner::: are neglected::: or all countries::: including permanent member states and general member states::: are too far away from their own set of duties related to the United Nations (UN). In the case of disagreement::: the United Nations (UN) is a permanent member state or all member states and non-members so that all members can cooperate with a strong determination to atone for the atonement of all members of the United Nations to quickly improve or cope with the fundamental basis of the Great Compromise. It seems that there should be a reconsideration
in all aspects::: such as the reform of the country and the restriction of veto rights for all of the nations. All countries in the world have the same right to live freely and peacefully. The world must never deviate from the basic big frame of brothers and sisters in the world::: where each other in all countries is not another::: but is the family of one grandfather and one ancestor. The world must be reborn as a peaceful::: true world of true humans on a broader level.

The 21st century is the first century of world history and world peace. All humanity in the global village must live according to the Creator's providence given by the universe law.

For this

The first step is to hold a world-wide World Peace Advancement Competition with the same concept as the Olympic Games::: where all the world's leaders participate together under the leadership of the United Nations.

The second step is to establish the headquarters of the World Humanities Education Center to restore the humanity of people all over the world in order to restore the nature of the birth of mankind in the creation of the universe. .

In the third stage::: the world must establish a new mutual peace partnership with each other according to the rules established by each country and the United Nations.

In the fourth stage::: the United Nations (UN) must establish a new mutual peace partnership with each other between the continents of the world (adjustable from 6 to 8 continents) according to the rules established by the United Nations.

In the fifth stage::: with the structural reform of the United Nations (UN)::: the world government representing the global humanity of the world-centered United Nations (UN) of a new birth was born into a world government representative of the United Nations (UN). Is to implement the Peace Confederation of World Continents.

Finallyᆢ

In the sixth stage::: the global village that represents the newly established United Nations-centere
d World Federation for Peace by the World Continent and the new global government's operation plan in the short and long term will be announced. We need to create an opportunity for the launch of the unified government and the opening of the World Peace Festival where people from all over the world live together.

Every year::: about 60:::000 Americans are diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease. University of Iowa engineers and neurologists have developed a highly efficient algorithm that can detect the disease.

Otherwise::: I don't really see the positive side of knowing that you will get this disease (before you have symptoms) without there being a treatment or cure available.

incoming Freshman! Make the most of your college years::: not just in the classroom but in the real world too.

Set your feet firmly on the path to a wonderful rest of your life.",I am from Brazil and this University changed my life and gave me lots of professional opportunities in my home country,"Dear Iowa:::

Remind Hawkeyes fans academics come first before football. Health comes first before parties. I love these positive posts::: but as a upset alumni::: I am upset you are not doing enough. I am upset you have not taken your time to help the student athletes with their scholarships and tell the parents sports are canceled for a reason. I studied with the Iowa writers workshop and took many English and literature classes::: this is what I get when I left 4 years ago? The children’s hospital finally put the school’s nursing programs at national recognition and you can’t remind people this comes first before football? If this post gets deleted::: then I know your true colors are not black and gold.

Good day",As a native born Iowan and Iowa grad::: I am ashamed of how poorly my home state and the UI have responded to Covid. The UI should have been closed until vaccine::: masks should be mandatory statewide::: and oh - only one football coach - an easily replaced overpaid trainer - was fired when the racism that’s evident to anyone with a brain 🧠 was uncovered this summer. The entire football staff should’ve been given their walking papers and no golden parachutes. I live in California now - and despite all its issues it’s a zillion times better to live in than a Iowa is now... while I got an excellent education at Iowa in the 80s I wouldn’t steer any gifted student there today.

to you all! Go HAWKEYES!",Congrats,Missing Iowa,"University of Iowa what about the freshman athletes of the 4 Olympic sport teams you just shafted using shady financials? How accomplished should they feel? How abandoned should they feel?

Where’s the integrity?",Its a great University.,May they return the school to a deserved number one party institution. Ask an alum about toga parties for a good start.,Good students come to Iowa .

New research from Iowa shows parents can help their children learn more quickly how to cross roads safely. It’s best to help the child look at the oncoming traffic and pick out ahead of time which gap you’re going to choose. https://bit.ly/3ji7POF,2020-09-08 17:25:00,"Everyone mocking the study didn’t read the article. Here’s a quote to help you understand.

“If this was something that parents were doing most of the time::: then that would be great:::” Plumert says. “But our study shows that parents aren’t using effective strategies to help their child learn about safe road crossings all that often. But the times the parents do have useful instructions::: it’s really helpful to the child. They just show much better performance crossing roads.”","Some parents never teach their kids the same.
My parents said look left first::: then look right::: and look left once more. Works well. I do this while driving too.",No way,Lol. Look both ways before you cross the street.

-Studying a lot and succeeding are not all achieved by yourself-

1. No matter how foolishly lacking parents::: they are certainly parents.

2. Parents living with disabilities are certainly parents.

3. Parents who haven't learned anything are definitely parents.

4. Parents who couldn't save money in their lifetime are certainly parents.

5. Usually very strict parents are rather very blessed parents.

6. Always discuss important things in life with your parents.

7. Synthesize almost everything in your daily life and inform your parents.

8. Understand and do what your parents usually say.

9. No matter how busy you are in your life::: call your parents frequently.

10. Go anywhere near you with your frustrated parents.

11. Pay your parents' pocket money like tithing. Everyone comes back.

12. Don't just neglect your poor-looking parents::: take care of them.

13. Do not disobey every single word of your parents::: but follow them well.

14. If you can't see your parents' eyes::: wear glasses and give them a hearing aid if your ears are dark.

15. My parents' health is my health. Check and take care of them from time to time.

16. Ask your parents about any difficulties while living.

17. Discuss well with each other so that there is no quarrel between siblings over parents.

18. The world with my parents seems to have passed::: but if I can't move::: there is no way.

19. If it is practically impossible to have parents::: seek help from the state.

20. If elderly parents are neglected::: they will be held liable for violation of their duty to support.

21. If you or your children marry and have children::: they are all parents.

22. When you become a parent::: then you can think of your parents properly.

23. If you take good care of your parents::: you will be helped by your children later.

24. When I was a child::: my parents' vice-versa were all things that my children told me to do well.

25. Make sure to see your parents as often as you had before.

The Hawkeye wave was born three years ago. We can't wait for the incredible moment the best tradition in sports is able to return. 👋👋,2020-09-05 12:00:00,University of Illinois has a quick saliva test for covid developed by their Vet school. Maybe you should compete in something that MATTERS and get a quick saliva COVID19 test for Iowa—since it is surging on campuses and they apparently need to get drunk at football games.,Yes glad it was done on Saturday with a few,Miss it so much this year. Everyone please stay safe and healthy!!!!!,This CA Hawkeye alum had the wonderful opportunity to share in the wave two years ago. Seeing that a few people got together and waved last Saturday got me to thinking. Would it be possible for people to photo or video their own waves from home::: send it in to someone somewhere with the skills and ability to loop them together and create a video or massive photo board that could be sent to Stead for the kids and updated from time to time. Even better::: have people hold or wear signs of where they are from. The kids could keep track of the places with pins on a map...good activity for them both placing the pins and viewing the map. Come on::: Hawkeye fans::: we can do this...for the kids!,Thanks ...3E power man???,Also a Jumping At The Bean Wave shot too! Yahoo!,I always get terry eyed just watching them do the wave. Wish I could be there to do. Go Hawks?,As I said in another post::: the high school teams should take a video at their games waving to the kids.,It is the best tradition. Hawkeyes nation 😇God bless all those patients,The visiting teams even look forward to it.,We ❤️ the Wave! Our family always hopes we are in the stadium waving up.,The cheer squad and Herky did the wave today.,Way to go Sharon::: quotation marks go Hawks,Praying we can return to this sooner than later!,This is awesome! Oh my how the kids will miss The Wave this fall!! So sad no football at Kennick!!,"Not being able to do the wave.......That
is as huge as Hawks not playing. :-(",I think they should do the wave::: have maybe each dorm or housing on campus take a Saturday go out of the field and in the stands ans wave like they would at a game,A great tradition.,I can wait until it's safe to do so. <3,Have been there for all the waves:::it’s great.,We were there for the first wave::: not many dry eyes. Awesome tradition👋👋👋,Best part of game day for me!!! LOVE IT!,My husband and I got to be apart of this a couple years ago and man was it an incredible feeling! I didn't even take a picture or a video because it was so breathtaking. We won that game::: which made it even more powerful and I think our whole section had a tear or two during this. Amazing tradition!🖤💛,Love the Hawkeyes thinking of moving up there next summer honestly,It is truly the Greatest Tradition in College Football!,It is such a great felling to see all of the children smiling and waving back to the fans going to miss that this year with no big ten football 🏈,Driving by on I 80 last month we waved going both directions. Not the same I’m sure::: but the kids were in our thoughts.,Incredible feeling to watch on TV but very emotional to see in person. Can't wait for it to come back. Go Hawks!!,Wave goodbye to the Iowa Wave::: thanks B1G,"Love this tradition!! 👋👋
It’s the best!! I have a Senior at Univ of Iowa 💛🖤. Can’t wait to get back to waving to all the kids again!",We miss this!

Missing the wave",There is nothing better than this !!❤️❤️❤️,Took this the first year!,It's an incredible feeling to be in the hospital with your child and witnessing the wave. My son::: 2 at the time had a few day stay at Steads last year. We witnessed the first game of the season::: and our first wave! Very emotional moment! 🖤💛,Instead of waving we need to be “masking up”...,They should be playing today.,Such a moving experience to witness and be a part of while my son was a student at IOWA.,If you don’t adhere to social distance and masks this tradition will be gone forever,Herky came and waved at us today!,Absolutely LOVE THIS and The HAWKEYES. 💛🖤💛🖤,And we were there !!! Sure do miss that::: especially this weekend. Miss the Boom ... Go Hawks!!!,George Peters,It’s a tradition I was very honored to have taken part in for the last three years,Get your protocols and testing going and maybe in 2022. I have a precious jewel there.,Until then::: let’s Virtually Wave at Wave on::: Iowa every Saturday at 1pm. See you there!,I was there at the first wave! Gave me goose bumps!,I did this for the first time last year when my daughter was a freshman. Brought me to tears it was so powerful seeing those families wave from the top floor and realizing what they're going through. 😢💕,Maybe get the team together and wave since there aren’t going to be games. Hopefully you do something for these kiddos!!!,Andy Shives,Inayat Baloch,Thank you to the one lady that posted the idea on social media pages and all the fans that followed through on the idea,You can still make $ donations which will help families a great deal. Send a pic of u waving with a check!,"""""IT'S GREAT TO BE A HAWKEYE""""",Go hawks! Can’t wait to see you again!,"THANK GOD there is no football this year in IC! Praising brainless footballers that have absolutely no grey matter between their ears!... creatures that have no capability of contributing anything of worth to society!

""The universe is one and has no boundaries of possession""

""Both the microcosm and the grand universe must go together""

""The concept of truthful property by providence and the concept of political property are different::: and the concept of truthful community and that of political community are different.""

The deprivation of land on this earth::: which was rented for a point in the beginning of the universe::: continues for thousands of years::: the deprivation of the sea continues::: and the deprivation of the sky. This means that the real master is silent::: but the master is silent::: and the master does not know the masterless land::: the masterless sea::: and the masterless sky.

Everyone in the world has to draw a line on the land::: the sea::: and the sky without a master::: and for thousands of years each other must awaken and start awakening as to whether it is right. There is only one important way to fundamentally solve this sky::: earth::: and sea stealing game. In other words::: the whole universe::: the whole earth::: the whole mankind::: the whole space::: the true truth of the fundamental universe creation providence must first be realized.

In other words::: not everyone in this world thinks about the truthful and true reason of that one important providence::: but immersed in the reason that everyone::: regardless of whom::: rushes and splits everything up for my own benefit first. There is. Rather than living like that::: it means that everyone should let go of their greed over a certain one::: do not dispute::: and live with a single::: communal reason that a group wants to share together.

Therefore::: humanity must realize that it has been passed on for hundreds of millions of years::: leading to one family and one brother::: one family from one ancestor::: through this universal providence::: truth::: and order. As a result::: beyond the boundaries of the earth::: the sea::: and the sky::: the boundaries of the region::: the borders of the nation::: the borders of the country::: the world must live with the concept of the Han country::: the same words as the Han village::: one family::: one brother.

Now::: in the 21st century::: it is time to live with always foresight that a more splendid new civilization may be created depending on the choice of our humanity::: which is the primacy of all things::: or::: on the contrary::: that all can disappear and fall into a dark world at once. Came. In other words::: it is a story that we can open a new era of peace for mankind with a high level of warrant of all things.

Therefore::: all the people of the world do not deviate from the collective perception of the concept of the whole universe as one of the roots::: the whole world::: the whole earth::: the whole human being::: as an integral community of the universe as a community of all things::: as a community of all things::: as a community of humanity::: as a community of space. We must make sure that we comply with the providence and truthful order of the creation of the universe::: and continue to create a new life that is beautiful and peaceful::: wise and wise::: which is the end of all things.

This is for the real world peace::: which is the duty of mankind on this planet to prepare for and promote it. To this end::: people from all over the world must start with the end of a global intercontinenta
l federation system centered on the United Nations and a peaceful cooperative partnership that forms a link between the countries of each continent. It is important to realize that world peace does not just come by itself. In other words::: it means the seven stages of world peace.

Gentle World / Lee In-seop

The space is so beautiful
I can see everything in the world
I can see the life of all things
It is the movement of the whole universe

Space is all money
The space yields silently
Anything is done in space
Everyone gathers in space

The world moves into space
Moving back into space
Space is a treasure trove
The future of all things is space

One footstep of mine goes out into space
My thoughts pour out of the space
My heart goes out into space
I meet all my things in space

Space allows movement
Make your mind and mind play
Dancing intangible substances
It is a park of speech::: sound::: power::: and material.

From space to space again today
With one thought and one heart ahead
Seeing everyone wandering in space

There are plenty areas where the instructors have not a single clue and are teaching BS to the ignorant students!

These instructors have no real world experience and are teaching worn out ideas they learned from worn out ideas from teachers with no real world experience teaching out dated information. And it seems that cycle never stops! And that perpetuating ignorance is the staple of those grad departments.

Send your love to our Hawkeyes who are wrapping up the first day of classes for the fall semester.,2020-08-24 17:25:00,Dr. Patrick W. Hitchon intentionally paralyzed me. UIHC lied to cover his wicked acts.,As a parent 8 hours away::: I am just wondering what is the University of Iowa doing to keep the kids safe? What is the university doing today to ensure that the Covid positive kids are truly OK::: physically? I thought when the university said they had dorms set aside for Covid positive students::: I thought they meant like a whole dorm building. Instead::: they have “isolation” rooms in a wing set aside in dorm buildings that house non-Covid positive students. My son has told me that all the Covid rooms in several dorms are already full. Believe me::: he knows first hand 😢. Also::: these kids are told to grab some clothes and hike across the campus with whatever they can take with them to a Covid isolation room. They are provided a bed::: dresser::: desk::: refrigerator and microwave but no tv. These kids have to stay in these rooms for approximately 10+ days without a tv. Of course they can’t carry their own tvs from across the campus. Then::: even though they may have an unlimited dining plan::: they are given their meals once per day and it is a very very limited menu::: with many items most kids wouldn’t eat. Housing and Dining does a wellness check every am. What about a member of the medical or nursing staff performing the wellness checks. What happens if they need help and can’t call?The school is isolating these kids::: they need to be checking on them quite a bit more than once per day and they should have access to calling in and having their food delivered to them....fresh::: hot food! My child said he got food delivered today but won’t get food delivered until Saturday. Is he not going to eat tomorrow? Honestly::: UI is not prepared for this pandemic and kids should not be on campus. Also::: what are mild symptoms vs moderate or severe? Is a 103 fever considered a mild symptom? These kids are kids and they need to be monitored and not just from a phone or someone dropping off their meals for the day! Not all of the positive kids were out partying. Covid is airborne!,"Trump:::

Now they get stingy with Americans that need help the most—a bandaid that should not be ripped off prematurely.

You are number one with this Mom and grandma. 💕🙏,"The 21st century is the first century of world peace.

The 21st century is the first century of world history and world peace. All humanity in the global village must live according to the Creator's providence given by the universe law.

For this

The first step is to hold a world-wide World Peace Advancement Competition with the same concept as the Olympic Games::: where all the world's leaders participate together under the leadership of the United Nations.

The second step is to establish the headquarters of the World Humanities Education Center to restore the humanity of people all over the world in order to restore the nature of the birth of mankind in the creation of the universe. .

In the third stage::: the world must establish a new mutual peace partnership with each other according to the rules established by each country and the United Nations.

In the fourth stage::: the United Nations (UN) must establish a new mutual peace partnership with each other between the continents of the world (adjustable from 6 to 8 continents) according to the rules established by the United Nations.

In the fifth stage::: with the structural reform of the United Nations (UN)::: the world government representing the global humanity of the world-centered United Nations (UN) of a new birth was born into a world government representative of the United Nations (UN). Is to implement the Peace Confederation of World Continents.

Finallyᆢ

In the sixth stage::: the global village that represents the newly established United Nations-centere
d World Federation for Peace by the World Continent and the new global government's operation plan in the short and long term will be announced. We need to create an opportunity for the launch of the unified government and the opening of the World Peace Festival where people from all over the world live together.

If Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany::: RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel::: Vice President Mike Pence::: his wife Karen & President Donald J. Trump vote by mail::: every American should be able to::: too!

It kind of screws up the plans to hack voting machines and to close voting sites when people all vote by mail.

When his country needed a leader::: Donald Trump turned off the lights and hid in his bunker.

HE’S NOT WELL. HE’S WEAK; LACKS CHARACTER::: MORALITY AND PRINCIPLES. HE THINKS HE’S ABOVE THE LAW. HE’S DAMAGED::: CORRUPT::: DANGEROUS. HE’S STUCK::: PINNED DOWN::: BOUND::: AND UNABLE TO MOVE FORWARD.

“Trump to replace SDNY prosecutor with lawyer who defended Deutsche Bank from money laundering scandal. On Friday night::: the Attorney General William Barr announced that Geoffrey Berman::: the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York::: will be stepping down. His replacement will be Jay Clayton — who previously represented Deutsche Bank::: one of President Donald Trump’s most significant business creditors::: from allegations they facilitated Russian money laundering.” – Matthew Chapman

Shadowy figures lurking in government hallways.

“At least four members of Congress have reaped benefits in some way from the half-trillion-d
ollar small-business loan program they helped create. Republicans on the list include Rep. Roger Williams of Texas::: a wealthy businessman who owns auto dealerships::: body shops and car washes::: and Rep. Vicky Hartzler of Missouri::: whose family owns multiple farms and equipment suppliers across the Midwest. And there are almost certainly more::: according to aides and lawmakers::: but …the Trump administration is refusing to provide any details. Democrats have tried to pry free the list of recipients. But their push in the House to require disclosure of at least some companies was blocked on the floor late last month by Republicans — including Williams and Hartzler. Spokespeople for Williams and Hartzler declined to say how much money was provided under the loans to the privately held companies lawmakers own.” - By SARAH FERRIS::: MELANIE ZANONA and ZACHARY WARMBRODT

Fake audience for Trump’s rally? OMG::: is this true?
“Actors Needed June 20 (Tulsa).
Third ST near Denver AVE. Excited and enthusiastic MINORITY Actors and Actresses needed to hold signs at event in Tulsa. Send headshot/
resume for early consideration. *This may be applied towards community service if necessary (in lieu of payment). do NOT contact me with unsolicited services or offers. Compensation: 10.00.” Post id: 7141828474 © craigslist.

THIS CONFIRMS WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW ABOUT DONALD J. TRUMP’S RUSH TO REOPEN THE COUNTRY; HE DOESN’T CARE ABOUT THE HEALTH AND LIVES OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE:

“Trump campaign says it can't be held liable if rally attendees contract Coronavirus. Attendees of President Donald Trump's upcoming rally in Tulsa::: Oklahoma::: must agree not to sue the campaign if they contract coronavirus. Rallygoers are asked to RSVP to gain admission to the event and by registering::: they must agree to a disclaimer that states they acknowledge the ‘inherent risk of exposure to COVID-19 exists in any public place where people are present.’
‘By attending the Rally::: you and any guests voluntarily assume all risks related to exposure to COVID-19 and agree not to hold Donald J. Trump for President::: Inc.; BOK Center; ASM Global; or any of their affiliates::: directors::: officers::: employees::: agents::: contractors::: or volunteers liable for any illness or injury:::’ the disclaimer reads.”- Ryan Nobles

WHY WOULD ANY AMERICAN SUPPORT A MAN WHO HIDES BEHIND A DOUBLE FENCE::: BARRICADING HIMSELF INSIDE THE (PUBLICLY OWNED) WHITE HOUSE::: KEEPING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AWAY FROM HIM? BY KEEPING HIMSELF INSIDE THE FORTRESS::: TRUMP IS ABDICATING HIS POWERS AND HIS ROLE AS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.

On June 1st::: Bunker Boy (why does he ALWAYS have to lie about everything?) Donald J. Trump spoke with Vladimir Putin and hours later he gassed people and told Americans he'd be sending the military police all over the country.

Extreme Right group operating under the name::: Proud Boys::: “discussed injuring and even killing their adversaries::: plotting tactics and optics for months in order to assert a claim of self-defense should they face charges. The punch-happy::: pro-Trump street gang was particularly excited for its “Resist Marxism” rally::: scheduled for April 6 in Providence::: Rhode Island. With the right plan of attack::: members said::: this one could put them back on the map. Proud Boys premeditate violence they hope to commit. They spent months before the April rally meticulously planning strategies for injuring protesters. The Proud Boys repeatedly acknowledge that their plans could get them in trouble. ‘I advise all of you to only speak in terms of self-defense and never speak of premeditated violence:::’ wrote a man who identified himself as Kyle ‘Based Stickman’ Chapman::: an extremist who has previously been convicted of violent felonies and is known for his attacks at rallies and repeated parole violations::: among other crimes.” – Andy Campbell

"Today::: we commemorate Juneteenth::: the day that the last of the kidnapped and enslaved Black people and African people were freed in these United States.

Diversity at Iowa
June 19::: 2020 at 8:01 AM ·

Today::: we commemorate Juneteenth::: the day that the last of the kidnapped and enslaved Black people and African people were freed in these United States. Though physically emancipated::: our Black communities will never truly be free until Black bodies::: souls::: and minds in this country can wake up without the fear that their life will be ended too early::: without every day facing the trauma of a history that includes their enslavement::: and without having to live in a system that is built to work against them. Let us both remember this day and never forget that there is yet more work to do.
For more information on Juneteenth::: please go here: https://www.history.com/news/what-is-juneteenth?fbclid=IwAR2EqckEIM178tcsX9qGpfVU9666ThF-7fnl92nnrIT0qBsrimsX6U2Qcgk

Little has changed since 1969.,<3,Just would like everyone to know that slavery was still legal and practiced in Kentucky and Delaware until December 6th::: 1865. While juneteenth is used to celebrate the fact that no one is free until every one is free::: it was not the last day of slavery. One could argue that slavery still exists today in our prisons from labor exploitations to large corporations such as walmart.,"""Let us both remember this day and never forget that there is yet more work to do.""

With the holidays quickly approaching::: OU Health Services is offering COVID-19 tests to ensure our OU community has a safe Thanksgiving spent with family and friends.  Masks are required at all times while inside Goddard Health Center.  Learn more at http://healthservices.ou.edu,2021-11-16 17:42:28,Are the tests free? My son was told there is a cost for the test.,Perhaps::: it's time to educate the educators and to state an opinion. Many feel that flu & virus season is a real thing. Well::: I'm afraid I have to disagree::: and here is something to consider. Folks get less exercise during the winter months and stay covered up::: getting less vitamin D from the sun than during the summer months. On colder days::: people tend to stay indoors rather than spread out in the open air. Healthy foods such as fruit::: avocado::: etc.::: are less prevalent. There are more Sugar fest days upon us in the fall & winter months. All these factors play a significant role in causing the immune system to become weakened. Our immune system is no different than a muscle in the body::: and if you fail to exercise::: you're going to lose muscle mass and strength. While staying indoors::: we tend to be less exposed to various pathogens::: and we are not exercising our immune systems::: which keep the system robust. Hence::: fall and winter are not really flu & virus seasons::: but it is a Weakened Immune System Season. Bacteria and viruses are with us all year long::: and it's us who are the problem rather than the pathogens we come in contact with. Rather than get a COVID-19 test::: why not test the entire immune system to see if you're body can withstand any and all viruses including COVID-19? It's called an Access Immune Panel. This one test covers so much about your immune system. Here is what is tested. Cost::: $199. ********* ~Access Custom Immune Panel~ What blood markers are included in this test? 00142 CEA **** Lymphocyte Subset 1 Panel (breakdown): % Dual CD56/CD16 Absolute Dual CD56/CD16 WBC Total Lymphocyte % Total Lymphocyte Count % CD3 (Mature T-Cells) Absolute CD3 % CD4 (Helper/ Inducer) Absolute CD8 CD4/CD8 Ratio % CD19 (Earliest B-Cells) Absolute CD19 CBC w/Diff CBC: WBC - WHITE BLOOD CELLS RBC - RED BLOOD CELLS HEMA - HEMATOCRIT HEMO – HEMOGLOBIN MCV MCH MCHC PLATELET COUNT RDW MPW *** Differential : GRANULOCYTE % LYMPHOCYTE % MONCYTE % BASOPHIL % GRANULOCYTE # LYMPHOCYTE # MONCYTE # BASOPHIL #,Dorothy Clark,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Absolutely killed it. That was a smart play taking the ball like that towards the end. A win is a win especially when you got a playmaker in Caleb. BOOMER SOONER!!!,Will the defense be coming to next weeks game???,All these 4 and 5 star recruits can't tackle Can't block can't cover that is 100% on the coaches. Iowa St::: Baylor and OSU will torch us if they can't figure out a way to do the basics. Time for coaches to start earning those big time salaries,First time since 04,Just please lose these uniforms OU! BOOMER SOONER!,Win is a win!!! Usual Sooner Ball!!,OU starts like they did today against Baylor::: OSU::: or Iowa State they will get beat. Better up the intensity a lot!,and the slow descent into a playoff spanking continues,Not to seem ungrateful::: but would it kill you to cover a spread?,Let's be honest. The OU offensive line is a mediocre unit at best that can't block their assignments. The OU defensive line just flat out has no heart. They lack the attitude needed to play defense at a high level.,Tara Scott,It would be nice to see you play both halves instead of just One!,Caleb magic! 🎩 ✨🪄,This feels more like a loss than a win🤷🏻‍♂️,Yeah::: they almost ran out of luck again::: defense needs to step up their game::: too many penalties::: resulting in huge amt of yardage!!,If they would play 4 quarters of football::: they would be untouchable. BOOMER!,Y’all almost lost this game if the offense never showed up,Fire grinch,Sure wish he didn't do this as he runs across the goal line!,Awesome!!!!!!,Yea::: Sooners,I wish I was locked out of this sight :::this is embarrassing,again '0' defense,BOOMER,We better wake up. OSU has the second best defense in the big 12. Guess what::: OU isn’t number one in defense. Kansas is the worst in big 12 in defense and they controlled most the game.,Well....

Which was just more white people stealing the land natives were already forced on to because their land had already been stolen once. Literally like everyday the mascot spits in the face of indigenous people. Mind you I have been an OU fan my entire life but this has always been an issue. Racism is a major issue. Hell i remember being in elementary school right here in OKC and us being taught the land run was a good thing. I remember celebrating it trying to get the most prized picnic table at recess because different tables had different game setup different food at the table. They basically made little kids compete against each other as to who could steal the best land from land that was already stolen two times over as little kids. Hell there's still a monument outside of Bass Pro shop. The wife and I got surrounded by Confederate flag waiving weapon carrying racist at an Indigenous/BLM rally just a year ago to protest that very Landrun monument. We still have open boarding schools. Texas is trying to overturn ICWA which protects indigenous kids nationally. Ol Stitt had it out for the tribes his entire term in office but we're supposed to praise OU for allowing indigenous people to dance only for them to use it as a PR stunt on social media? If OU really cared they would change the mascot name::: fight to end boarding school::: use there power of the partnership with TU to protect ICWA::: they would invest heavily in renewable resources so corporations would have zero reason to attack indigenous people just protecting their land and water. You know things that would actually make a difference. Smh. The gatekeepers are still gatekeeping.,I just love all the people clinging to a holiday they don't /actually/ care about::: they just don't want to acknowledge Columbus was an idiotic genocidal monster that caused countless deaths to native americans for generations. The idiot didn't even land on the continental US::: he landed in like Haiti. Why he's praised as some American hero is beyond me.  Happy indigenous peoples day!,Happy Columbus Day!,Support,Thanks guys,AWESOME!!!!!,KD Koslowsky,Columbus Day,It’s Columbus Day you twits,You do realize that the tribes also practiced slavery in their earlier years and their method of expanding their wealth and territory was by attacking weaker tribes? They are just like most civilizations throughout history.,I'm sure they really want a day designated by dopey to remind them of ? a designated day ! WOW,And just what did we learn today????,If I remember -\-\ they lost the war -\-\- wth,They're native Americans. I shall call you chief fir you brought honor to your people,IT IS COLUMBUS DAY.,Alot of racists on this page!,University of Wokelahoma,Happy Columbus Day,Wow. Look at all the racists in these comments. Don’t you all have NephSon’s to take care of?,Dan Thomas,#LetsGoBrandon,Any classwork today?,"Look at all the ""Columbus Day"" snowflakes 🤣",what ever floats your boat on Columbus Day,To all the people saying Happy Columbus Day: are you that racist you can’t just celebrate and uplift indigenous people who endured a genocide? Especially for a state full of native Americans and their stolen land.,Love this!!!,To all the tribes and to all the Italians happy Native American day and happy Columbus Day!!!!! Now wasn't that easy lmao The Woke need to wake up and read history LMAO,*Columbus,Daniel,Happy Columbus Day!!! If you woke::: you a joke!!!!,Thanks Christopher Columbus! If not for you::: we'd still be a bunch of tribes.,Madelynn Keller,Angye Tilley::: weren’t you a part of this::: one year?,People still living in a time they had nothing to do with,HAPPY COLUMBUS DAY!!!,Happy Columbus Day to you too!,What about Columbus Day???,Woke is 💩,Why is it that native Americans get 1 day? But others get a mouth hmmm,Beautiful!!,Columbus Day.,BOOMER ♦️♦️♦️,Love it,Happy Columbus Day!!!,Lorac LO,Happy Christopher Columbus day.,There’s no issue with Indigenous Peoples Day. Except that it’s on Columbus Day! Just move it off this day and we can have both without a battle.,I hope you are also celebrating Columbus Day that has been a NATIONAL HOLIDAY for over 100 years.,You mean Columbus day?,Ryan Brumbelow is this when you saw the Pow Wow?,Happy Columbus Day!,Except genetic research has proven all humans originated in Africa. As a so-called research institution you should stop misusing the term::: indigenous. Class dismissed.,"Fun facts for Columbus day: Christopher Columbus::: an Italian explorer::: didn't discover the U.S. He discovered the Bahamas and Haiti::: which he claimed in honor of Spain. ""Columbus Day"" was declared a national holiday by President Harrison in 1892 after 11 Italian-America n immigrants were murdered by a mob in New Orleans. Columbus Day is a celebration of Italian Heritage::: not a celebration of the genocide and wars that were brought to North America by other nations long after Columbus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

How about recipes for healthy food options instead of the fast food we consume that turns us into complete garbage.  Anything but covid.  It isn't the only thing that exists.  People are dying- yes.

Is THAT free speech still welcome? #oualum,Most of the people in this comments section might want to consider participating in this event because it is very clear that you have absolutely no idea what freedom of speech means.,I hope so::: but seems OU Admin and Professors have more conservatives on restrictive speech through grade intimidation than anything else!!,I truly believe most of the OU student body::: by this advertisement::: will think ‘free speech’ is only allowed one week out of the year.😂,Might want to instruct your professors on it first::: because they deny it the most,Mmm - Im fervently hoping this is not an indicator that OU does not permit free speech the other 51 weeks a year,Happy Free Speech (as long as we agree with you and nobody is offended) Week 😬,Jay McKinley,"I love all the morons commenting::: ""free speech should be year round.""

Free speech is a LIFE LONG RIGHT as an American Citizen!,Well OK::: I hope they mean that,Should have started it this week so that “Horns Down” isn’t a penalty,If this gets canceled!😆,This is a little ironic when your professors don’t even give their students free speech.

How about tryin' it every day?,Shanelle Williams is the real mvp in this thread.,As long as you wear a mask and can’t speak properly 🤣,Somehow I doubt that the use of “the N-word” will be allowed to be spoken freely::: unless the person uttering it is Black.,Shouldn't every week be free speech ?,🤣😂🤣😂😅,The University of Oklahoma::: Granted A Week For Free Speech? wow::: we're impressed.﻿🤦🏻 and we thought this Freedom was granted by God as Free Will.

Mask up in class and get vaccinated today. For more information::: visit ou.edu/together.,2021-09-09 15:02:12,The CFC lacks credibility in the eyes of many who haven’t been vaccinated. Forcing folks doesn’t work. Why do Universities not understand this? It amazes me how clueless many in academia are when it comes to psychology and human behavior.,"PrOUd of the leadership of my alma mater. ❤️ When personal health choices harm others::: it's a matter of public health::: not individual rights. We have yielded to vaccine requirements in schools and the workplace for over a century for this very reason. In the US people of age are free to consume as much alcohol as they want::: impair::: and even poison themselves to death. They are not::: however::: allowed to take their personal recklessness into the public where it can harm others. The public has a RIGHT not to share roads and other public spaces with those whose choices can cause injury and even death to others::: so we have rules protecting the public from the potentially harmful personal choices of others. The public has a RIGHT to be able to have access to hospitals and practitioners who have space available to treat them for their many types of health ailments. The public has a RIGHT to be able to send students to open schools safely without the threat of lifelong health compromise or worse.  To those citing religious conviction and protective trust in God::: I trust my Lord and Savior to equip His children with the discernment needed to navigate the pitfalls of this world::: and I trust His word. God's word is very clear about thinking of others before ourselves: ""Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit::: but in humility regard others as better than yourselves. Each of you should look not only to your own interests::: but also to the interests of others. Let the same mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus."" -\-\ Philippians 2:1-5 ⁠ ""Do not seek your own good::: but seek the good of your neighbor."" -\-\ 1 Corinthians 10:24 ⁠ ""You shall love your neighbor as yourself."" -\-\ Mark 12:31 ⁠ And more directly::: Paul addressed the Corinthians::: ""Therefore concerning the eating of things offered to idols::: we know that an idol is nothing in the world::: and that there is no other God but one...but beware lest somehow this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to those who are weak....Therefo re::: if food makes my brother stumble::: I will never again eat meat::: lest I make my brother stumble."" -\-\ 1 Corinthians 8:4::: 9 and 13. Again in Galatians 5:13 Paul tells us::: ""You::: my brothers and sisters::: were called to be free. But do not use your freedom to indulge the flesh; rather::: serve one another humbly in love."" ⁠ Paul says that while we may have the right to do something::: it doesn't mean it's right to do it. Our decisions should be made with the good of others in mind and not our own personal rights.  I guess these are the sorts of things I think about when folks clamor about their “God given rights"". I don't feel God calls for His people to worship the trinity of Me::: Myself and I. To the contrary::: this type of individualism runs contrary to the very tenets of the Christian faith.",A whole lot of ME::: ME::: ME on this post. A little more We would be cool::: but we are too busy being political.  Embarrassing.,How about you let ppl decide for themselves,Do what YOU want with your body!!,Students have to wear masks in class but 90:::000 can pack the stadium for football games without masks? Masks don’t work. Masks shouldn’t be required at all.,Looks like the antivaxers are out in full force.,I have read almost all of the ignorant responses. If you do not like OU or their “views” then unfollow The University::: cancel your support::: and please do not send your children to OU. You are selfish and inconsiderate of others. The University is trying to provide a safe and healthy environment so that students can continue to attend and the faculty and staff can continue to educate.,Mary Sue Aasheim,Just say no,If a young person is smart enough to go to college::: he should be able to research the facts and make up his mind what is best for him. Sending things like this suggest we have students who don’t belong in college. It’s embarrassing.,No thanks! We will opting out of that!,No,Is Fauci running this account?,Actually it would be best if everyone wears a hazmat suit all day every day. Thank you for being part of the solution.,No,Why? They will still get the MU Varient!,No,Their bodies::: their choice. P.S. I stole that from the democrats. 🤪🤪,I’m glad OU is at least a shining example of what to do in a wasteland of idiots.,I support OU’s efforts to keep our students safe based on available scientific evidence. Anyone’s ignorance and selfishness is unwelcome and dangerous.,Sad thing is many of these students actually believe this is based on science.,A lot of people on this thread who aren't wanting to follow guidelines are going to be the same ones big mad when school is forced back online because of the spread.,Dylan Ward Cunningham I did for 28 years,Every one who is upset about masks and the vaccine should go work at a hospital.  Bunch of babies 👶🏻,Or students could choose what’s best for them 🤷🏽‍♂️ instead of forcing,You can tell by reading these comments which posters graduated from OU::: and which are just fanboys.,Stick with being the Premier Meteorology/ weather prediction school... And leave the junk science to Texas...,You don't need masks and most young people don't necessarily need a vaccine especially if they've developed natural immunity from exposure... OU needs to drop this garbage policy based on fear. If I were a student I wouldn't do either and I'd be just fine.,Great advice! Thank you so much!!,Shame on you::: OU for pushing this vaccine non-sense on your students. To think that I spend TENS of thousands of bucks on education at OU. SHAME ON YOU::: OU.,No thanks.,When did OU become such a radical leftist racists school.,https:// freebeacon.com/ coronavirus/ d-c-exempts-lawm akers-governmen t-employees-fro m-new-mask-orde r/,NEVER!!!!,Nah I dont think so,Didn't go to college but would gladly walk away from a scholarship at OU over this fear driven planneddemic.,Ryan Adams,Aaron Morris am I reading this right…,When will higher education actually use the science to educate about natural immunity::: Covid particles being small enough to get through masks::: masks being a bacteria haven that can have long term effects::: and what about therapeutic drugs that work. How about the fact that there is a 99.7% survival rate overall and with students it’s like 99.999999%. You know what masks will prevent? They prevent children and young adults from building a strong robust immunity to many infections. The fact that you’re misleading people is very troubling. The fact that you’re not educating your students about the side affects of the vaccines is not just troubling but it borders on criminal.,For those who tell you that the Covid-19 injection is authorised::: approved or licensed remind them of these facts::: especially if they are considering that the C19 injection is a good idea for children:  The injections are still in Stage 3 Clinical Trials that do not finish until early 2023:  Currently given emergency approval (EUA)::: Conditional Marketing Authorisation (CMA) etc all these terms mean they are only being used because of an “emergency” situation.

Oklahoma Football 4 September 2021 г.::: 13:46 ·  1️⃣-0️⃣  #OUDNA,2021-09-04 20:01:02,Pitiful game boys. Fire Grinch. You're gonna have to play defense in the SEC,Maybe tell them boys to quit worrying about how much they can make with their brand and focus on football.,We have work to do….. hopefully we don’t drop too far in the rankings,Sloppy from the kickoff. Doesn't look like a National Champion caliber team.,"sad::: i turned off at 40-22::: it already had the look of ""one of those games"" where we either look like a 5a team or meagerly beat an opponent who should be down 6tds",Win is a win::: but so much work to do. No way we’re the #2 team in the country right now.,Game 1.... it's just 1 game... learn from this... improve and just get better every week.. been here before::: nothing new.. JUST WIN!!!,Barely::: by the skin of our terth,Well lots to improve on boys. The defense was not what I had hoped for. You want the SEC going to have to play better. Will see how the season goes.,Lots of work to do. Many areas of concern for a team full of expectations. Get back out there and prep for your next outing.,The talent is there:::but the coaching staff isn't::: squeaked by this one:::won't be #2 for long::: if this continues,Think about this....as of right now UCLA is way tougher than OU,Lincoln needs to learn how to call plays after the 2nd quarter. Rattler needs to get over the yips or just put Caleb in. He was the better Qb in spring-camps.,Typical OU second half letdown. We need to get better::: fast,They did not play like number 2 or 3 team on Sat.,I have to say I'm a diehard Sooner fan and I was embarrassed of that game today and I saw nothing that even puts rattler in the Heisman Trophy running !,Almost gave this one away! Not impressed with Rattler. Not living up to all the that preceded him! And he is arrogant! But we are spoiled after the last few quarterbacks we have had. Hard acts to follow & Rattler is NOT!! He chokes all the time!,Rattler never looks sure of himself. Tulane’s QB looked more like a heisman front runner than Rattler did.,Good thing OU didn’t play a ranked team in their opener like other blue blood teams are doing today.,Scary poor performance for what was supposed to be a greatly improved defense. Lots of work needed YET AGAIN to be a viable contender 🤨,Way too close for comfort. I believe our #2 ranked boys have some serious work to do. I have faith that Riley will get them there.,Tulane played SMART. We did not Half the time we didn’t know where the Tulane receivers were and how did they get past our defensive line that looked to be a foot taller. ???????,Rattler's deep pass be giving me Landry Jones PTSD.,I expected better -\-\ hopefully the kinks are worked out. Def should not be ranked #2.,This “champion caliber defense” looked lost::: confused::: and poorly coached all day until the final drive. The offense showed some bright spots but Spencer didn’t look locked in at all. We didn’t even look like a top 10 team today::: much less the #2 in the country.,Terrible::: so disappointed. Never make it in the SEC!,Boomer!!!,Not much to brag about when they only won by 5 points to Tulane.,A great kick. Just a thought. Way can’t we have a two. Qb. For a while,Could’ve been and should’ve been a better game.,We played the second half with the same indifferent::: smug::: entitled mentality of a certain school in Austin.,At this point::: they are not a top 20 team.,nailgbiter of a game to the end,Not a game to be proud of. Time to put in some work this week. I think that game alone ruined OUr QB's Heisman chances.,OK. Now the rust is shaken off::: destroy Western Carolina!,This is NOT a top 10 team! It's sad to see our line so pathetic after being great for a decade. Couldn't even get 1 yard in 2 tries and even lost yards.,35 points to Tulane. good grief,We need to stop letting off the gas and coasting in the 2nd half!! We can put up 37 in the 1st half and 3 in the second! Lincoln has been notorious at giving up big leads since he’s been at Oklahoma!,Contrats to Tulane for a great game. However::: at this moment::: we are a mediocre football team.,“Diamond” Spencer Rattler was embarrassing! Maybe he needs some time on the bench. Then there’s the no show OU defense. Nothing new there. That mess won’t work in the SEC. Get busy Coach!,Win is a win but it shouldn’t have been close. Got lots of work to do,Saw no intensity from OU today. Either side of the ball,That's what happens when you believe your own hype.,Not gonna win SEC games kickin' field goals and giving up 35. Just sayin'.,We’re not even top 10 right now whole team is weak need to get it together,Out played and out coached...,Jay Scott the rankings are the last thing you should worry about. Barely getting by vs. Tulane is a bigger problem.,What a joke OU is! Over rated for sure.,If we are #2::: then Tulane has to be top 10.,I'm sorry I had to laugh::: they looked terrible ! I can't believe that's the gameplan that Riley came up with !!,Sloppy win.,Rough game.,#rattleristrash,Tim Hart,Impressive win OU,LUCKY,Winner OU👍,Eric Wolf,Gonna have to tighten up .,Teeth,Escaped with a win.,Sloppy.

OU Health 2 September 2021 г.::: 10:50 ·  There has been much disinformation about the effectiveness of cloth masks in slowing the spread of COVID-19. Cloth masks are effective because when you breath::: cough::: talk::: sneeze or sing::: COVID-19 virus travels through the air inside droplets – and cloth masks are effective at catching these droplets and aerosoles containing the virus. Learn more at OUHealth.com/COVID.,2021-09-02 17:38:13,Unbelievable the amount of scoffers on masks. No one said that masks are 100% effective. The masks greatly reduce the risk of transmission compared to not wearing one. It is a numbers game and I want the numbers on my side.,BS. Total BS,Masks are NOT required on campus or in the classroom::: thank you Governor Stitt!!,So::: what he’s saying is that only people who are sick need to wear masks? Otherwise::: they serve no purpose if they’re not catching droplets containing the virus.,I heard a professor kicked 6 students out of a discussion class today because they didn’t have masks! And they didn’t even have masks to give them!,If someone farts in the elevator or car and you can smell it the mask will not protect you from a virus.,I’m a mum of an international studying at the OU. Of course the masks help. They get wet so they are catching droplets. Yes maybe not all but some. Those few may just make the difference and for me that’s worth it. I can smile with my eyes and speak so none of my rights are lost. Until we turn a corner with people that want a vaccine getting it or science finds something better I really don’t see the problem.,Propaganda at its finest!!! There are thousands of doctors who completely disagree with this one!,If OU's Dr. is saying this why aren't masks mandated at OU and the game?,"No wonder we don't know who to believe::: every ""expert"" has a different opinion.",*aerosols,What a joke,Nope,LIES! Such a FOOL! OU you've become an embarrassment. I pray that you find your way with truth and integrity because both are absent! Disgrace.,Clown! Then why don't they wear them in surgery?,No disinformation. ... They have no protection value at all!! Stick to weather prediction and being the Best weather/ meteorology school in the World!!,Hahahaha <inhale> HAHAHAHAHAHA,Now if the virus would play by your rules and just be in droplets and not aerosolized::: your wishes would be granted. This idea has been debunked numerous times.,Droplets = condensation. Then people are consistently touch/adjust their masks and then touch everything else... so masks help?,I'm sure the Wuhan lab researchers were wearing cloth masks for safety then!,Masks are a joke! Just live and breath and get your vaccine::: if you want too! it is your right to say yes or no!,BS.,That is a limited thought process.

But first::: let's use the population of America over the past 50 years. In the 60s::: 6% of children had a Chronic Disease. This percentage rose to 12% in the 80s. Today::: 56% of the population of children have one or More Chronic Diseases. So::: we have this Genius doctor::: who no doubt attended a fine University such as OU to obtain his Ph.D. to take care of the population while working in the most advanced hospitals::: or super clinics::: using the most advanced equipment that the world has to offer. The facilities are the best and the world::: with the best-trained staff::: nurses::: and doctors. Hence::: please explain to us all How In Gods Heaven has the US Population gone from minimal diseases back in the 60s to 60% of the US population with one or More Chronic Diseases. I will tell you how. These Quakes::: like this doctor::: is a useless drone spurned from significant universities that get funding from Big Pharma and Big Agriculture industries. Their procedure is to diagnose you with a disease::: then Code your condition::: then prescribe a drug based on this code::: which::: in most cases::: for the rest of your life. Now::: I ask you. If you have 100 people take their vehicle to a mechanic shop to get something repaired::: then the mechanic shop sends out 60 of these vehicles out of the shop::: ""Not Fixed:::"" and in many cases having more issues than when it came into the shop. Would you continue to trust ad use this mechanic? Hell no::: you wouldn't! You don't even question these idiots why they are doing such a poor job. Shame. The next time you enter Walmart and see 100 people shopping::: realize 60 of them have a Chronic Disease because they have doctors such as the one who made this commercial selling you nonsense. The kicker is::: your taxes paid OU to get him to make this stupid recommendation. For all those who don't understand::: the population who had a Chronic Disease::: / Immune Compromised body::: due to poor and useless medical care::: DIED from a virus... Let that sink in. The truth is::: the virus was never the problem::: it was Always the Host that had the problem. A Strong host will fight off viruses and in most cases::: you will never even know you came in contact with a virus. https:// www.cdc.gov/ chronicdisease/ resources/ infographic/ chronic-diseases .htm",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Teach them that the US is an exceptional nation. It is The most giving nation of all. Teach them that we are a sovereign nation::: and that it is perfectly fine that there is a wall at the southern border. That wall represents all of our ancestors that immigrated to the US the proper/right way. Teach them that CRT is sick and twisted and will be no part of of the curriculum at OU. Teach them that their college teachers with a PhD only means they can teach a college class. Means very little in the real world. Lol,Can we watch this in its entirely after the fact? We would love to watch it!,Nothing is coming up. Is it over? Will there be a replay?,Nothing is coming up. Do we have to sign up for soonersports.tv to watch this (at a cost of 80 bucks)???,I was born in Oklahoma city but grew up in McAlester then when I was 5 we moved to OKC lived there til I 1993 then moved to Texas I am a dihard ou fan and my Best friend is too even though he is from Texas planning on going to ou for my music 🎵🎵🎵🎵 so excited hope to be heading to the university of Oklahoma next summer,My daughter is part of this class 🙂,The University of Oklahoma::: was this recorded?

OU announced today the #OUVaccinates Student Appreciation and Incentives Program offering OU-Norman students a chance to win a range of scholarships and OU Athletic season tickets for submitting their COVID-19 vaccine.  Learn how you can participate by visiting https://link.ou.edu/3AHIPZW.,2021-08-13 19:48:10,"I have liked this page for years::: but now I think I need to unfollow. It is not right to bribe students to submit that they have had the ""vaccine"" or even requiring this ""vaccine"" (it is actually risky gene therapy) in order to get scholarships. It is not even approved by the FDA (they won't approve it because there are effective treatments that can be used instead). It is sad that schools of higher education have apparently not researched this ""vaccine"" or the virus::: thoroughly. I am also ashamed that it is a school right here in Oklahoma. I thought Oklahoma would be the last state with common sense::: but this proves otherwise. That said::: I am thankful that I never went to this school. Goodbye OU!  By the way::: if anyone wants information on what I have researched regarding the virus and ""vaccine:::"" please comment. Someone has to research if others won't.",OU should mandate Covid vaccines::: just like they mandate all other vaccines: https:// www.ou.edu/ healthservices/ medical-services /immunizations,You can keep your scholarships and athletic tickets! My 2 who attend there most definitely will NOT be getting it! This is a whole new level of disgusting BS!,I truly don’t understand how we lived with the flu for so long and this virus has turned us all against each other! Vaccinated or not it’s not going anywhere. This is still America and we are free to make our own choice whether you agree or not. That’s what use to make us the greatest country on Earth. That is long gone unfortunately. Now we just blame everyone else for any problem we face. Has to be their fault can’t be mine and it’s applied to a virus that none of us no matter how hard anyone tries can control. As a Veteran and alumni this is hard to swallow. How quickly we are willing to turn on each other is a disgrace to everyone who has served this great nation. Many of which are still fully prepared to do so!,Why the hard push??? Incentives really??? This is ridiculous!,Nice work OU! Let’s get on top of this virus 👏🏼 It’s sad that you have to go to these lengths to encourage people to get vaccinated::: but given the type of response you’re getting in the comments it’s not surprising.,Great idea! Proud to be an alumna!,It's a true shame to bribe students when they should understand the why's without this,Parents and students will complain no matter what OU does. 1) have students wear masks::: people complain they can’t breathe 2) have students get vaccinated::: people complain their rights are violated 3) no mask/vaccine::: people complain when classes go online. If we want life to get back to normal::: we should get the vaccine that TRUMP DIRECTED SCIENTISTS to develop.,It’s a shame you have to incentivize something like this::: BUT great way to go about it!!!,And what about people who can’t get the vaccine for medical reasons🧐,Do you offer this for flu shots. Sounds like discrimination and bribery to me. Shame on you.,Will not be spending any more money to support OU.,How about all those with natural immunity?,Let's join the mentality of California and other states who have to BRIBE people to get these vaccines which we are being LIED TO about. They DO NOT stop the spread of covid. STOP BELIEVING ALL THE LIES.,All these hateful comments and to think that OU is probably just trying to do whatever they can to help keep our kids safe. Come on people. Stop getting so offended about stuff. When did this become the norm?,I remember when you had to have about twelve different vaccines to enroll at OU. Now we are all up in arms?,I was vaccinated for the measles and smallpox. Am I eligible?,How about prizes for non-obese students?,I think OU is doing all they can to keep the school open. From what I saw during move in::: it won’t take much for this virus to spread through the community quickly. Anything we can do so the kids have the chance to stay on campus::: attend classes in person and enjoy the year is appreciated.,Great idea OU::: and bonus points for being creative in ways to improve vaccination rates on campus!  It's disappointing to have to resort to rewarding making good health choices::: but here we are. For those complaining::: I highly doubt you ever attended OU::: and if you did::: then you need to retake basic biology and health classes.,I have a better idea.. Take your vitamins::: exercise::: and build up that immune system!,This is 100% disgusting! How about rewarding students who don’t get coerced::: follow real science::: and think for themselves? Pathetic.,Like the students are 5 years old and need a Cracker Jack treat? So sad OU. How about they learn to be adults and make decisions based on research::: parental guidance and oh::: maybe common sense.,Suddenly regretting the tens of thousands I paid OU for my 2 masters degrees 🙄,How about giving students free insulin and epi pens etc etc. If they need!!!,Cool. But just have courage and mandate vaccinations and masks for anyone on campus,as an alum::: i’m more worried that OU granted some of y’all degrees than i am of a voluntary incentive program,This is crazy. I never realized this college was so liberal when I paid out of state tuition for my child to go there. There was a different administration during that time. Is that the why we are now seeing such things as this?,Ridiculous-this is bribery for a vaccine that is not even FDA approved -come on guys -stand up for your rights -this is outrageous!!!,Sad.... no one give incentives or scholarships to get regular vaccines.. the flu shot or anything else but covid oh boy omg it's covid .... stupid....,Exploiting the students who are struggling financially and doesn’t have mommy and daddy to pay for classes! Nice!🤡,Sad::: but funny::: but serious....they 're not only using fear::: shame::: blame::: guilt::: threats::: prizes::: and the lotto among other things::: now its scholarships and tickets. I'm just like WOW!!!,All of these anti-vax comments are a prime example of what is wrong in Oklahoma's education system.,If this doesn’t spell discrimination I don’t know what does. They could also say::: “Hey if you have blonde hair and blue eyes come win prizes!”,"This must be what they mean when they say ""you either die a hero... or live long enough to see yourself become a villain"" cmon OU::: dont forget what state you're in",That is pure bribery just take your daily vitamins drink orange juice just saying,maybe if people didn’t spread fatal misinformation about a vaccine so bad like it’s a disease colleges wouldn’t have to incentivize it 🤷🏻‍♀️  got nobody to blame but yourselves for pushing institutions to this point trying to keep students safe  what’s shameful is that people have to be incentivized to practice basic safety  and for the record i don’t agree with it - i think it’s messy. i just think it’s funny that people want to blame everyone but themselves.,How about free tuition instead? Make it worth while for bribes....,Bribing the financially struggling students to vaccinate. Lol.  Are you sure you aren’t based out of California or New York?  Shameful act of woke-ness on display.,That's ridiculous doing anything you can to get more test subjects,Will absolutely never attend this school::: will never recommend it to anyone::: and will actively be teaching my children to chose places that don't bribe you to be in a social experiment. If I see that they endorse something::: I will go out of my way to avoid it. These schools and companies need to see how many of us do not agree with them!,Should’ve given them to the people who were first in line,I would much rather have these::: then to force all students.,Disgusting! Bribing people to risk their health for a football game. Sick.,Carrot on a stick. That’s not manipulative or coercive at all. Ever read the Nuremberg code?,"The comments on this post are what is wrong with the USA.  We can't even unite against a virus anymore.  ""United"" should be dropped from our name. It's more like the DSA....divided states of America.",Cassie Whisennand Owens,Sara Mitchell,Sara Mitchell,Educate yourself. Say no and boycott anyone requiring this. Follow the money 💯💴,Catherine Anne Duininck,Christin Bee Love,Type in #protectyourfami lies in the FB search bar to see real stories of the 💉 injuries/ deaths. Absolutely sickening that OU (& most universities) are pushing this on our children!,Kate Omstead!!♥️,Hannah Mattes,How nice of you to use bribery to convince students to take the jab! How much did the CDC::: Fauci and the Biden Administration pay you to do that???,Offering incentives to vaccinate is called bribery and coercion!!!! 😡🤮😡🤮 People need true informed consent::: not prizes and awards… that’s basic medical common sense.  https:// everlyreport.com / what-you-need-to -know-about-the -covid-vaccine/,Next they'll be hashtagging #OUVaccinatesKil lsStudents,https:// videopress.com/ v/p8r7ebPy,Oh heck no!!! No poison in my body!,Ew,Shame.,Love this!! ⭕️🙌,Go ahead and sell your birth right like esau did,Do prizes include myocarditis and heart failure?,Pathetic,One more comment /OU stand up /this is absurd!!!!!!!,Choose to vax or not... just get full informed consent of risks::: benefits and alternatives. Vax now has myocarditis warning on package inserts: https:// www.fda.gov/ news-events/ press-announceme nts/ coronavirus-covi d-19-update-jun e-25-2021?utm_m edium=email&utm _source=govdeli very; #TImetotalkthera peutics www.c19ivermect in.com,Kelly Scheurich,So they want to kill their students. Cool.,OU doing what they do,I LOVE my Alma Mater Kudos OU Not forcing anyone but incentives are great Still pro choice,Y’all are sickening tbh,Coercion and bribery at its finest.,Holy cow the people on here strait up being the snowflakes they seem to deride.,Keshia Oberg,They are paid to push this. They could care less if the shot hurts or kills you and they wont care for you nor attend your funeral https:// childrenshealthd efense.org/ wp-content/ uploads/ chd-notice-for-e ua-vaccines-6.4 .21.pdf,BOYCOTT OU NOW!,SMH 🤦‍♀️,Discrimination,Control,Get your vaccine::: don't be a fool.,This is how desperate they have become. What an absolutely joke. Healthy young people do not need to inject themselves with a big pharma product to stay healthy,The OU administration are sick in the head::: and no vaccine will cure their lust to hurt the youth. They love promoting a gene therapy that will undoubtedly present autoimmune issues in the future in young adults.,turn off the TV folks,Carlos Garza,Wow::: I thought this was a joke::: this is horrible..,Matt Roby Liberty Marie Hall Roby,Retired military here::: take the Anthrax vaccine the Army said. It’s safe::: the Army said. Six months after my final booster I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis. I was a fit::: heathy 31 year who got max scores on my fitness assessments. Oh but it had nothing to do with the Anthrax vaccine::: nothing at all. I was going to get RA anyway::: the vaccine had nothing to do with it🤡😂,This is shameful.....,Bribery!! Absolutely disgusting,Ridiculous. Bribery is not the answer,Get those kids vaccinated! Yes!,Gotta bribe people,What crap,Kayla Purdy 🙄🙄🙄🙄,This is disgusting,Stephen Clopton,That is coercion.,Well::: it must be kiss your sister month at OU.🤦‍♂️,Boy that is ridiculous,That’s just 100% wrong!!!!!!😡😡😡😡😡😡,Here's an idea::: take financial liability for those who die ir get a lifelong injury after getting the jab. Vaccine makers are making billions and have no liability for the 12:::436 who have died nor the thousands of people who have a lifelong injury because they thought it was safe.,The gig is up and y'all are found out. The rest of you blind believers in the. Unicorn covidian jab cult need to turn off the main stream news that is lying to you. Yes Covid is real::: but it can be treated at home and you don't need their jab. The jab won't keep you from getting covid::: spreading it or dying from it,Danette Saleeba Mondalek,Ridiculous….,Emily Brhel,Kyle Meyer,This is disturbing,McKenna Lytle,A precursor to the mark of the beast. Do your research and read your Bible.,This is a big disappointment OU…,This is disturbing lol.,You are bribing people as well.  Embarrassing. For you,Has anyone thought if all these People who are Vaccinated are getting infected by New Variant ::: Maybe there are no New Variant maybe the Vaccine doesn't Work and Scientist won't admit it...hmmmm,Disgusting.,😡,Despicable,My sis got both doses.

Thank goodness for Okhpr.com,“Show us your papers” What a joke.,Gifts for the compliant sheep!,Bravo🙌🏻,🤮🤢 Gross.,Why do I see 56 laughs here about getting vaccinated???

What do we get? We get Criticized for not getting it and we get told we are the problem! How stupid can the citizens of this country be? It’s a control thing!

The University of Oklahoma Board of Regents met today and unanimously authorized proceedings that allow the university to join the Southeastern Conference (SEC) in 2025.  Read more by visiting https://link.ou.edu/3xh2LRb.,2021-07-30 16:27:34,As an OU alum and 29 year football season ticket holder I’m ecstatic about joining the SEC conference. If you haven’t seen it yet please listen to the message delivered by President Harroz and AD Joe C at today’s BOR meeting. These gentlemen continue to lead ⭕️🙌🏻 on an elite level. Live On University ‼️,21 years since last NC in the Big 2...I mean Big 12. This should be interesting...,Guess no more championships on the horizon??,Oklahoma versus Vanderbilt! Giving the people what they want,From an Alabama fan welcome to the SEC::: the best conference in the country The University of Oklahoma ‼️,It really saddens me that the fair weather (bandwagon) fans are spouting their mouths and displaying their fundamental lack of understanding.  Bottom line is strength of schedule. If you want to be the best you have to beat the best.  Open your history books and look up Scott Frost. His team went undefeated. Did they win the national championship? Strength of schedule.,Fans are going to have to get used to the idea of not winning the conference every year. Gonna be interesting to see how this shoe fits.,Extremely ignorant move. Enjoy struggling to stay relevant while finishing 6th in the SEC West every year. You think OU would have learned from Nebraska about what happens when a mediocre school that used to be good gets too big for its britches.,"""2025""",The Big XII is so bad for Oklahoma … 🤷‍♂️ I guess winning conference championships and going to the National Championship series has been so disappointing. Also::: kids coming here with Heisman trophy aspirations must have been horrible decisions for them.  Some of us get the big picture … it’s all about the money now ... not championships.  I know some of you will disagree but history::: facts and logic proves me correct and the future for OU in the SEC will also. 😢,OU goes so they’re players can make more money::: which brings more money to the program.  Hard to say no when it’s no longer about football and everything about money.  Oh by the way::: once a student picks up endorsement deals::: that scholarship should be lost and given to a student who really needs it,Boo,Lane Travis Gritts,Lots of changes coming to college sports overall. It’ll be interesting to see what happens. Will the SEC grow to 20 teams and split into east/west? What happens to our traditional rivalry games? Hopefully good things for our school.,I .v been staded at ELS long time a go I .m looking for a student's pictures .... If there pleas send Many thanks....🙏,Congrats to The University of Oklahoma from a Ole Miss fan I just wanna say welcome to the sec! I have always followed ur football program and have nothing but respect for u guys. Hope to see a game in Norman one day,What about updating Covid protocols to match the CDC? That seems more important lately.,"I hate this. Really. Nebraska and Texas A&M both tried this. It killed so many traditions in terms of the OU-Nebraska game. Nebraska hasn't been a top 10 team in idk how long::: and it was a while before A&M made a bowl game. Now Bedlam may be gone? So that we can play Georgia and Alabama and get beat.....a lot. Ugh. I miss the years when it was really the Big ""12"". I can't believe I'm saying this::: but I may start rooting for OSU.",I wonder if Big-12 Commissioner Bob Bowlsby is aware of this?,If any part of the state you represent touches Colorado::: you do not belong in the Southeastern Conference.,Race and money rule sports today. I’m losing interest fast.,Of course it has the be the year after I graduate 😞,MONEY! Follow the money. Screw the people::: athletes::: and tradition. It's all money and politics now.,Dumb question: why wait four years?,Should we be concerned? Sooners' Football winning percentage against the SEC is 68%. https:// www.soonerstats. com/football/ opponents/ index.cfm?affili ation=SEC,I'm not exactly an Oklahoma fan. The State or the university of Oklahoma. The only time I watch the sooners is in the playoffs. That'll make a blind man wince. Anyway::: glad to have you. Wish you well.,Knowing the SEC is sure to add at least 4 more teams in the near future::: the Big12/AAC should form a 20-team merger:  POD 1: - Iowa State - Kansas State - Wichita State - Kansas  POD 2: - Oklahoma State - TCU - Texas Tech - Tulsa  POD 3: - Baylor - SMU - Houston - Tulane  POD 4: - Cincinnati - UCONN - West Virginia - Temple  POD 5: - UCF - USF - ECU - Memphis,"The only question is when. Do we wait for 2025 when the current television contract ends or pay the big buyout to leave early? I think the ""Sooner” the better for all parties involved. If a divorce is imminent::: is it better to get it done or drag it out and prolong the anguish?","START PAYING THESE BOYS. HEAD COACHES SIGNING CONTRACTS WITH 3 COMMA'S BUT ALL THESE BOYS GET IS A ""FREE EDUCATION""",Karen Rex Clauson,You gave the wrong year OU. You ment after this season is over? You guys should find more parking and tailgate space for the 2022 season.,Now lets play some real competition. Can’t wait.,Cory Johnson,Why of course::: follow the MONEY! 🤣,Here we go into a new era. See you soon Alabama. 😉,Baptism by Fire.... to be the best (national champions) you have to beat the Best (Alabama and LSU). The only way the Sooners are going to truly become elite..... become bigger::: stronger::: faster::: BADDER....,OU just showed what college sports are all about-\-\greed. Get ready to have a losing season. You've dominated Big XII because this conference has always been weak.,OU tired of being a big dog in a small yard and now wants to be a small dog in a big yard?,Boomer Sooner,Holy crap,Cory Johnson,I started not liking as much when SWC went 😳,I don't favor it.,Be careful what you wish for.,Still now you canot answered,Carole Hahm,I don't think this is a big mistake. But I sure as heck don't get it.,Better learn to play defense in the next four years.,This sucks. I'm a Sooner fan and I HATE the SEC.,Thursday they said that Oklahoma and Texas's contracts ran out this year. So why now does it say 2025?,As a Sooner alum living in Alabama this makes me very happy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Information in private messages 😜,Dear friends The reason that I recommend the video to friends is because this video can help us recognize the special situation that the world is facing.  The Communist Manifesto begins with the sentence::: “A specter is haunting Europe — the specter of communism.” The use of the term “specter” was not a whim on the part of Karl Marx.Instead::: it should be understood as a devil — an evil specter forged by hate::: degeneracy::: and other elemental forces in the universe.  The goal of this video is not to simply recount history::: but to understand how we can stop the devil from ever ruling the world again. This relies on each individual’s enlightenment::: proactive abandonment of evil::: and return to the traditions and way of life that the divine laid down for man.  The divine will triumph over the devil. Which side we stand on will determine our eternal destiny.  https:// www.ntd.com/ chapter-two-the- red-devils-stra tegy-to-destroy -mankind_434872 .html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I’m really happy to see OU continuing to create an inclusive and welcoming space.,Growing up and being raised in Oklahoma::: I definitely felt hopeless in moments when I was told I would never be hired for being gay::: never be accepted::: or even be loved.

Today marked a major step forward in Oklahoma health care as OU and University Hospitals Authority and Trust signed a historic agreement to merge their clinics and hospitals into Oklahoma’s first comprehensive academic health system – OU Health.  Learn more by visiting https://link.ou.edu/2SEZ8q2.,2021-06-29 22:01:53,Oklahoma needs more neurologists...,Reading I  Acts 12:1-11  In those days::: King Herod laid hands upon some members of the Church to harm them. He had James::: the brother of John::: killed by the sword::: and when he saw that this was pleasing to the Jews he proceeded to arrest Peter also. –It was the feast of Unleavened Bread.– He had him taken into custody and put in prison under the guard of four squads of four soldiers each. He intended to bring him before the people after Passover. Peter thus was being kept in prison::: but prayer by the Church was fervently being made to God on his behalf.  On the very night before Herod was to bring him to trial::: Peter::: secured by double chains::: was sleeping between two soldiers::: while outside the door guards kept watch on the prison. Suddenly the angel of the Lord stood by him and a light shone in the cell. He tapped Peter on the side and awakened him::: saying::: “Get up quickly.” The chains fell from his wrists. The angel said to him::: “Put on your belt and your sandals.” He did so. Then he said to him::: “Put on your cloak and follow me.” So he followed him out::: not realizing that what was happening through the angel was real; he thought he was seeing a vision. They passed the first guard::: then the second::: and came to the iron gate leading out to the city::: which opened for them by itself. They emerged and made their way down an alley::: and suddenly the angel left him. Then Peter recovered his senses and said::: “Now I know for certain that the Lord sent his angel and rescued me from the hand of Herod and from all that the Jewish people had been expecting.”  Primera lectura  Hch 12::: 1-11  En aquellos días::: el rey Herodes mandó apresar a algunos miembros de la Iglesia para maltratarlos. Mandó pasar a cuchillo a Santiago::: hermano de Juan::: y viendo que eso agradaba a los judíos::: también hizo apresar a Pedro. Esto sucedió durante los días de la fiesta de los panes Ázimos. Después de apresarlo::: lo hizo encarcelar y lo puso bajo la vigilancia de cuatro turnos de guardia::: de cuatro soldados cada turno. Su intención era hacerlo comparecer ante el pueblo después de la Pascua. Mientras Pedro estaba en la cárcel::: la comunidad no cesaba de orar a Dios por él.  La noche anterior al día en que Herodes iba a hacerlo comparecer ante el pueblo::: Pedro estaba durmiendo entre dos soldados::: atado con dos cadenas y los centinelas cuidaban la puerta de la prisión. De pronto apareció el ángel del Señor y el calabozo se llenó de luz. El ángel tocó a Pedro en el costado::: lo despertó y le dijo: “Levántate pronto”. Entonces las cadenas que le sujetaban las manos se le cayeron. El ángel le dijo: “Cíñete la túnica y ponte las sandalias”::: y Pedro obedeció. Después le dijo: “Ponte el manto y sígueme”. Pedro salió detrás de él::: sin saber si era verdad o no lo que el ángel hacía::: y le parecía más bien que estaba soñando. Pasaron el primero y el segundo puesto de guardia y llegaron a la puerta de hierro que daba a la calle. La puerta se abrió sola delante de ellos. Salieron y caminaron hasta la esquina de la calle y de pronto el ángel desapareció.  Entonces::: Pedro se dio cuenta de lo que pasaba y dijo: “Ahora sí estoy seguro de que el Señor envió a su ángel para librarme de las manos de Herodes y de todo cuanto el pueblo judío esperaba que me hicieran”.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Jesus said::: whoever comes to me will never hunger and whoever believes in me will never thirst.  I am the bread of life.  I am the light of the world.  I am the resurrection.  Know therefore that the Lord your God is God::: the faithful God who keeps covenant and steadfast love with those who love him and keep his commandments::: to a thousand generations.  Deuteronomy 7:9  We possess the prophetic message as something altogether reliable. Keep your attention closely fixed on it::: as you would on a lamp shining in a dark place until the first streaks of dawn appear and the morning star rises in your hearts. First you must understand this: their is no prophesy contained in Scripture which is a personal interpretation. Prophecy has never been put forward by man's willing it. It is rather that men impelled by the Holy Spirit have spoken under God's influence.  2 Peter 1:19-21,https:// thefederalist.co m/2021/06/23/ new-video-shows- university-of-o klahoma-faculty -teaching-how-t o-silence-and-p unish-problemat ic-conservative s/,If they were in the military its cause we've already been tested with a lifetime of anthrax shots and malaria meds...,https:// l.facebook.com/ l.php?u=https%3A %2F%2Fwww.thega tewaypundit.com %2F2021%2F06%2F university-okla homa-instructor s-trained-censo r-indoctrinate- students-video% 2F%3Ffbclid%3DI wAR0m3uvUdPpHXQ n5Cy2-GFrqvg6IF GRtN1QzCBJBnIYq G1LzI_qOoGSupMw &h=AT0n5mipBKJE vSRA47z_G-L3fuA VX9ArVtMjKIacBa RZ9u6-QrgC7S5Ir TtywGXIZElkAI7H P8QwDDwCnIYgCpb Vm4QlfO_vvTlmWv tWLzigYWdHIBiLT YSNPAov2gnsk0BY 91eePGAV&s=1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A diploma from OU is no longer worth the paper it’s printed on. BA in Liberal Studies. After reading the latest nonsense this morning regarding the volleyball player’s lawsuit::: I walked over and removed my framed diploma from the wall in my office. It is trash. I hope her lawsuit is successful and costs the University dearly. I am removing any reference of the University of Oklahoma from my resume as well as the Presidents Honor Roll designation. I received both because I worked my ass off as adult white student who wanted more and didn’t need or want handouts. I also paid my college loan back - all by myself by continuing to work my ass off. Academia continues to influence society in powerfully dangerous ways in their erroneous belief of enlightened intellect rather than recognize the careless ignorance of it all.

Happy Juneteenth to our #OUFamily.,2021-06-19 19:53:04,The state of Oklahoma has observed Juneteenth since 1994. What took the nation so long?,It's part of Texas history::: not US history. You want to change it to the correct date when Lincoln signed it into law::: not just when Texas found out.,Gospel Mt 6:24-34  Jesus said to his disciples: “No one can serve two masters. He will either hate one and love the other::: or be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.  “Therefore I tell you::: do not worry about your life::: what you will eat or drink::: or about your body::: what you will wear. Is not life more than food and the body more than clothing? Look at the birds in the sky; they do not sow or reap::: they gather nothing into barns::: yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are not you more important than they? Can any of you by worrying add a single moment to your life-span? Why are you anxious about clothes? Learn from the way the wild flowers grow. They do not work or spin. But I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was clothed like one of them. If God so clothes the grass of the field::: which grows today and is thrown into the oven tomorrow::: will he not much more provide for you::: O you of little faith? So do not worry and say::: ‘What are we to eat?’ or ‘What are we to drink?’ or ‘What are we to wear?’ All these things the pagans seek. Your heavenly Father knows that you need them all. But seek first the Kingdom of God and his righteousness::: and all these things will be given you besides. Do not worry about tomorrow; tomorrow will take care of itself. Sufficient for a day is its own evil.”,Why did the university wait until it became a legal holiday to recognize and celebrate it?👀,Laura Louise Baker,Steven Townley,You guys have a nice little fascist on your hands with Kasey Woody::: she should win the socialist of the year award couse big words she doesn’t like give her boo boos ..lets try this...shes a bigot and a killer of free speach...snowfl akes,Carol Bellow Peters,Responsorial Psalm 34:8-9::: 10-11::: 12-13  R.

In an effort to determine whether a mass grave discovered last fall is linked to the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre::: OU archaeologists are helping lead the process of exhuming the remains.  Read more by visiting https://link.ou.edu/3x0DP0A.,2021-06-07 15:12:05,At one point there was a story about a burial site on the Arkansas. That would have been a more likely spot for a mass burial. Placing the bodies in a cemetery would not be my first choice if I had been involved and I sure as hell wouldn't put the bodies in caskets. More likely there was a hole dug somewhere where the bodies would have been dumped.,Very very sick of hearing about the riot. If you want to hear about a MASSACRE::: go to the 1830's and The Trail of Tears..,They will end up saying it was from the 1921.. its all about the money!!,I would say I’m shocked by some of the comments but I’ve lived in Oklahoma a long time.,I thought they didn’t find remains.,Ralph Duncan III,Digging up caskets is not a mass burial.,Being that it's a cemetery::: how have the groundbreaking crew not found these remains before? I know a lot of my ancestors do not have grave markers::: only burial plot numbers. So are they making sure these unmarked remains aren't some of those from when people couldn't afford them and still can't?,"I do not believe if people were killed in a ""race massacre "" that the people doing the killing would take the time to make coffins just saying damn!!",When both sides are involved in shooting and killing the definition is riot,Hailey Ausmus,Them lady's are correct..,You know what’s amazing? A bunch of white people that NEVER attended OU::: trying to make fallacious statements about the vicious murder of black Tulsans::: by armed white mobs. Y’all are truly disgusting for trying to bury history and the unjust treatment of black Americans in a metaphorical grave. Shut your pie hole and LISTEN::: for a change.,If you're looking for Systemic Racist Bones::: one needs not go any farther than the Academic IndoctraCation Closet?💁🏽‍♂️,All the white people triggered on here that proof of racism in Oklahoma is being found.

The University of Oklahoma announced today the immediate end of its university-wide masking requirement and social distancing policies in accordance with updated CDC guidelines.  Masking will no longer be required on all three of OU’s campuses or at campus events for fully vaccinated individuals 12 years of age and older::: with limited exceptions.  Read more by visiting https://link.ou.edu/3oDYYe8.,2021-05-19 19:42:17,Set all the students free...vaccinat ed or unvaccinated! Stop playing this political BS game!!!!! OK is better than this::: & it’s unlawful to try & mandate. A lawsuit is certainly in the university’s future.,So like as teachers are we required to enforce in a classroom? I can’t ask a student if they’re vaccinated::: but I have to make sure the policy holds for the unvaccinated. I’m not really sure how this will work?,It’s time the university ends masking regardless of whether someone is vaccinated or not.,Isn’t there something called HIPPA laws? How can anyone ask you if you are vaccinated or not,Yes! Finally! Though waaaay overdue (especially outside!!🙄)::: I’m just glad they’re calling off the absolute nonsense. Thank you.,My concern with this is for those who are fully vaccinated and choose to not wear masks::: there is no absolute proof on how long the vaccine is going to last in the body to fight off Covid. My next concern is the unvaccinated folks who by no fault of their own::: can’t get vaccinated because of immunity issues::: this includes staff and students. For those who are unvaccinated and are wearing masks::: are there going to be policies in place to prevent ridicule of these folks? We know how cruel folks can be and we know the mask wearers are going to be discriminated against singled out. I personally think this is foolish decision and unfortunately Falls on the backs of our kids. All of this pretty much boils down to petty political greediness and ignorance and lack of respect for humanity.,What about showing proof,Thank God they got rid of that communist nonsense.,My son will not be vaccinated and will not wear a mask either! ✌️,That deserves a big BOOMER!,Cue the Facebook lawyers in 3..2…1……:,Are u requiring vaccine passports because that’s kind of a big violation of HIPAA? Just saying.,So no more wearing the mask while we huff and puff through the stadium and up/down the ramps!!!,So yesterday not wearing a mask was on par with murder and today it’s cool. What a difference a day makes!!,Asking college students to mask was always silly anyway.,Well::: my son has already enrolled at another school now. ~sad::: OU Alum mom 😩,Fully vaccinated. Leaves out most of the people of Oklahoma.,So what! You need proof verifying you had the vaccination?,Get vaccinated::: kids!!,Wonderful. Texas figured that out 3 months ago.,Gotta be tough to wear a disposable paper mask....,🙌🏻,How will you know if someone is vaccinated or not?,Kyle Meyer,🙌🏽🙌🏽,😬,So are they going to stop everyone they see and ask for a vaccine card? Idiots🤦‍♀️,Thank you Rand Paul!,Thank you::: thank you::: thank you!!!!!,Yes! Thank you Jesus,Wonderful news for the OU faithful Boomer!,Parker Bryant,Jacob,YESSSSSS,McKenzi Pettit here’s our answer,Bout time!!,BOOMER SOONER,this bull 💩 should have ended along time ago,Victor Langholz 👀,Zoe Routh yes ma’am 🤩,Taylor,Thank the sweet baby Jesus! 🇺🇸❤️🇺🇸❤️🇺🇸 Masks are not mandated for our safety-\-\they are mandated to CONTROL US!,It’s against the law to ask if someone is vaccinated or for a university to make these kind of mandates. https:// childrenshealthd efense.org/ defender/ resources-federa l-law-prohibits -mandates-emerg ency-use-covid- vaccines-tests- masks/,🤣😂🤣Simon CDC Says! wear / lose::: your mask🤣😂🤣,Do not make vaccines mandatory!,Of course those against vaccine will lie about having had it,If you’re vaccinated::: why do you care who is masked and who isn’t?  #followthescienc e,https:// nymag.com/ intelligencer/ 2021/05/ study-number-of- kids-hospitaliz ed-for-covid-is -overcounted.ht ml,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OU President Joseph Harroz::: Jr. released a statement following the conviction of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin for the death of George Floyd.  For his full statement::: please visit https://link.ou.edu/3sHwEIg.,2021-04-20 23:13:17,I didn't know that you can accidentally and intentionally kill someone::: but that's what the charges say. #riggedtrial #riggedcourt #notguilty #Appeal,I don’t see what “hope for change” we have when we’re convicting a man for murder when he was doing his job the way he was trained to do it. Did he do his job the wrong way and deserve to be punished? Sure. Convict him of gross negligence or even manslaughter. But murder? There was no intent behind his actions except to restrain a resisting suspect the way he was trained to do. Fire him. Charge him with a crime that gives him some jail time and makes it where he can never work as a cop again. But murder? No. If you want to charge him with murder you better charge every single politician in DC that has commented in favor of this verdict because I assure you::: they have far more evil and murderous intentions than Chauvin did.,Please stop releasing statements like this. It’s embarrassing! Go back to educating our young people..,OU is part of the problem::: not the solutions,This is embarrassing for me that my alma mater is cow towing to the left 😢,I said he got the RIGHT punishment!! But lumping all these cases together that have NO relevance to the other is wrong!!,Rot in hell::: Derrick Chauvin,It’s ridiculous you feel as if you needed to comment on the verdict.,Drugs are bad!,🤎🤎🤎,Please protect my 2 daughters that attend your university. This law is crazy!!https:// www.cnn.com/ 2021/04/22/us/ oklahoma-law-dri vers-protesters /index.html,How DARE you invoke MLK who championed judgment on character::: not color of skin?? But that’s exactly what you’re doing!!,OMFG. Really?? Chauvin got the right punishment. STOP including other cases with this!! Contributing to this nonsense::: nonexistent white racism crap!!,Don't forget to comply,Let’s not forget that Floyd rubbed a woman while holding a gun to her pregnant belly. HERO.. FLOYD LIVES IN LEGACY,Floyd died from an overdose. He was a thug not a hero.,Would you rather have someone 62% of your weight kneel on your neck... or take a 3x lethal dose of fentanyl. Which has a higher likelihood of survival?,Klan members when a cop kills a unarmed minority: shouldn’t resist::: comply etc Klan members when their fellow klan members do what minorities does: 👨‍🦯👨‍🦯👨‍🦯👨‍🦯. Y’all racist people in the comments section y’all are sad and pathetic. Y’all will be the same ones that will sit here and say y’all are Christians. No no y’all aren’t. Floyd died because of the pig not drugs.

Thank you OU for being inclusive and highlighting the diversity that makes us great but also needs to be addressed and corrected.,The world was made for people!!!!!!! No matter their color!!!!!! Just check your Bible if you have one! I am SICK to death of race issues!!! One race exists on this planet::: the HUMAN race::: full of beautifully made people.,Diversity is fine if you seek it :::but should never be shoved down your throat.,What a wonderful opportunity for education and growth!! Especially thankful to this beautiful POC for sharing her story ♥️,These are the Woke Supremacists who degrade the finest country in the world based on Lies. You love hating America::: Hating Capitalisms::: Hating the Flag for which it stands::: One Nation Under God. You Hate Free Speech and love hating your God-Given Freedom. You Hate the Family Unit::: Hate the truth of biological sex::: hate the Creator::: and Love being Victim. Those of you who push racial justice and social justice are delusional and are racist::: and sadly you don't even realize it. Critical Race Theory is a Lie! OU is a disgraced institution for pushing this nonsense. You are a laughing stock institution.,Ok so what about the BLM protesters who held white:::black:::ais ans hostage inside a bank by keeping the doors closed.

In partnership with OU Health::: the University of Oklahoma strives to ensure our OU community is provided with information to make well-informed decisions about COVID-19 vaccinations. Have questions about the vaccine? We will provide answers.,2021-03-03 18:59:09,Does it hurt when the micro chip in the vaccine embeds in your brain?,Information about vaccines in Goddard Health Center can be found here: https:// www.ou.edu/ healthservices/ COVID-101/ COVID-Vaccines,Since every university requires certain vaccines (or documented exemptions) for students::: will this be one of the required ones? I certainly hope so::: especially those students living on campus.,"Do the OU Medical Advisers offer information regarding the Adverse Event Outcomes after taking the Pfizer::: Moderna::: and AstraZeneca's Gene Therapy injections these companies are calling vaccines? Vaccines prevent infectious diseases..... None of the mRNA or DNA Gene Therapy injections were approved by the FDA::: nor do they prevent a person from being infected with SARS-2-CoV19::: which has a 99.6% recovery rate without the injection. So::: again::: my question. ""Have the OU Medical Advisers told their faculty::: staff::: official members::: and the Students that there are numerous serious Adverse Event Outcomes::: including death that are Not Side Effects::: associated with getting these non-vaccine injections?"" Of course not::: so::: here you go everyone; learn what these manipulating Gene Therapy's injections have done to people because none at OU are going to tell you. They've sold their souls to Big Pharma. Stop being a Lab Rat for a Vaccine Company's Experimental Antigen cell creating Toxin they're pushing and selling by the Billions. Below is how you search what is being reported per the CDC's Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) and half of the Adverse Event Outcomes never make it into the VAERS system on purpose. Here is a News Flash OU... If you provide Medical Opinions::: You are Now Liable For Damages... I encourage Any and Every Person who experiences an issue after taking these Gene Therapy Experimental Injections to bring suit against OU and any other College that promotes this BS for extreme damages.

On-campus during a literal global pandemic that has killed millions world-wide and over a half-million in the US alone is good?  Maybe this makes me a bad alumnus::: but this is a TERRIBLE idea and is reinforcing an atmosphere of death. I'm ashamed to be part of OU if this is who they're going to be.  And my niece::: who earned her RN at OU only to become a COVID ICU nurse as her FIRST job? You're telling her that her life is unimportant and doesn't matter::: because ignoring the very real disease that she faces every day while she watches patients die alone is more important than being on campus.  I'm revolted.,Not buying the BS... The truth is::: it had nothing to do with your efforts or a vaccine... The virus has played itself out just like years before with other viral infections. Same thing happened with SARS1::: Swine Flu::: etc::: etc...,YES::: FINALLY!!! I can finish my degree after delaying my education over a year due to all of this!,I'll believe it when it happens.

Do you have questions about the COVID-19 vaccine? Here's your chance to hear from the experts. Today from 12-1:30 p.m.::: you can join the conversation virtually at bit.ly/3juUiVo to receive any answers you may need regarding the vaccination.,2021-02-11 17:16:09,Vaccine has been out what 2/3 months and there are experts on it’s long term effects? B/S,I think many in public are more interested in how to get vaccinated? And when? Supply chain management and a realistic timeline when a vaccine will be available.,Was the webinar recorded? I was unable to attend and would love to share the valuable information provided.,"I have a few questions: 1.) What is your definition of Safe? 2.) What are the limits of mRNA vaccines to travel throughout the lymphatic system into all parts of the body? 3.) Are the mRNA vaccines specific to which healthy cell it causes to grow the SARS2-CoV19 spike protein on the surface of a Healthy Cell turning these Healthy cells into an Antigen cell? 4.) Will the CD4::: CD8::: T cells::: NT::: Nature Killer cells Destroy the Healthy Cells now that these cells are indeed officially Antigen cells in the body? 5.) What is the expected outcome if the Innate and Adaptive Immune Response is compromised and can not destroy the newly created Antigen Cells? 6.) If these Antigen cells start to multiply due to a weak immune response::: will these cells be identified as Cancer cells that continue to trigger constant inflammation in the body? 7.) Should those who choose to take this vaccine do an Immune Panel Test to determine if their innate and adaptive immune responses are at normal range levels to adequately destroy the Antigen Cells to keep these cells from reproducing? 8.) Was the intent of the creators who developed the mRNA vaccines to cause an Adverse Event Outcome to achieve an Autoimmune Response? 9.) If an Adverse Event Outcome was the goal for the mRNA vaccines::: why call any Inflammatory event ""Side Effects?"" I could go on and on asking questions::: wounding what happens if this vaccine enters the brain::: heart::: lungs::: liver::: kidneys::: but I will ask just one more? 10.) You being esteemed doctors::: do you remember in the movie Jurassic Park when Ian Malcolm said::: quote; ""𝐘𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐬𝐜𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐬 𝐰𝐞𝐫𝐞 𝐬𝐨 𝐩𝐫𝐞𝐨𝐜𝐜𝐮𝐩𝐢𝐞𝐝 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐰𝐡𝐞𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐫 𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐲 𝐜𝐨𝐮𝐥𝐝::: 𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐲 𝐝𝐢𝐝𝐧'𝐭 𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐩 𝐭𝐨 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐤 𝐢𝐟 𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐲 𝐬𝐡𝐨𝐮𝐥𝐝.""

President Harroz’s statement on the actions today at our nation’s Capitol.,2021-01-06 23:44:24,In order to have a peaceful transition::: we must have fair and transparent elections. The belief in fair elections is the bedrock of our democracy.,Where were you to speak out agaiant BLM and Antifa,So happy both of my children attend OU!! Please keep fighting on the side of dignity and justice!!,stick to teaching our youths and keep your political views to yourself. I guess BLM and Antifa is fine to run amuck. But when you push Patriots into a corner::: you get the Bull,You teach the importance of civil discourse and free speech at OU? What a joke! I’m becoming more and more embarrassed that I have a degree from there.,"what a joke....didn't see ""OU"" come out against all the lawlessness for the last 8 months...riotin g::: looting::: burning the flag::: attacking gov buildings....Wh ere was ""OU"" preaching civility then? NO WHERE....",Absolutely::: and thank you for allowing our young students to read this and think about it. Everything that happened in this riot instigated by the president was criminal and should be prosecuted.,Where was your statement when the other party was destroying and compromising others well being and sanctity.,Peaceful transition of power is based in the belief that the election was fair and honest::: not fraudulently stolen! Keep your elitist attitude to yourself or we may start pushing the legislature to cut funding!,How convenient to make a statement when it’s a bunch of senators getting scared.  But when folks are rioting in the streets and burning down peoples businesses it’s ok then.... got it.  Cherry pick all day long 🙌🏻,Where was this statement when the destroyed Portland and Seattle. Rule of law appears to be arbitrary depending on the cause. Issuing statements like this is not the job of a University President. You might consider understanding why a lot of people are disillusioned with our institutions instead of virtue signaling.,What threatens our republic is politicians attacking the constitution at every turn not living up to their oath of office.,You mean the embedded A n t i f a? OU continues to disappoint- Panderer,Where were your statements all summer while cities burned and people were being murdered in the streets,Public universities should stay out of politics. Also::: you don’t promote free speech if it goes against any staffers own opinion.,Domestic terrorism. I worked OKC when in army. I'd gladly put my uniform back on to defend our country on this day. BTW. Security very strangely lax today. I used to work in DC also. Sharpshooters on bldgs. Where were they? And if these would have been POC the police would be in riot gear and they'd have been shot before they got to Capitol door. Proud to be a Sooner. Thank you!,"""...antithetica l to who we are as a people""?  Care to look outside your bubble::: oh say -\-\ to cities like Portland::: that have a Mayor (slash::: yes) Police Commissioner who advocates for::: encourages::: and negotiates with Antifa::: who have increasingly demonstrated violent behavior toward people::: property::: and freedoms::: quite similar to ""what we have witnessed today""?  It's this very avoidance of reality that has many citizens rising in resistance.",I’m unsure as to why this statement was even made...? Do people genuinely care what the OU president says about anything other than OU?,Trey White,It’s absolutely amazing how easily people buy into BS. The same people shown storming the capital today are paid crisis actors. The president did not condone this and asked peacefully for people to go home::: yet that video was taken down. People are gullible::: it’s sad. I am completely disgusted by the University that I was once so proud to have graduated from::: this is a joke.,President Harroz::: I hope that if any employees of OU are found to have been involved in this insurrection (and I'd bet there were)::: they are dismissed immediately.,Time to look into your own house. The environment of OU from a conservative’s viewpoint is a beat down. We have been quiet while the liberal professors and administrators push their liberal agendas on our students. You must represent ALL students!,When you stop indoctrinating students and go back to educating them::: then I might consider your statements valid. Until that time::: with all do respect::: Joseph Harroz Jr::: go pound sand up your ass!,Except when it comes to religion and protecting the unborn. The directors of this institution are a joke and will use the Constitution when it pushes their narrative but spit on it when it comes to truth.,Was this same address made during the riots and looting? Burning down if innocent peoples businesses::: killing people etc.,Scanning for your call out of BLM and Antifa too before I comment.,This is what Trump and his sheep wanted. To look tough and try to over throw democracy. They will try and compare this to BLM protests. One protests police brutality::: the other attacked democracy itself. It's disgusting. Look at this picture and tell me you aren't disgusted by it.,Apparently you haven’t watched any news lately. The Democratic Party is far from peaceful.,Universities should stay out of politics,As an OU GRAD::: I'm glad to know your point of view. Thank you.,Not surprised for the Statement ... As one professor pointed out to me::: Higher Learning is aimed to dummify the masses. One of the Bullet Points of Socialism::: is to erode the educational resources. Divided we Fall.,When I had to evacuate DC in June I said that Bowser’s decision to stand by and do nothing would come back to haunt the city.  I’m truly sorry that it happened this quickly::: but I’m so glad God had me leave when He did.,Why was this statement even necessary? As I sat watching my country in turmoil today they very last thing I was thinking about was what the president of OU was thinking about the situation.,I’m proud to be an OU graduate today!,Weird I dont remember this same energy when BLM and Antifa was burning down entire areas of cities 🤔,what happened when the protests this summer wasn't wrong just asking we the people want a truthful election not one that is stolen by fraudulent votes,What happened today was disgraceful::: but you need to make a choice.,Yeah true but not when it was stolen from the American people.,Thank you for taking a stand. The people sitting idly by thinking::: in any fashion this is normal or OK are the problem. Brave people that can lead are needed to get us out of this quagmire and to begin to the heal the wounds and scars of recent times.,I was a bit shocked at first but once I found out antifa and the like infiltrated the event::: it should be ovious that the outcome couldn't be good. Some would say that once Trump is out of the White House the problem is over. No::: the problem will still be there and unfixed until a much better system is in place::: especially in problem states. If they keep using the easily-manipula ted dominion voting machines::: it is proof that they have no interest in fixing the problem. Fortunately for Oklahoma::: we seem to have a pretty good system in place that other states should look into.,Can someone point me to the statement(s) where he condemned the other clowns for burning and looting other cities over the past 4 yrs?,Who asked for his opinion! He wants to seem “woke”,How are you going to run a college and not understand how this country was founded?,I do not think OU Leadership should be lecturing anyone on following laws or rules or morals or ethics. Stop while you are ahead.,You don't care about the rule of law. Millions of unauthorized (unlawful) aliens in the USA. Never saw post about that issue.,Where was the peaceful transition in 2016?,Would like to have seen this statement more over the past four years.,Don’t recall anyone asking for the University’s stance,Did he call put Chaz as well?? I cant remember.,Don’t steal from the American people it will just piss us off as you can see.,Right. And thank you for releasing this statement the last go round as well.,You spelled “free and fair elections are the bedrock of our Republic” Wrong,Maybe he should be the US senator from Oklahoma,What about the riots this summer and fall?,I think the university of Oklahoma was spot on::: I agree with the president’s statement .,This reminds me of his comments after each riot and looting event. Not,The people who stormed in have yet to be identified. Look like antifa. Nice jump to judgement.,"""Before you pray for peace::: pray for the truth to have its day. We have denied truth for far too long in our culture. It’s the truth that sets us free. Nothing good comes from lies::: and certainly not peace."" - Steve Deace",sure they are and the the deep state is to blame. they most likely even hired antifi to act like republicans and cause trouble. they have paid their way into the whitehouse and lied and cheated all the way.,"Where were these statements when Antifa and BLM were looting::: assaulting Trump supporters::: committing arson::: burning down police precincts::: destroying the lives of innocent people::: damaging businesses and cars??? Not one word- by the way::: I do not condone violence at all::: but there has been a clear double standard of justice in this country- if you are a Republican::: you are dealt with; if you are a Democrat::: NOTHING HAPPENS TO YOU (FBI spies on Trump's campaign::: all the illegal activities happening). People are sick and tired of it. I will use the phrase that Dem's always use- there was only a few bad people and they were mostly peaceful....exc ept::: this time::: it was. ANTIFA::: AND BLM::: had people in the ranks doing damage::: NOT ALL TRUMP SUPPORTERS. Case in point in these pics. The ""viking"" was wearing the same outfit at a BLM (love fest) assaulting innocent people in Arizona. The other people beside him are also ANTIFA....you WILL NOT hear this from the fake-ass news media::: like CNN AND MSNBC::: where a CNN reporter::: during the riots in Minnesota::: said the rally was mostly peaceful::: while directly behind him::: buildings were literally on fire and people were looting businesses (I guess sneakers::: clothing::: and jewelry were important to the BLM peeps).....thes e groups are TERRORIST in nature. I an a die-hard OU fan::: but NOT A FAN of the ""elites"" who clearly kiss ass. It takes a lot of guts to send the statement from the university (sarcasm).",Didn't see you make this statement when cities were being destroyed::: private businesses looted and burned and people being threatened! Hopefully you believe that was lawless and destructive and will also put out a statement about that!,Big shocker ou comes out on the side of democrats didn't see that 1 coming. These universities are just part of the brainwashing Democrat system.,Is there a reason why we need this statement?,Our government is lawless and there has been no justice served. The FBI is in on the crime too. Our media and social media is in on it. Until we implement some justice::: the people will rise up.,Basic education on the federal government system. Thank you for the statement to educate the people of Oklahoma and the nation.  What was supposed to happen:  “the President of the Senate shall::: in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives ::: open all the certificates and the votes shall then be counted; -\-\ The person having the greatest number of votes for President::: shall be the President::: if such number be a majority of the whole number of Electors appointed”. - applicable part of Amendment XII::: U.S. Constitution  What happened:  Disregard and disrespect for the Constitution by a radical minority.,I couldn’t agree more. Universities teaching kids to hate America is part of the reason this country is in the trouble it’s in now.,President Harroz as an alumnus and 32 year Army veteran this is domestic terrorism.,The DemoRats have been lawless since they lost!!! Then they have to buy & steal this election. Now we should just go peacefully::: the nerve of crazy people!!,Wow but no consideration for the fact that a political coup took over our country! Sit back in your cushy academic world and point fingers!!,The “peaceful” protests in July in DC.... media silence!,Since an Oklahoma House rep (Mullin) was front and center physically and was one of the objectors the University had to distance itself from being possibly associated with his foolishness.,Sad::: you are only worried about your tax exempt status. Don't get involved in politics and focus on your students,No::: the bedrock of our democracy is a free and FAIR election. The whole transition has not been peaceful because people believe the election was fraudulent. This whole fiasco could have been avoided if the courts had agreed to simply look at the evidence. The fact that the cases were thrown out before anyone even looked is suspicious::: then you have all the shady dealings with ballots being destroyed makes people all that much more concerned that they are being conned.,You might want to see what you can do about the OU alum/ embarrassment that is Cleta Mitchell. She played a major role in what happened today.,Who in the hell cares what Dean Harroz has to say about events in DC?,It was Antifa!,You should not be making “political” statements. You give the appearance of being biased.,Trump never received a peaceful transfer. They tried to drag him through hell. They havnt figured out that’s when he’s at his best.,University is making a statement::: that is all...,Where was this kind of condemnation at the riots this summer? Or during Obama’s tenure (Ferguson::: Baltimore::: etc. )?,Who cares what he thinks? Why would I care what the president of a university thinks? Legit question... why is this notable?,"""But when a long train of abuses and usurpations::: pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism::: it is their right::: it is their duty::: to throw off such Government::: and provide new Guards for their future security."" https:// www.cga.ct.gov/ asp/content/ constitutions/ Declaration.htm# :~:text=But%20w hen%20a%20long% 20train:::guards% 20for%20their%2 0future%20secur ity.",Did you condemn the riots and looting this summer? Guess I missed it.,I don’t remember a comment when our cities were being burned down!,When you start showing proof or fraud someone might listen to you. Until then shut up.,When the evidence points to voter fraud and a fair election was not upheld::: and voting doesn’t even matter anymore::: then what is the next step?? I mean::: we can wait 2 more year and vote again but do we trust even voting anymore??? What does that leave???,Yeah::: and where was this talk when Trump was elected. They attacked him NON-STOP::: trying to impeach him. I am not for violence::: but enough is enough!,Wow::: I can't believe this isn't from The Onion or something. Amazing how silent all these people have been this last year with all their concern about lawlessness and destruction. Where the hell have you all been?,No one talks about all of the looters and rioters in our major cities????,How disgusting that you haven’t called out the left on them quite literally burning cities down. To act self righteous now is outrageous .,It's what they do!👀,That’s how rational people think. I hope what happened today is just a passing cloud.,Why make any statement? Why is it important to toot a horn right now?,What about the blatant planned infiltration of Antifa into the Trump crowd today. Huh? Been planned for weeks. Dress like the right and talk like the right. Well here ya go::: this is why. To do stuff like this and now it looks like it's Trumps fault and his supporters. NEVER in the history of supporting Trump have the Republicans shown any acts of violence or destruction::: even in massively large groups. This is 100% not in line with our behavior.,He’s forgetting the Antifa riots this summer and DC!,Where was you wisdom hiring riots and burning down building for the past 4 yrs. A theif is a thief. Illegal is illegal. There is no justification for out right fraud toward the American people. You are as bad as the corrupt politician's,OU is becoming just another bastion of liberalism. It’s sad and shameful!,Is Ronnie Perkins coming back or not?,OH::: now standing our ground threatens our republic::: but it did not all summer when Antifa and BLM killed people and burned cities to the ground! Maybe you Mr. Joseph Harroz::: Jr. should have chose to keep your thoughts to yourself!,While I'm an OU fan why does he feel the need to make a statement? What does this have to do with OU?,Why is he making a statement?,Please make a comment about Antifa and BLM...,Sorry but what the president of any university has to say really doesn’t matter. Why is this even necessary?,And these were NOT Trump supporters but Antifa!!!!! So get your story straight people on this post as well!!!,University has no business getting involved in politics,so is fraud and rigged elections just because the president isn't a poltian but a business man and know's more than any dumbass politican::: all they care about is money,Stop getting involved in politics and do your job.,OU::: where were you as our Nation was being burned::: looted::: and assaulted by ANTIFA and BLM?,Bullshit from ou better get ur lawyers to do a rewrite on ur disclaimer,Where was this damn message over the last 10 months...,It was Antifa that entered the capital building btw.,Has OU turned blue? I feel like it leans that way more and more.,Tired of anyone saying “Democratic Republic” or “Democracy” Dammit we are a “Constitutional Republic”!!,So you think this was a fair election ehh?,"Just like during the ""peaceful protest""... Riots.. 😂",Wow::: I’ve backed this school my entire life. Who knew what a bunch of unpatriotic flakes you are. It’s NOT unpatriotic to DEMAND a fair election. They disgraced our president for 4 years without merit::: and now have stolen the election. Let me guess? No evidence::: right? You are all blind sheep following blindly to the slaughter. You keep right on trucking::: as for the 75 MILLION of us that voted for our president::: we will continue to pursue justice!! Sad day in the OU nation. Adios::: sheep.,Thank you President Harroz for your leadership and example. Class of 2001,Joseph Harroz Jr is all wet. When only one side has to follow the law while the other obeys NO LAWS....we are a tyranny not a Republic::: Not a Democracy::: it's all gone if we let this massive election theft stand.,More universities need to teach more young people about American constitution and American history. Amen!,I would comment about what Pelosi did today but you might think what she does is appropriate. Did you see her with the gangster musicians who have been putting poor young black males in prisons?,Thank you for speaking up,What was disgraceful is allowing the democrats to steal the entirety of the government through MASSIVE fraud.,Thank you for that statement! Proud to be a Sooner ❤️,Could care less what this guy has to say.,What about a FAIR ELECTION WITHOUT FRAUD!!,Tommy Keen,And the fraudulent election and votes are condoned?! You just lost my support! Go Pokes!,Proud to be an OU alumni,It is no surprise this anti American rhetoric is coming from Norman Only one of 4 places in Oklahoma that lean left Norman::: Stillwater::: Tulsa::: Oklahoma City. All 4 have the same thing in common with the record low 17% of all counties nationwide that allegedly voted for Pedo Joe  They all have a large percent of the population that depends on state and federal handouts and subsidies to support their lifestyle  While the majority of the other 83% of counties nationwide work for private companies for their livelyhood Liberals overwhelmingly depend on welfare::: live in government housing::: ride government transportation::: or are employed by state and::: federal governments or are employed by universities that are subsidized by state and federal tax dollars,Milquetoast statement from ou.,Thank you for making this statement. I am proud the leader of the university stands up for what is right. Trump is poison::: and those who convince themselves the election is stolen are simply refusing to accept the reality. The people have spoken::: just accept it with grace and respect.,Was this the same sentiment and speech given when blm was rioting and looting?,Thank you for posting! This makes me more proud that my daughter graduated from OU.,Thanks for having the courage to post this... especially in a state where the majority doesn’t want to hear it 😢,why does he refer to America as a democracy? we arent....,Thank you for speaking up!,C'mon joe.you should be able to figure out what was going on!,Shut up and stay out of it run the University,Yeah right!,Freedom as we...not you...know it is done.,John Sullivan and his Antifa was there,Did someone ask you?,I’m here for the “no longer a Sooner” comments,President Harroz you are such a hypocrite. Where were your statements condemning the riots and destruction and civil discourse this past summer from Antifa and BLM?,Stealing an election is the definition of lawless and destructive,Increíble to read statement from places were the future generations are being taught::: supporting the destruction of our democracy. It would’ve better to just STAY QUITE. This was the most disgusting act of fraud the United States of America has been exposed to. No words. Not only did we lose our rights today and effectively become a socialist country::: but We will not even recognize our country in four years. We are entering very scary times::: and is sick to see a statement coming from an University that support all of this chaos,Wasn't this the same school that had a sex scandal recently.,I wonder how many people said that after Lexington,"So when you decided to have a one way message against POTUS and not against the real Hate groups like Antifa and BLM that threatened lives like the elderly and young mother's being punched out because she was Caucasian just shows who speaks with a forked tongue at OU. It's sad to say OU is following in the sMe footsteps as Harvard in becoming a Socialst Re-education brain washing camp. I am sure as the sky is blue::: OU would want Civil War sites and Graves plowed under nothing like following in the footsteps of real Monster's Like Pol Pot::: Hitler and the Taliban in removing History instead of ""learning"" from it and not repeating it.",Didn’t antifa and BLM attack::: burn and vandalize a STATE CAPITAL in a so called peaceful protest this past year?,OU is showing it's prejudice::: not a word from them when blm burns::: loots and kills or antifa is beating up Trump supporters,Charlie Chimney,Dude::: are you a special kind of stupid?,Comments from a lists of fool’s justifying this criminal act.,What’s your take on cheating Joseph? If a student were suspected of cheating you would investigate::: determine the scale::: and penalize... maybe even expel depending on the circumstances. Imagine looking at evidence of cheating and being told what you saw was bs and to go file some paperwork or type on a computer and shut your mouth about it. Imagine your mindset over a simple case of cheating. Now magnify it by 1000. This isn’t a cheating student on a test::: this is the election of our democracy where 74 million people saw the cheating and are being told to sit down and shut up. That’s not democracy. The cheating threatens our democracy::: not the actions of those not willing to sit down::: take what they get::: and pretend it did not happen.,Tammie Barker Moore,Charlie St. Germaine,Zella Steward Root,Christopher Smith,Richard Shay,Denisa Eaton,Shane Lee,Shane Lee,Matt Smith,Eric Smiley,Brad Cook,Where was all this talk about peaceful transitions during the riots because Trump became president? Shouldn’t the peaceful transition have started four years ago instead of just now?,All of you trump cultists in this comment section decreased my brain cells by half. Most of y’all aren’t even OU students::: keep your comments in your empty caverns where your brain should be and go back to licking boots or whatever,People are actually defending these fools,Did you script the same message during the burning and looting? I can’t find it??,"Wasnt the Wisconsin state capital ""breeched"" when Scott Walker was governor? Was the left outraged? I think not. So breeching is not a problem for them except to try to use it against conservatives.",it was antifa today maybe deep state too. but transfers of power arent normally based on cheating.,Sadly so many that have called for peace now have stood by while our country has had riots::: looting and burning. We have people that have attacked others for their differences in opinions or because of whom they voted for. We have watched while people say that your only entitled to free speech if it agrees with them. For 4 years one side has done everything to embarrass this country. We have one side screaming F America::: death to America::: burning flags yet now that same side is saying we need unity. Ya know calling for unity after people have stated repeatedly that Trump supporters need to be marked so everyone can know whom they are and punish them properly isnt a call for unity. Nor is saying Trump supporters need to be put in a deprogramming camp and deprogrammed. Telling Trump supporters they arent welcome anywhere isnt a call for unity. For 4 years you cant spew hatred then expect friendship. You started the hate now deal with the consequences of your action. But for some reason some people arent really good at accepting the consequences of their own actions. We have politicians that stood by and did nothing and said nothing to promote peace and unity for 4 years instead they encouraged hatred. You cant demand unity and peace when you smirked and told people to burn it down. Nor do you have the right to counsel people or how they should act when they are just as angry. What is good for goose is good for the gander right?? So sit back enjoy your presidency cause its gonna get turned up really hot for ya.,Why wasn’t there a statement released every time antifa rioted??? Why not when blm/antifa attacked government buildings and law enforcement officers???,Norman is the San Francisco of Oklahoma,Too bad you didn’t issue a statement last summer.,Here is one of the individuals from the Capital who also is an ANTIFA member::: just like the 2 directly next to him. Don't be fooled::: people- quite a few of the bad apples were ANTIFA blending in with the crowd. The fake-ass news::: like CNN AND MSNBC::: are trying to lump all this on Trump supporters..... people are sick and tired of this double standard.,You suck big! Election was stolen! All Democrats suck and most Republicans::: too.,Case in point why people need an education :::you don’t learn that in High school .it’s just true,Never saw you stand up when BLM and Antifa were out looting and burning or for 4 years the Democraps tried to impeach President Trump for As they say being a Russian agent. Typical Democraps,Just pretend it's innocent business owners being murdered and having their lives ruined by BLM/antifa terrorists and you won't care anymore.,And you kept your mouth shut while the Democrats have done what they've done really you're a total jackass,"They are trai·tor to this country trai·tor a person who betrays a country::: principle::: etc. ""they see me as a traitor::: a sellout",We have NO Faith in ANYONE in dc Except President Trump!!! This PATHETIC president of ou has Not said a word until now::: So as far as I'm concerned he can Shut The Crap Up because his opinion is MEANINGLESS & CLUELESS!!!  joseph harroz jr = CLASSLESS MORON!,Where was this douchebag when blm and antifa were destroying the country??? Had nothing to say then huh? Suck it Joseph Harroz.,John Sullivan and his Antifa was there. It was them!!!!,Keep raising your tuition and stfu,Who cares what you say? I don’t.,“When the looting stars::: the shooting stars.” George Wallace::: 1968  “When the looting stars::: the shooting stars.” Donald Trump::: 2020,Shut up,Called politicians,Boomer Sooner Love my School!!,This is BS.,Very well said!,Well said my friend.,ok,https:// redstate.com/ sister-toldjah/ 2021/01/06/ some-questions-t hat-need-to-be- asked-and-thing s-that-need-to- be-said-about-t odays-chaos-in- d-c-n305634,Spot on,Joe::: you are an idiot,Did you speak out against Antifa and BLM's violence::: rioting::: looting::: and arson?

Those elections::: in turn::: must comply with the Constitution and with federal and state law. When the voters fairly decide an election::: pursuant to the rule of law::: the losing candidate should acknowledge and respect the legitimacy of that election. And::: if the voters choose to elect a new office-holder::: our Nation should have a peaceful transfer of power. The election of 2020::: like the election of 2016::: was hard fought and::: in many swing states::: narrowly decided. The 2020 election::: however::: featured unprecedented allegations of voter fraud::: violations and lax enforcement of election law::: and other voting irregularities. Voter fraud has posed a persistent challenge in our elections::: although its breadth and scope are disputed. By any measure::: the allegations of fraud and irregularities in the 2020 election exceed any in our lifetimes. And those allegations are not believed just by one individual candidate. Instead::: they are widespread. Reuters/Ipsos polling::: tragically::: shows that 39% of Americans believe ‘the election was rigged.' That belief is held by Republicans (67%)::: Democrats (17%)::: and Independents (31%). Some Members of Congress disagree with that assessment::: as do many members of the media. But::: whether or not our elected officials or journalists believe it::: that deep distrust of our democratic processes will not magically disappear. It should concern us all. And it poses an ongoing threat to the legitimacy of any subsequent administrations . Ideally::: the courts would have heard evidence and resolved these claims of serious election fraud. Twice::: the Supreme Court had the opportunity to do so; twice::: the Court declined. On January 6::: it is incumbent on Congress to vote on whether to certify the 2020 election results. That vote is the lone constitutional power remaining to consider and force resolution of the multiple allegations of serious voter fraud. At that quadrennial joint session::: there is long precedent of Democratic Members of Congress raising objections to presidential election results::: as they did in 1969::: 2001::: 2005::: and 2017. And::: in both 1969 and 2005::: a Democratic Senator joined with a Democratic House Member in forcing votes in both houses on whether to accept the presidential electors being challenged. The most direct precedent on this question arose in 1877::: following serious allegations of fraud and illegal conduct in the Hayes-Tilden presidential race. Specifically::: the elections in three states-Florida::: Louisiana::: and South Carolina-were alleged to have been conducted illegally. In 1877::: Congress did not ignore those allegations::: nor did the media simply dismiss those raising them as radicals trying to undermine democracy. Instead::: Congress appointed an Electoral Commission-cons isting of five Senators::: five House Members::: and five Supreme Court Justices-to consider and resolve the disputed returns. We should follow that precedent. To wit::: Congress should immediately appoint an Electoral Commission::: with full investigatory and fact-finding authority::: to conduct an emergency 10-day audit of the election returns in the disputed states. Once completed::: individual states would evaluate the Commission's findings and could convene a special legislative session to certify a change in their vote::: if needed. Accordingly::: we intend to vote on January 6 to reject the electors from disputed states as not ‘regularly given' and ‘lawfully certified' (the statutory requisite)::: unless and until that emergency 10-day audit is completed. We are not naïve. We fully expect most if not all Democrats::: and perhaps more than a few Republicans::: to vote otherwise. But support of election integrity should not be a partisan issue. A fair and credible audit-conducted expeditiously and completed well before January 20-would dramatically improve Americans' faith in our electoral process and would significantly enhance the legitimacy of whoever becomes our next President. We owe that to the People. These are matters worthy of the Congress::: and entrusted to us to defend. We do not take this action lightly. We are acting not to thwart the democratic process::: but rather to protect it. And every one of us should act together to ensure that the election was lawfully conducted under the Constitution and to do everything we can to restore faith in our Democracy.,Destany Terronez,AnTifa,Thank you!,Hypocrite,James Leonard,BOOMER SOONER.,Short term memory,What a dumbass.,🙄,Keep pandering to the BLM BS....,Thank you.,Who cares?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They are still trying to survive the storm. There is no reason to expect students to come to Norman while their home life may be in shambles. Don’t forget our commuting students that live all over the state. Why make their life anymore complicated?  Safety first. We are in the middle of a pandemic and don’t allow large groups to gather. Plus OU Norman campus is full of very large trees with potential dropping branches.  Come on OU::: we can do better. Where is our compassion?,Hard for students to do online classes without electricity and WiFi,I loved OU coming here because you guys preached family and care for your students.

"""No matter the outcome of the election::: I can assure you this: OU will remain a place of true belonging for all of its community members::: no matter who they are::: or who they voted for."" Read President Harroz's full statement on Election Day below.  OU.EDU A Message from President Harroz - Election Day",2020-10-28 21:51:32,It’s very telling that he even addresses the subject!,OU administration has become liberal idiots.,Been a Sooners fan my entire life but you picked the wrong side::::::::::::::: people who attack everything great about America are not the people to support:::::::::::::::::: stupid,I love the sooners. But no donations from me.,Loving all the negativity on this thread::: as if OU’s statement affects any of you at all. The university is literally just trying to reassure its students that the campus is a place of inclusion regardless of political affiliation. This was the environment when I went to school there::: and if I was still enrolled there I would definitely appreciate the president of the school coming out and reminding the students to keep it classy come election day. The reason that he felt the need to make that statement during this election is because The current president has on more than one occasion gotten his base riled up in a way that makes it dangerous for people that think differently than them. OU is a very diverse campus::: this was clearly a message of inclusion for those feeling uneasy during the current political climate. If president harroz doing that bothers you so much then maybe stop following the universities face book page::: nobody is making any of you read this stuff.,I’m embarrassed to have attended OU ‘Class of 1978’,In other words::: safe spaces and crayons are on standby. 🤣,Brainwashing university,People are turning off football.,Sorry OU Not feeling your inclusiveness as it really isn’t all that inclusive towards students like me. I would love to teach at the collegiate level and know that my viewpoints would be kicked out.,Total lie. If you are a conservative at OU you are forced to hide it.,“A place of true belonging”  *invites someone literally known for hate speech to campus*,Norman is blue... 🤔,I doubt that highly.conserva tives have told media who come to their campuses they are scared to admit political beliefs on campus.also I've seen young people go to different universities(an d the people) that are conservative and they get cussed out and attacked physically by liberals.,You're a money grubben fake!!!,Steven Smithee,Goddamn rednecks... move your asses to Stillwater... or better yet Alabama,This is ridiculous. Did they make this statement in 2012? Or 2016 when they thought Hillary would win? No. They didn't.,Why does a university even need to make this statement ??,I’m about sick of the libtard colleges brainwashing students !,OU is “woke”,Only ones they will protect are the liberals and they will silence the conservatives,Right::: we all belong::: but ones get to propagate their activist BS::: and the others get to eat it.,The University of Oklahoma I am glad that the President of our biggest university in the state took the time to say something about safety and comfort for college students going to this university. I am thankful that President Harroz has continued the opportunity of higher education even with the COVID-19 global pandemic still around::: for those who attend and will attend. Go Joe Biden 2020!,Since when does the outcome of a presidential election require universities to become a place where community members no longer belong? Good job at helping to create a division that isn’t there. 🙄,Dont forget your support for terrorist racist blm u put on your jerseys...  Lost several life time supporters. Along wt booster.  Hope u loose as much as the nfl n round ball,🇺🇲🟥,Brett McQuigg,Thats a lie. Him having to even put out this statement says enough.,The fact that he is having to make this statement shows just how sad the situation has become on college campuses. And I blame the regents for tolerating it.,For all those who talk about being inclusive all the time - if you exclude someone because they don’t think like you then you are by definition not inclusive.,Unless you are a conservative and you will be burned at the stake.,Nicholas Disla,😂😂🤣 blah,No::: the University of Oklahoma will only remain a place of true belonging for Greek Life members and for those whose parents are rich enough to donate to the school.,This is a plea to not vandalize and destroy the campus during the anticipated marches and protests if Trump gets re-elected.,That’s a bunch of bull,Thank you for your message. NOW THE CHALLENGE IS TO LIVE IT. Live by what you say and write and not make it empty rhetoric.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The University of Oklahoma will utilize a test-optional admissions process for the next five years::: making OU the first public university in the state to adopt a multi-year test-optional undergraduate admissions policy.  OU.EDU OU to Adopt Test-Optional Admissions Policy for the Next Five Years,2020-09-23 14:35:05,We're in pretty good company. Some test-optional schools:  Bates College Bowdoin College Bryn Mawr College The George Washington University Hofstra NYU Pitzer College Sarah Lawrence College Smith College (for US citizens/ permanent residents) University of Chicago Wake Forest University Wesleyan University,What,Heard the standards they are going to use...rigorous high school courses::: extra-curricula r activities::: and the essay. Sounds like this is a good way to go. I did tests well...but my son has dyslexia and doesn't. But he is a hard worker so made good grades in a tough school system. That work ethic ought to count...both in college and in life!,Khloe Morris Kennedy Morris,I am so happy to see this. This is a very good thing for people like my son (a transfer student from OCCC after earning his associates degree) who is now a senior at OU and doing well academically. He did not take the ACT because his disabilities made it impossible for him to sit for a lengthy test like the ACT. He could::: however::: do very well on placement tests and he had already passed four college level (CLEP) tests while homeschooling high school. I thought the Americans with Disabilities Act would help students with disabilities by allowing alternate methods of testing college readiness::: but the college board of regents would not allow an exception for him to attend college. It did not matter that he had already earned 12 college credit hours through CLEP. It was not enough proof of being college ready. OCCC would not allow him to attend college without having taken the ACT until a state senator::: Lonnie Paxton::: helped my son.,As an African student::: how can I apply for a fully-fund scholarship? Please,Because setting standards is racist,Tyler Steele,OU’s 2019 acceptance rate was 78%. They let everyone in anyway.,Heba Shanwar,How does this affect merit aid? I’m assuming test scores will still be used for scholarships::: just not admission.,Christie Hendrix Barnett Gracie Barnett,As someone who is not a native English speaker and therefore did not do that well in those test::: but excelled in my Engineering studies and career::: I applaud this move. I hope this also applies to the scholarship selection.,I took the ACT yrs ago. I was sick that day & did poorly. I also have always been super shy in a crowd of strangers. And you could have heard a pin drop that day with about 100 students in the classroom. Luckily::: my dad knew the President of the university & he demanded that I be admitted in the college. When I got my grades that semester::: I took them to the President. I had an A- average over all. The ACT does NOT prove a person’s capability !! It should have been done away with yrs ago !!,Thats cool::: just scoring well its all young people have to offer.,Way back when::: i had already been accepted by OU based on grades from high school. We stopped in Norman on way back from Japan. I took the ACT. My understanding was it was more if a placement test. If remedial classes were needed::: I would have been enrolled in them. I did not need any of those.have no idea how they are used today. This was 1963.,And just like that::: the quality of education at OU dropped significantly.,Be bold ::: eliminate all testing at OU classes. Why not?,Chance Walton,Jaylen Bearpaw,Enrollment is at all time low and no football to bring in the $$$$. That’s what it is all about - welcome to Covid!!,Fantastic!,I don’t understand how they are going to gage and narrow down students and scholarships without national standardized tests comparing apples to apples- not all high schools are created equal.,This is sheer insanity. It is all about getting more unready students to OU to take the zero level remedial courses. It will hurt both OU and the junior colleges. But it really is all about the money.,Paige Crawford Mark Crawford,GPA is significantly more predictive of collegiate success than test scores::: which really only measures the ability to take a specific type of test that is not that commonly used in college anyway. Standardized testing has been a huge part of the dumbing down of America.,Responsorial Psalm PS 119:29::: 72::: 89::: 101::: 104::: 163  R. (105) Your word::: O Lord::: is a lamp for my feet. Remove from me the way of falsehood::: and favor me with your law. R. Your word::: O Lord::: is a lamp for my feet. The law of your mouth is to me more precious than thousands of gold and silver pieces. R. Your word::: O Lord::: is a lamp for my feet. Your word::: O LORD::: endures forever; it is firm as the heavens. R. Your word::: O Lord::: is a lamp for my feet. From every evil way I withhold my feet::: that I may keep your words. R. Your word::: O Lord::: is a lamp for my feet. Through your precepts I gain discernment; therefore I hate every false way. R. Your word::: O Lord::: is a lamp for my feet. Falsehood I hate and abhor; your law I love. R. Your word::: O Lord::: is a lamp for my feet.,Translation::: we need more students regardless of whether we think they can succeed or not. More students = more fees,Act going to lose a lot of money..,Could you lower the bar any more?,Kayla Thornton,🚨 New NCAA Trash Talk Group🚨 Need representation for all teams! Don’t get in your feelings! Not for the faint of heart! https:// www.facebook.com /groups/ 836373493773723/ ?ref=share,Miss you OU,"I'm curious if those who comment negatively actually clicked on the link and read the article? They will not just be looking at GPA::: and holistic approaches have been used at other colleges in the past with great success. Standardized tests are definitely only one indicator of ""college readiness"" and not always a very reliable one. If you take time to read the article::: these test scores will still be considered but are not required - which I think is fantastic. All universities should be looking at the whole student and the sum of what they have accomplished - not just numbers from a test - a test that you can essentially pay to cram for and take an unlimited number of times if you have enough money. This test-optional policy is a step forward and I applaud it.",If you need any help in your assignments please inbox,Huh?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Join us this Thursday for a livestreamed curators’ talk about The University of Oklahoma Libraries upcoming exhibit::: From Tragedy to Triumph: Race Massacre Survivor Stories. This is the inaugural event of OU’s commemoration of the centennial of the Tulsa Race Massacre.  THU::: SEP 24::: 2020 Remembering the Tulsa Race Massacre,2020-09-22 16:59:19,Destin Sampson,Wouldn’t it have made sense to do this in a month in which the massacre took place? The massacre didn’t happen in September it was May 31st and June 1st.,There are people being massacred in Tulsa? I haven't watched the news in a few days::: can't wait to get home and see what's going on...prayers!!🙌,Say it LOUD!,Reading 1 PRV 21:1-6::: 10-13  Like a stream is the king’s heart in the hand of the LORD; wherever it pleases him::: he directs it. All the ways of a man may be right in his own eyes::: but it is the LORD who proves hearts. To do what is right and just is more acceptable to the LORD than sacrifice. Haughty eyes and a proud heart– the tillage of the wicked is sin. The plans of the diligent are sure of profit::: but all rash haste leads certainly to poverty. Whoever makes a fortune by a lying tongue is chasing a bubble over deadly snares. The soul of the wicked man desires evil; his neighbor finds no pity in his eyes. When the arrogant man is punished::: the simple are the wiser; when the wise man is instructed::: he gains knowledge. The just man appraises the house of the wicked: there is one who brings down the wicked to ruin. He who shuts his ear to the cry of the poor will himself also call and not be heard.,#TRUMP4BLACKS202 0,think of it like nursing home hear say -\-\ one person told another person that got other people worked up about something they did not see yet they documented what they did not see at all When you get to a university level::: be responsible for your own actions. stop going backwards 100 years ago when many people did not even complete high school,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The way to end racism is to end racism. Replacing it with an acceptable form of racism doesn't work::: at least logically. Those who are offended by having to look at white faces should either check their own racism at the University gate or move to a country where white faces are nearly non-existent.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It's time to shine in class!,It’s so sad the material of that cloth is causing so much drama over humanity and what’s truly important and that’s just peace to live the way each of us chooses to without it always having to offend anyone. We are all walks of life with different views. Last time I checked I don’t have to go through your yard to get to heaven,💔 🙏,U can prove it by standing for the anthem. For the men and women who layer down their lifes::: so that u may have the right to dishonor out troops and kneel.,May you boys grow up to be like him!,This year::: due to the pandemic::: the flag will only have seven stripes and will only be as big as a bed sheet. The Pride will do the half-time show from Parrington Oval. with no audience::: and all the brass instruments will necessarily have medical grade screens covering the bells.,They will honor these people but not the ones killed by blm terrorist group.. They support the terrorists with patches...  Blm had killed more people than the boston marathon bomber.,I think you have ALREADY FORGOTTEN,I hope no one forgets the 160:::000 and counting covid 19 victims many of which would probably be alive today had we responded correctly,We remember,Then why are the University Of Oklahoma supporting a Marxist socialist group like BLM/ Antifa? If these football players kneel for our flag OU will see a huge financial impact.,It is home of the brave. Home of the brave. Home of the brave!,Hopefully the team will honor lives lost to give us freedoms this Saturday.

RIP,It’s ironic that you choose to honor the lives lost by dishonoring our national flag.,And yet you have no problem with your players disrespecting that flag.,“Freedom is Not Free.”,No one was kneeling then........... ....WE SHOULD NEVER FORGET!!!!,then do not take a knee in public or support home terrorist on uniforms,Not just for 1 day BUT for every day.

Can anyone say ""Play it down!""",Let’s see how many Patriots we see on on the field Saturday night.

For every tree is known by its own fruit. For people do not pick figs from thornbushes::: nor do they gather grapes from brambles. A good person out of the store of goodness in his heart produces good::: but an evil person out of a store of evil produces evil; for from the fullness of the heart the mouth speaks. “Why do you call me::: ‘Lord::: Lord:::’ but not do what I command? I will show you what someone is like who comes to me::: listens to my words::: and acts on them. That one is like a man building a house::: who dug deeply and laid the foundation on rock; when the flood came::: the river burst against that house but could not shake it because it had been well built. But the one who listens and does not act is like a person who built a house on the ground without a foundation. When the river burst against it::: it collapsed at once and was completely destroyed.”,Jesus Teaches on how to Build a House  I will show you what someone is like who comes to me::: listens to my words::: and acts on them. That one is like a man building a house::: who dug deeply and laid the foundation on rock; when the flood came::: the river burst against that house but could not shake it because it had been well built. But the one who listens and does not act is like a person who built a house on the ground without a foundation. When the river burst against it::: it collapsed at once and was completely destroyed.”  Luke 6:47-49,Stop disrespecting that flag by Kneeling then.......,Yes,Zac Thomas,Never forget that 19 muslims under the guidance of another muslim::: committed those horrible acts.,Kneeling or no?,Well let’s see if you remember this tomorrow!!,We're politicizing remembrance of one of the worst national tragedies in world history. Disgusting,I will never forget watching the second plane hit. I was in the Delt house getting my boyfriend for class. I will never forget how empty the sky was that day. The world was literally never the same. We stood together. And now I read these comments. And my heart breaks all over again.

It’s a waste of the time and money and the results are not accurate.  I have fact checked this post with a very reliable source but I still recommend you read the entire article for yourself.  In sum::: the PCR test (nasal swab)is not an accurate test for Covid 19. I posted a prior article several weeks ago stating this and here is another one from The NY Times of all places. Basically the sensitivity of the PCR test is based on a number of cycles and research is showing that if nothing is detected by 24 cycles::: it is highly unlikely the person was infected. There was not enough (or any at all) of the DNA in the sample to indicate infection.  There is no actual FDA guideline for this test. Which is why the sensitivity rate/number of cycles can be manipulated. For example Massachusetts uses 30 cycles while Texas uses 36-37. Other states use 40 cycles.  In order to inflate the ""positive infection"" numbers::: the CDC recommends repeating the procedure up to 40 times to increase the possibility of detecting the DNA.  The PCR test is not a virus diagnostic test.  The CDC set the cycle level to 40 to increase the possibility of finding the sample to be ""infected.""  If the sample has to be amplified more than 24 times::: the probability of the original sample actually being ""infected"" approaches zero.  So what can we learn from this?

No matter your personal views this is valuable knowledge from which we can all learn.  “Chickenpox is a virus. Lots of people have had it::: and probably don't think about it much once the initial illness has passed. But it stays in your body and lives there forever::: and maybe when you're older::: you have debilitatingly painful outbreaks of shingles. You don't just get over this virus in a few weeks::: never to have another health effect. We know this because it's been around for years::: and has been studied medically for years. ""Herpes is also a virus. And once someone has it::: it stays in your body and lives there forever::: and anytime they get a little run down or stressed-out they're going to have an outbreak. Maybe every time you have a big event coming up (school pictures::: job interview::: big date) you're going to get a cold sore. For the rest of your life. You don't just get over it in a few weeks. We know this because it's been around for years::: and been studied medically for years. ""HIV is a virus. It attacks the immune system and makes the carrier far more vulnerable to other illnesses. It has a list of symptoms and negative health impacts that goes on and on. It was decades before viable treatments were developed that allowed people to live with a reasonable quality of life. Once you have it::: it lives in your body forever and there is no cure. Over time::: that takes a toll on the body::: putting people living with HIV at greater risk for health conditions such as cardiovascular disease::: kidney disease::: diabetes::: bone disease::: liver disease::: cognitive disorders::: and some types of cancer. We know this because it has been around for years::: and had been studied medically for years. ""Now with COVID-19::: we have a novel virus that spreads rapidly and easily. The full spectrum of symptoms and health effects is only just beginning to be cataloged::: much less understood. ""So far the symptoms may include: Fever Fatigue Coughing Pneumonia Chills/ Trembling Acute respiratory distress Lung damage (potentially permanent) Loss of taste (a neurological symptom) Sore throat Headaches Difficulty breathing Mental confusion Diarrhea Nausea or vomiting Loss of appetite Strokes have also been reported in some people who have COVID-19 (even in the relatively young) Swollen eyes Blood clots Seizures Liver damage Kidney damage Rash COVID toes (weird::: right?) ""People testing positive for COVID-19 have been documented to be sick even after 60 days. Many people are sick for weeks::: get better::: and then experience a rapid and sudden flare up and get sick all over again. A man in Seattle was hospitalized for 62 days::: and while well enough to be released::: still has a long road of recovery ahead of him. Not to mention a $1.1 million medical bill. ""Then there is MIS-C. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children is a condition where different body parts can become inflamed::: including the heart::: lungs::: kidneys::: brain::: skin::: eyes::: or gastrointestina l organs. Children with MIS-C may have a fever and various symptoms::: including abdominal pain::: vomiting::: diarrhea::: neck pain::: rash::: bloodshot eyes::: or feeling extra tired. While rare::: it has caused deaths. ""This disease has not been around for years. It has basically been 6 months. No one knows yet the long-term health effects::: or how it may present itself years down the road for people who have been exposed. We literally *do not know* what we do not know. ""For those in our society who suggest that people being cautious are cowards::: for people who refuse to take even the simplest of precautions to protect themselves and those around them::: I want to ask::: without hyperbole and in all sincerity: ""How dare you? ""How dare you risk the lives of others so cavalierly. How dare you decide for others that they should welcome exposure as 'getting it over with'::: when literally no one knows who will be the lucky 'mild symptoms' case::: and who may fall ill and die. Because while we know that some people are more susceptible to suffering a more serious case::: we also know that 20 and 30-year-olds have died::: marathon runners and fitness nuts have died::: children and infants have died. ""How dare you behave as though you know more than medical experts::: when those same experts acknowledge that there is so much we don't yet know::: but with what we DO know::: are smart enough to be scared of how easily this is spread::: and recommend baseline precautions such as: Frequent hand-washing Physical distancing Reduced social/public contact or interaction Mask wearing Covering your cough or sneeze Avoiding touching your face Sanitizing frequently touched surfaces ""The more things we can all do to mitigate our risk of exposure::: the better off we all are::: in my opinion. Not only does it flatten the curve and allow health care providers to maintain levels of service that aren't immediately and catastrophicall y overwhelmed; it also reduces unnecessary suffering and deaths::: and buys time for the scientific community to study the virus in order to come to a more full understanding of the breadth of its impacts in both the short and long term. ""I reject the notion that it's 'just a virus' and we'll all get it eventually. What a careless::: lazy::: heartless stance.”",Wonder how the CD lying about the numbers that just came out will effect your decisions. 6 percent deaths of the 100 percent.

""oh::: but helps:::"" nope it hurts because you need to be exposed to pathogens to build your adaptive immune responses to protect you from that virus. But People Are Getting Sick Even If They Don't Die... Nope::: not so fast.

Your Immune Responses Is The Strongest Barrier and the Strongest Mask Available to fend off Viruses::: Bacteria::: i.e. Pathogens. If they have no answer::: it is because they're either clueless to the body's natural defenses or have an agenda behind forcing you to wear a mask.

We will be rethinking the idea of sending our children to OU.,Leonie Rieken the comments ahahahaa people need education. Desperately,Shelley Bloodworth Gattenby,Justin- then why do you have auto insurance ? Why not smoke in a restaurant or airplane ? Do you wear a seatbelt ? If you do::: then why are you? Are you a sheep doing that? Maybe not. Maybe it’s because it’s the smart thing to do. Maybe it’s better for us as a whole society . I’ve heard this sheep concept from a number of people. I’m truly interested in what’s underneath your thoughts.,lol imagine being so scientifically illiterate and unempathetic that you can't process advancing scientific literature and recommendations enough to know we have long since passed the point of wearing masks to protect ourselves::: but instead to protect others around us due to the long incubation period of the virus. OR they do know::: and don't care::: because they are selfish and fail the shopping cart test every time. Like yeah bro sure::: driving in the right lane might not protect me from all traffic incidents and it might be more convenient to drive straight down the middle of the road::: but a vague concern for the well being of your fellow man might warrant following the social convention here. But idk. Just spitballing. Costs 0 dollars to give a hoot about human people.,Both look awesome! As an alumnus from OU::: I really wish the campus remained as beautiful as ever during this difficult period!,Masks with lots of visible holes. Yup. That’ll stop a virus alright.,Just keep it safe!

She had a 9 month love affair with my husband knowing he was married with two young boys at home!  They had sex throughout OU Medical in Garrison Tower::: where the Biocontainment Unit is located. This is a highly RESTRICTED area where Physicians sleep while taking a break from caring for patients with infectious diseases! I’m very upset that Lin still holds a position as Director of Operations for The Clinical Skills Education and Testing Center::: even after they’ve been caught on video entering this restricted area! I’m furious that my Tax dollars are paying this whore her six figure salary!  My soon to be ex-husband was immediately terminated from his position while Lin has been able to keep her job & her salary! OU and their HR Department should be ashamed that they’ve swept this deviant::: sexual behavior under the rug!  So why am I posting this you ask? It’s because I’m a devastated woman who hasn’t just lost a husband but my family is now ripped apart! I want people to know that women like Lin Goldston make women like me a 50% statistic of divorce and broken homes. I want her to be embarrassed and take responsibility for her actions! I want her to suffer financially the same way we did when my husband was terminated from his job. He’s definitely getting his Karma::: I hope and pray Lin Goldston finally gets hers!,No day is a good day to wear a mask.. 😯,Please keep it up OU! This alumna is proud,Chris Collins,Mysherl Hilliard,Holding my finger up too...its the middle one,Yesss!!! Way to get it right!!

Oh::: the OU faculty haven't told you this yet? It's coming sheep and it is for everyone's protection::: bah baah...  You would think that the OU faculty were smart enough to say::: hey students::: get Tested to see if you're immune compromised and then teach their students that they can bring their immune system back into balance because your immune responses Is You Freaken Mask... Now::: you won't hear this on campus because they don't want you to learn this fact. Pay attention...

However::: in NYC (where I’m from) and Las Vegas (where I live)::: there actually are people who are getting sick and dying. It must be nice to be in your own world without regard for reality. God forbid a person does something for other people::: such as wearing a mask. My son is a senior who has decided to stay home and take one online class rather than pay out-of-state tuition so that he is not wasting his money when the school::: inevitably::: gets shut down. I wish people would have just worn masks and practiced social distancing from the beginning so that life would be back to normal by now!,Cue the anti-masker nutters....,SNOWFLAKES everywhere,My son missed out on the last part of his senior year! So we are thankful he gets to enjoy his freshman year at OU!! Our family has been nothing but impressed with how they are handling things!,Ridiculous,Dear OU::: stop embarrassing yourself. Grow a backbone and learn to stand up for something even when it seems you’re the only one. Don’t be a follower and act like a giant puppet on a string just to save face and keep the revenue. I would hope you’re better than that. In the name of “education”::: don’t teach fear. Teach history on how we’ve overcome nearly everything we’ve ever faced — without a mask on — and we continue to grow. Don’t let this scamdemic be anything it’s not. Teach truth::: not fear and status quo.  Sincerely:::  A long time OU fan  P.s.

I work in health care::: I mask for my patients.  I am diabetic::: please mask for me so I don't get sick and take that home to my wife and elderly mother-in-law.  I just turned 49. I want to see 50. 80 would be nice too.,Aren’t the classes going virtual?,I don't mask,Doug Hutchinson,No one l love my freedom and l take the cure ..,While we're on the topic of ensuring each others safety::: when will we making carrying a gun mandatory? I carry to protect me and my family::: when are the rest of you going to start carrying to protect me?,What a bunch of human garbage in these comments #WearTheDamnMask,I only mask so I dont get fined... its so silly to think a piece of cloth is going to protect u from a virus... hope all u mask people wear masks everyday the rest of ur lives... i mean if it saves one person from getting the flu right?,Unbelievable the amount of ignorant ::: selfish::: and arrogant comments on here. Every time they spew out their garbage thinking is like an episode of the Twilight Zone or a nightmare one can’t shake off.,Masking for football,Well the CDC for one. They had to admit masks dont help.,All of my wonderful guests that comes through my line at Target in Yukon !,What selfish people!

No thank you.,I mask for anyone who has health problems because I don't want to be the cause of complications or death!,This is the only mask I will wear.,Manny Rodriguez,I have something thats bigger than me::: bigger than science.,Don't be like Herman.,Speaking of the risks of the China-originate d coronavirus to children::: Redfield said data shows the flu is some five to 10 times more deadly::: adding that the odds of a child dying a COVID-linked death is “one in a million.”,98.2 % of all covid deaths were very old and had co-morbidities. The shutting down of schools is the teachers union conspiring with the dnc. We know what the plan is.,Bob Nicholas,If you wear pants and I don't::: I can pee on your leg and it will still get some on you. If we both wear pants::: my pee stays on my pants::: not on yours.,"This post is obviously designed for the sheeple falling in line with the mask requirement because they ""follow the science"". I'm glad to still see some freedom loving Americans who refuse to bow the knee to their mask masters of the Sheeple",Those masks have been proven in precovid tests to have roughly a 97% viral transmission rate. So say you're asymptomatic::: won't matter. If you are symptomatic::: you stay home/isolated/ quarantined. So unless you want to supply a N95 or better (how about a M40 NBC mask and cartridge)::: you're wasting your breathe. Quite literally.,Check it out::: Bob Nicholas: E way back before all the cool kids were masking...,Cory J. Nicolson,Retarded people are funny especially the one's who have a mask on by themselves in the car::: like they don't wanna get the car sick. There is some really special people out there.,"THE CAT IS OUT OF THE BAG... THE CDC::: THE WHO::: AND ALL THE SO-CALLED EXPERTS LIED TO YOU!!! HERE'S THE LIST: @ 20/20  ⚠️ EVERYONE IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY NEEDS TO READ THIS AND ABSORB IT... THOSE STILL ASLEEP::: YOU BETTER WAKE UP BECAUSE THIS SHAM/DRESS REHEARSAL WILL CERTAINLY BE THE LAST CHANCE; THOSE CHOOSING TO REMAIN IN DENIAL::: GIVING THE FINGER TO REALITY::: YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN ...  FEEL “FREE” TO FACT CHECK EACH OF THESE::: PLEASE!  🔺""CDC admitted they screwed up COVID19 infection counts and intentionally misled the public and have apologized::: clarifying that the amount of people truly infected is much lower than what was originally reported -\-\ an error so egregious it made the director of the Harvard Global Health Institute say “how could the CDC make this mistake? This is a mess."" 🔺The American Coronavirus Task Force also admitted to fudging the National COVID19 death count when Dr. Birx said the deaths are people who died “with” COVID19 not “from” COVID19::: thus making the real death count much lower than what is currently being reported. 🔺Dr. Anthony Fauci admitted masks won’t help against the virus and mask manufacturers are now including warnings that their products do not deter COVID19. 🔺Fauci also said that continuing to close the country could cause irreparable damage. 🔺CDC backtracked their initial claim that led governors to shutdown their states & clarified that COVID19 does not spread easily on surfaces. 🔺Governor of New York Andrew Cuomo confirmed a recent health study showing that 70% of new infections actually originate at home::: thus making stay at home orders one of the most dangerous mandates currently in place. 🔺Trump stopped funding the WHO and threatened to cut off money permanently until they can prove they are no longer corruptly influenced by communist China after they lied to our country about human to human transmission of COVID19 in January. 🔺The curve is flattened::: the CDC::: WHO::: Dr. Fauci::: our governors::: and many more were completely wrong about the potential threat of this virus. 🔺If you are still living in fear::: Don’t be. The media::: global organizations::: the government::: and its agencies “mislead” the public. 🔺People called those of us who knew this all along conspiracy theorists::: but it turns out we were just following the facts! 🔺Open up your businesses::: churches::: and homes. Don’t fall for the lies any longer. If you fell for the lies this time::: wake up and join the army of truth seekers fighting on the front lines. 🔺 Florida has just admitted to miscalculations on some that received positive COVID-19 results but never got tested and many others have been incorrectly identified as positive in the state’s system. 🔺 WHO have just admitted that transmission of the virus from an asymptomatic carriers - the whole reason for the lockdown::: is rare!! ie you could not spread it before showing any symptoms!! ⚠️ The CDC just confirmed a .4 to .26% death-rate for Covid 19. The death rate for the flu shot is .6. Twice as high as Covid!  For that::: we have: • Added nearly 6 trillion to national debt • Laid-off or furloughed 50 million workers • Placed 60 million on food stamps • Gone from 3.5%to 14.7% unemployment • Crippled the petroleum industry • Ruined the tourism industry • Bankrupted the service industry • Caused an impending meat and protein crisis • Threatened::: fined::: and arrested church leaders • Exacerbated mental health problems • Shut down schools and colleges • Given unbridled power to unelected officials • Increased suicides higher than COVID deaths • Delayed surgeries and treatments for profound illnesses • Infringed upon countless important civil liberties • Placed 300 million Americans on house arrest Bill Gates has placed himself in such a position of influence by heavily funding all corners to make this lie happen.  We need to start treating it as the lie it is. Seriously our whole way of life is at stake::: and they have plans to make it much worse now introducing it as ""the grand reset""::: ""the beginning of the 4th revolution"" (ie a surveillance state of control::: where everyone lives in what is essentially a strick open air prison where you are tracked::: nothing is private::: and everything is decided for you::: and you have no rights whatsoever::: and there can be no resistance.

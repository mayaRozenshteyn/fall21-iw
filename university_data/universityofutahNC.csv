Sponsored by @uofu_isaa::: the Red Dress Project aims to bring awareness about the missing and murdered Indigenous women and people in North America.  In the U.S.::: homicide is the third leading cause of death among Native American women between the ages of 10-24::: which is more than 10x the national average for women of other races. Utah is ranked 8th for the number of missing and murdered Indigenous women. • #mmiw #reddressproject,2021-11-17 03:07:48,To those who want a visual of how severe and underrepresente d the issue is::: go to Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women USA . It's absolutely shocking.,Give the land back::: you made millions and made massive profits from it. Like any landlord or corporation you would also charge interest. Give the land back or give all Native Americans free education and boarding. That would be honorable . The red dresses is solely for Murdered and Missing Indigenous women of North America and not all Indigenous women around the world and it’s not because people don’t care but it takes away from helping the cause here. It started as a Canadian issue. They are targeted by human traffickers and bike gangs even when there is zero affiliation to them::: that is a huge issue in our countries.,I had no idea about these statistics until about a week ago.,I thought wearing red was for cardiac awareness.

There are more than 27:::000 pieces of space debris bigger than the size of a softball currently orbiting Earth::: and they are traveling at speeds of up to 17:::500 mph::: fast enough for a small chunk to damage a satellite or spacecraft like an intergalactic cannonball.  Consequently::: cleaning up this space junk will be an important task if agencies are to shoot more rockets and satellites into orbit. Mechanical engineering professor Jake J. Abbott is leading a team of researchers that has discovered a method to manipulate orbiting debris with spinning magnets. With this technology::: robots could one day gently maneuver the scrap to a decaying orbit or further out into space without actually touching it::: or they could repair malfunctioning objects to extend their life.

#UofU students are required to be fully vaccinated against measles::: mumps and rubella (MMR). With the full FDA approval of the Pfizer #COVID19 vaccine::: the university is also requiring a COVID-19 vaccination.  Students who do not comply by either showing that they have received the vaccines or indicating an exemption will have a “hold” placed on their record that will prevent registration for future classes. All records need to be received by Sept. 30 to prevent a registration hold from being placed on accounts and preventing registration for the Spring 2022 semester. Subsequent completion of the requirement with the vaccine or an exemption will remove the hold.  ATTHEU.UTAH.EDU New vaccine requirement for U students | @theU,2021-09-07 19:28:48,As a parent::: the spouse of a physician::: and a current University of Utah student::: I agree with this decision. Last semester I had to start the MMR schedule over again because my test results showed I did not have sufficient immunity to mumps. All of my classes are online::: but I'm still happy to comply.,Absolutely LOVE seeing universities mandating this!!! The science is there::: for both ends of this. Thankfully::: insurance companies and many other businesses are also seeing the benefits of this vaccine::: as COVID positive patients being treated for COVID are mostly unvaccinated (89% in IHC hospitals)::: and these long hospital stays & the other cases of COVID they cause are hitting the economy with people who can’t show up for work and/or need insurance to pay for their care.  It’s a free shot (or two). Very few “medical conditions” are actually contraindicated for it (and yes::: I have seen some cases where it shouldn’t be given).,Thank you for this decision to keep us all safe!,This is the absolute right decision! Not surprised by all of the ridiculous negative comments!,And what about the football games? Bad look on CNN today,looks like Utah is turning blue,Thank you for making the right decision !!!,Students show their disapproval or approval w their $ and enrollment::: funny how that affects decisions.,Better late than never! Thanks for joining most major universities in the country,"I guess ""Never Again"" really doesn't matter anymore and we should overlook history in the name of ""safety:::"" so let's bring back ""show me your papers."" Bravo Zulu U. You should consider changing your red gear to brown to really fit in with the sheeple terrified of a cold that for a typical aged student is almost 100% survivable.",Thank you! Many vaccinations have been required of all of us for our whole lives. This one should be no different!,OMG::: IT IS NOT FDA APPROVED......O MG...SOMEONE WAKE UP!,And down the rabbit hole we go w some of these silly and downright ignorant comments. Get your damn shot or go elsewhere. Enough said.,The only shots college kids should have to take,Boooooo hissssss!!! Glad I'm not a student anymore.,Thanks for the decision to go scientific!,Fully support this decision,😲 I thought college students are generally adults and can make their own personal health choices? 😡Welcome to the New World Order!😡,One of these diseases is NOT like the others . So so wrong to dictate this medication to LOW risk population .,KNOW YOUR RIGHTS! Thanks to Utah law you can file an exemption based on Medical::: Religious::: OR Philosophical. You DO NOT have to give a reason::: that is OPTIONAL.,Why do all these people that aren't even students let alone students at the U care to comment on this? Lol we have proved that the Pfizer vaccine is miraculously effective against Covid::: in a similar manner to how the MMR vaccine is effective to those viruses. Stop making this political. And yeah::: I go here.,Fear and madness. A regrettable decision::: not based on any science.,Honest question. If the school already requires that students be vaccinated against measles::: mumps and rubella (MMR)::: All of which have FDA approved vaccines::: how is adding an FDA approved vaccine for another illness any different?,People with medical conditions can’t even get proper exemptions bc docs can only write so many in a year… So you are totally forcing your students with chronic illnesses to drop out or transfer.,Thank you for every effort to protect community health with scientifically based decisions. Couldn’t be prouder of my The University of Utah! 🙌,Thank you! Those of us who believe in science::: critical thought::: reasoning::: research::: and common sense support your wise decision.,This is an assult on personal sovereignty.,See above Bill which passed in May of 2021 that provides personal/ religious exemptions.,Thank you!!! We who believe in science are thrilled at the very responsible and very necessary step you are taking to protect both students::: staff and facility.,Thank you for protecting public health.,Legally they can't. You can sue them to uphold the state laws...,Sounds like Lawsuits to me,"As much as the media wants you to believe this is to protect society's health::: this is in no way ""in the name of health"". No physician or amount of credentials will change my or the majority of Americans' minds. You know it. I know it. This is about control. Just pay attention to the narrative and the way in which this is being forced across the Nation. And no::: this is not the same as MMR. If you really cared about health::: why don't you ban alcohol::: smoking::: cannabis etc... Must comply?? No thanks. I'd rather not follow the same fate as Nazi Germany.",Glad to see you’re doing what scientists and doctors recommend. Entirely appropriate for a University with strong science programs and a medical school. Go Utes!,Nice to see that the University cares more about what is easy then what is right. Very forward thinking there,The approved version of the vax hasn't become available yet. So they are technically forcing students to vax with the unapproved one. This needs to be held off until the official one is released widespread,UofU students I hope you know the law. You can get an exemption.,Great way to keep stupid people out of your school as well as having healthy students. Kudos,I was never asked to show proof of those other vaccines::: interesting,Yay! Communism! Don’t you just love that we’re no longer in charge of our own health decisions and::: better yet! We have to put them on display 😁 this new way of living is the American dream! I wish Washington could see us now! Maybe he’d slap some sense into you…,Does this include online classes or only in person?,My household was hit with Covid - the person unvaccinated was near hospitalization and was healthy with no pre existing conditions - the two with conditions were vaccinated and SURPRISE - nothing - there is enough proof in that to support the schools decision. Go Utes!,That’s the responsibility any college attendants have to make. When I decided to attend universities in the States from Japan::: I had to comply all the criteria and even for the vaccination and health requirements here in the United States and for the school. I am grateful that U of U is doing this.,Better find a different college.,Alejandra Peraza,Thank you 👏🏻,Seriously!! They making everything about their interest:::This is annoying right now.,And those all have had less cases of death combined than the rona DNA spike protein jab,Marshall Peterson,My weight was getting out of control and I couldn’t even walk up the stairs without getting out of breath. I was pretty worried about my heart and blood sugar levels and my doctor gave me enough warnings. When I starting taking this new tonic formula in the mornings::: I noticed the changes were happening after only 3 days. I felt like I had lots of new energy:::and the weight started dropping off real fast. I found the magic solution to my problem by reading this article https://bit.ly/ 3Bux1L1 I’d definitely recommend it if you want to make a change in your life for the better.,When did the u of u move to communist China?,Forced vaccination for a disease that currently is unlikely to cause serious harm to the individual is draconian.,AMEN! YES!,This is sad to make them all Guinea pigs,So I'm curious. Since the university is forcing the shot::: are they also going to pay for any side effects and medical treatment for the shot::: should the need come up?,Alyssa Thompson I'm ashamed to be a The University of Utah graduate 😔  Looks like our kid will NOT be going there 🤷‍♂️,Oh fuck off,Don't go to this school,For those that would rather pay a hefty hospital bill instead of getting a free vaccine. https:// www.forbes.com/ sites/ roberthart/2021/ 08/19/ the-cost-of-bein g-unvaccinated- just-went-up-\-\- most-insurers-a re-passing-cost s-back-to-patie nts-as-covid-ho spitalizations- soar/ ?fbclid=IwAR0PQE yI1uKSibuIbm7HW 0or1eeH3mKwOi3Y is42yGbnnFizusR CB5A2rB4&sh=2e4 9a1aebd9a,Good.,This is so disappointing!,https:// www.thechurchnew s.com/ leaders-and-mini stry/ 2021-08-12/ first-presidency -message-urges- latter-day-sain ts-wear-masks-v accines-222014,This is what i was telling you about at dinner ! Denise Rodgers,https:// youtu.be/ Zs4kAQAzT4w,Christina Cotterall,Believe in a guy talking to stones in a hat::: but not an approved vaccine::: go figure. 🤔,Boooo,Smart! 👌🏽,All you fools that say you believe in science::: why don't you support Ivermectin? You know the one drug that got the Nobel prize for being one of the most effective drugs in the world. The drug that been around for decades and has a proven track record? Oh wait::: it's because you don't really believe in science::: you believe in what you're only told to believe. Idiots.,Awww boohoo. Only people I see complaining here::: are people who don’t attend the University of Utah. Actual science trumps what ever excuses you have come up with through your extensive “hearsay research”. So please::: remove your tin foil hats and do some research on virology and vaccines. You anti vaxxers could all benefit from some legitimate education on the topic.,You are trash!,Well a vaccine is defined as: a substance used to stimulate the production of antibodies and provide IMMUNITY (which the Covid-19 vaccine does not do) against one or several diseases::: prepared from the causative agent of a disease::: its products::: or a synthetic substitute::: treated to act as an antigen without inducing the disease.,Does it matter to you that young people have a 99.8++ recovery rate? Will you mandate regular boosters? Does it matter to you that none of the available jabs are out of the experimental stage? Does it matter to you that the various jabs are extremely problematic and causing harm to tens of thousands of people? This is beyond sickening.,Grrrrrrrr,Megan Carney-Zurkan,The college respectfully requests those who aren’t vaccinated wear this:,Discrimination. Unconstitutiona l.,Nicely done.,Marjorie Haun,Woohoo! Great job U of U!,Utah Government: Get the Vaccine  Utah Health Officials: Get the Vaccine  Utah religious leaders: Get the Vaccine  Utah’s best university: Get The Vaccine  I’m glad to see the U will be on the right side of history. #GoUtes,This is disgusting,"The largest law firm confirms that the FDA deceived America with its incomprehensibl e"" approval "" of the Pfizer vaccine.  When the US Food and Drug Administration announced on August 23 that it had fully approved the first Covid vaccine under the brand name Comirnaty::: the mainstream media immediately started reporting on the events. Joe Biden jumped in front of the microphone and told businesses that they should ""strengthen"" the mandatory introduction of vaccines for their employees.  Dr. Anthony Fauci told national media that he expects a number of new ""mandates"" that will be triggered by the approval of the Pfizer vaccine.  There is only one problem. The FDA ""approved"" the wrong Pfizer vaccine that is currently available on the American market.  Some people looked under the facade and checked the facts of what the FDA really did::: and not what the media and the Joe Biden administration said.  On August 27::: Liberty Counsel of Orlando::: Florida::: arguably the most respected Christian law firm in the country::: issued a press release confirming the deception.  ""The FDA has taken the bait by announcing that it has approved its ""first vaccine against COVID-19"" in order to advance the requirements of the ""vaccine"" and protect the pharmaceutical company Pfizer from legal liability. However::: there is currently no fully licensed COVID vaccine on the US market. Although this is confusing::: and probably intentional::: it summarizes the current status of Pfizer-BioNTech injections:  All existing Pfizer vials (hundreds of millions) remain under the Federal Emergency Use Permit (EUA) (which means that people have the ""option to accept them or refuse"");  The third or"" booster "" injection of Pfizer is identical to the one above and remains within the EUA with limited use for certain categories of people;  BioNTech has received FDA approval for people aged 16 and older under the name Comirnaty::: but there are no Comirnaty doses available in the United States;  In other words::: there is CURRENTLY NO FDA-approved COVID-19 injection in the United States. All COVID vaccinations in America are subject to the EUA law::: and thus people have a ""choice to accept or reject"" them;  Even when COVID vaccination approved by the Food and Drug Administration becomes available::: people are protected by federal law and the laws of many states from being forced to receive these vaccinations based on their sincere religious beliefs or rights of conscience.""  This all works not only in the USA. This applies to the entire vaccine as a whole.",Annie Anh Do,Lori Riewaldt,Thank you for doing everything you can to keep our campus safe. And for following the science.  🥰🥰🥰,People literally inject their small children with 50 (I’m exaggerating ) vaccines in order for them to be able to go to school but mandatory vaccinations for adults cause an uproar . 🤷🏼‍♀️ I don’t get it . This vaccine has all the crazy crap in it that every other vaccine has in it. I am incredibly impressed with the school choosing the safety of their students over everything else especially being in a state where there are a lot of conspiracy theorists who don’t believe COVID is real. Proud Ute 👏🏻,Yes!!!!,Go Utes 💜,"As the ONLY FDA approved vaccine is Pfizer’s ""Comirnaty"" vaccine (and NOT the currently adminstered Pfizer-BioNTech Covid vaccine under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)) where is the University making that Comirnaty shot available?

Students::: go out and find your place at the Get Involved Fair! Hundreds of student organizations from across campus will be camping out on the Union Plaza. #UofU #GetInvolved,2021-09-01 03:39:23,Camping is it.
What’s it going to take to we have a successful fall semester? President Randall and students discuss how we’re all in this together and it’s up to the whole campus community working as one to achieve a healthy and happy return to the U.,2021-08-30 19:28:04
As the #COVID19 pandemic continues to impact our community::: state leaders this week have granted all Utah System of Higher Education institutions greater flexibility to set vaccine policy for their campuses. We intend to pursue requiring COVID-19 vaccination for our students.  ATTHEU.UTAH.EDU Student vaccine requirement | @theU,2021-08-27 20:30:31,Thank you for making this decision to protect the health of students and their families!,I am a physician and mom of a Ute.  I hope the vaccine is mandated. Students who opt out of vaccination::: can (for their safety and for the safety of others) learn remotely.,More places need to start mandating this. When the polio vaccine was first created::: people lined up for this lifesaving miracle and it definitely helped save a generation of lives. Just a few decades later and people think they’re too good to accept similarly lifesaving vaccinations. How dumb and self important we have become as a people.,As a healthcare provider at the University of Utah Medical Center::: we thank you for this decision! We know firsthand how devastating this disease is. Thank you for being an advocate for us! ❤️,I hope you will consider options for those who are unable to take the vaccine. There are some who the vaccine is a greater risk than the illness.,Here is a link to the bill passed in the 2021 General Session: txtly.me/ 3BkSS7m  The bill enacted this code section: txtly.me/ 3gEOcS9  Utah’s representatives worked as a legislative body and with community advocates to prevent universities from requiring vaccines for attendance and to prevent them from forcing a student to take online classes if they are unwilling to receive a vaccine. The language in the bill covers all vaccines.  Any student may attend any state university or institute of higher education without vaccination by submitting a personal exemption certificate to the university. A certificate should be emailed to you at the end of the online module found here: txtly.me/ 3jjG0IC,"I would rather be vaccinated and listen to real medical doctors and nurses than listen to what a bunch of YouTube streamers and random political people with no medical knowledge whatsoever say about the Vaccine and ""Freedom"".",Great decision! May more follow in your footsteps. To the unvaccinated: years ago we all agreed that second hand smoke was so dangerous that we should not allow smoking indoors. You can still smoke::: but not inside. This is no different. Covid is so dangerous that the U has decided the unvaccinated cannot come inside. You can still choose to not be vaccinated::: but you cannot come inside and breathe your covid all over the rest of us. You want to join society? Great. Get vaccinated. You don’t want to join society? Fine::: sit outside with the smokers::: y’all can fight over who gets the last oxygen tank.,Notice how all these negative comments are NOT coming from current students? I feel I speak for me and my classmates when I say piss off! This effects us not you. If you don’t want to get the shot that’s fine. But we’re the ones going up to campus everyday and sitting in auditoriums with 200 plus people. Let the students voice their opinions and stop trying to complain about something that doesn’t effect you.  Also before you start spouting the::: “it should be a choice” rhetoric::: read the actual thing. The U will be offering exemptions next week for anyone who wants to opt out based on personal or religious beliefs. Generally it’s a good thing to actually know what the university is going to do before whining about it. Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk.,Bravo U! This is amazing. A proud alumni here.,It’s insane to read all these comments of how many people are for this mandate. I’m amazed every day how people literally do not understand the data between this disease and others and how this one is not even close to many other diseases on death rate. But yet people are so willing to bend over and give up their constitutional freedoms and think that others should be required to put an experimental drug in their body. It’s insane. You’re scared of Covid::: and I’m scared of how easy it was to convince you to give up your human rights,As a faculty member walking through a crowded and often unmasked campus::: thank you.,Thank you! As an alumni and parent of a new freshman::: I am so grateful for this news. Proud to be a Ute!,I agree completely with this decision.,Somea y’all could have benefited from a class in statistics from the brilliant::: hilarious Dr. Dan E. Jones. May he rest in numbers from highly reliable data.,Horrible! Very disappointed!,Instead of mandating vaccines::: you should have allowed distance learning and given more options to students for online classes. This could have been solved with more freedom and not a mandate. You failed.,As a RN and a parent of a UofU student... Thank you for this!!,The Vaccine Is not the End all! My Son was fully vaccinated and STILL just got Covid….. False Security— anyone can get it after being vaccinated.. don’t buy in to this.. and he is an alumni 🤷🏼‍♀️,Authoritarianis m at its finest. Marxism in a nutshell. Gross.,"All because students want to choose for themselves? Yall are great at defending that when it comes to sexual ""identity"" and ""Preference"" but when it comes to health decisions::: somehow it's okay to force people into following a rule?  The double standard that not only this overhyped university::: but America's liberal left follows is absolutely 100% pathetic and shows they only care about what's popular and themselves. They are ""Pro-Choice"" unless your choice contradicts theirs. Sad and depressing that so many have fallen in this state. We truly have lost all hope at unification.",This is a bad choice and requirement for your students. Please don’t do this.,Happy the U is doing this. Thank you. USC::: UCLA and other Pac-12 schools are already doing this.,Communism at its best. I am a U grad and glad I am not there anymore,The State of Utah will not ever demand this.,"It was the fault of ""State Leaders"" in the first place.",And our staff??!! I would hope so…,Wait until ya'll find out that this isn't the only required vaccine 😬,Thank you President Randall for following science.,Expected that from a university that hosted the New World Order United Nations. 😡,Thank you <3. As a current student and staff member who has to attend classes in person and on campus I appreciate the U taking the safety of the campus community seriously. I 100% agree with this decision.,Yes! Imagine a University trusting the science and scientists!!! Well done U of U! Stand your ground for the health of everyone on campus!,Don’t::: unless you are also willing to accept the liability of any negative impact to any students caused by such mandate.🥰🥰🥰,Thank you! I’d be glad to see a policy like this to help protect our professors and vulnerable populations.,Thank for protecting our health! As a student at the U::: I appreciate this decision!!,So I guess since you are requiring this you can be sued if anything goes wrong when getting vaccinated. That would make sense. You force it one people so if they have a reaction from it or even die the U of U is responsible.,As a PhD student and a teaching assistant I appreciate what the U has been doing since the beginning of this pandemic! The vaccines save lives and protect the community!!!!,Thank you for your thoughtful and bold stance to provide the best public health interventions to protect your students and our community!,Thank you! Don’t back down with all the folks trying to make political statements with a vaccine. Utah is a bastion of medical science and requiring vaccines is right on line with that!,So after students have committed::: moved in and paid tuition::: NOW you are going to mandate a vaccine? How convenient. We chose this school based on a persons right to choose. We would have chosen differently had we known you would change policy 1 week into the semester.,"People whining about ""vaccine passports""...  just like EVERY school::: proof of immunizations is required for all grades::: and has been required for YEARS. You know::: HPV::: Hep B::: pneumococcal::: Rubella::: Hib::: Polio::: MMR::: DPT::: Mumps...",Of course you wait until a majority of students pay tuition. Ran like a business::: you don’t care who’s safe you just want the $$$,Trust science and do the right thing…. I understand individual right to decide but sometimes the concept of “the common good “ takes priority.,Can you tell me the long term effects from the vaccine? You can't because we are barely 1 yeat into the study. These students are our future. Wait until the 2 year::: 5 year::: 10 year study results are out before you mandate.,As a parent of a student and a U Health employee::: I appreciate the U's approach very much.,"You know youre drunk on conservatism when ""COVID vaccine"" makes you think ""Marxism!"" smh",I am very relieved. My student has all of her vaccines. She spent a year at home due to covid. The sooner we can eliminate the potential for serious sickness of this disease::: the sooner we can all get back to our normal lives.,It’s sad how people fold in fear and yield to the temptation to rule others!,Congrats UOfU.. if BYU was requiring masks & vaccinations::: there wasn’t much Cox could say!!! We want covid 19 gone & all future variants gone!!,And wait…. there’s more. They will include all the booster shots as well. Yay!!! 🙌🏻,Thank you for leading the fight against COVID-19 in our young adults.,Thank you! Thank you for advocating for us the students!,Bravo !!! This is a good thing.,You gotta love the bitching and the angry emojis coming from the people who have ABSOLUTELY nothing to do with the U. If you don’t attend the U or work there::: then shut it with your ignorant anti-vaccine “feelings” and “opinions” 🙄🤦🏻‍♀️. Thank you U of U for the mandate.,Thank you for protecting your students::: our children.,Great decision ❤️ proud to be a ute 🙂,Don’t be communist! Choice is better!,So will the school be held liable for any deaths or adverse interactions like GBS::: myocarditis or antibody dependant enhancement? I guess this science doesn't agree politically so we should ignore it at all costs right 👍,Well::: that’s unfortunate.,Very surprised to hear so many women that were fighting for “my body::: my right” instantly feel OK about forced vaccinations of any sort 🤷🏻‍♂️,Well done! Those who refuse can enroll into BYU!,I'm a proud supporter of the University of Utah but very ashamed by your poor choices. I hope you lose millions if not more by your poor choice.,"UofU's ""scientific"" source: https:// www.facebook.com / 100001093397003/ posts/ 4491719784207757 /",Posted by a Utah state legislator:  Here is a link to the bill we passed in the 2021 General Session: txtly.me/ 3BkSS7m  The bill enacted this code section: txtly.me/ 3gEOcS9  We worked as a legislative body and with community advocates to prevent universities from requiring vaccines for attendance and to prevent them from forcing a student to take online classes if they are unwilling to receive a vaccine.

A certificate should be emailed to you at the end of the online module found here: txtly.me/ 3jjG0IC,Lisa Kwant Nielsen,Finally!! Thank you 🙏,Perhaps UofU should check out STATE LAW in HB 1007 section 53B-2-113 (1&2). ANY person may claim a medical or religious exemption with a simple written statement to the University::: upon which you shall::: by state law::: exempt said person of your attempts at medical discrimination.  https:// le.utah.gov/ ~2021S1/bills/ static/ HB1007.html,The safe and effective vaccine as of August 20th 2021 reporting::: is responsible for over 41% of all vaccine adverse reactions ever reported to VAERS::: and has had: 623:::341 adverse reactions Including: 13:::627 deaths 55:::821 hospitalization s 74:::368 urgent care visits 1:::671 miscarriages 6:::071 heart attacks 5:::094 myocarditis/ pericarditis 17:::794 permanent disabilities 25:::921 severe allergic reactions 7:::324 shingles  Facebook fact checkers can source VAERS COVID Vaccine Data from the CDC website.,My condolences to the anti-vaxxers.,A covid jab mandate would discriminate against vegans and prolifers. Of course ::: in addition to being poorly thought out ::: such an action would be immoral ::: illegal and possibly fattening .,Why would you require something that is a risk to the individual::: only a potential benefit to the individual::: and is a private health decision? There are many reasons people wouldn’t qualify to be a candidate for the injection. There are other reasons they may decide that their risk is lower with the virus than with the injection::: as it is for most college age kids::: and yet there is a huge number of students that have recovered from infection. So why would someone take unnecessary risk for protection inferior to what they already have? Also::: did I mention a private health decision? How do you figure this is anyone’s business?,Playing at do tor . So wrong !,My struggle with this decision is that vaccinated individuals can still shed the virus. There are alternatives to the vaccine that are also not be recognized.,Good news,Wise decision U!,Unconstitutiona l. You can't in good faith mandate a flu shot::: you cant mandate covid that has less mortality than Influenza in children. The adverse event profiles are more dangerous than getting covid itself. Already stated by the governing bodies. Covid effects less than 1 percent of the population. Influenza has been killing hundreds of thousands of ppl for half a century and noone cares. McDonald's kills more Utes than covid ever will. Freedom of choice. You want an abortion or a vaccine? Go get one::: and if you dont then thats also an option that has to be equally respected. . So please stfu about the self righteous bullshit. Stop using an agenda and trying to make it about safety when its about government compliance. Sad as an alumni that you are pursuing something that is wrong at the core.,Thank you ❤️,Thank God!,This is unconstitutiona l! This vaccine has not been studied long enough. In actuality::: you could be mandating a death sentence::: deformed offspring::: or who knows how many abnormalities! This is discrimination!,Better safe than intubated...,And this is why I love the U!,To quote a old saying. It’s my body and I can do what I want with my body,Thank you!,https:// www.abc4.com/ news/local-news/ draper-teenager- hospitalized-wi th-blood-clots- after-covid-19- vaccine-shot/,Crimes against humanity.,👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼,If I had family college age::: I’d sue! This breaks the law. HB308 has been signed by Gov Cox,Thank you!!,I hope you guys are seriously considering mandating that all professors provide a remote option using resources from the last two semester for students who are at risk::: and students who also have skepticism about the vaccine still. (I am vaccinated but this is still a concerning practice)  Requiring students get a vaccine 2-3-4 years into their programs they were never aware of was going to occur without providing alternative options to allow them to finish what they've started is a terrible precedent to set. The past 3 semesters have shown that the U can provide a solid remote option for most of their programs so why it's not offered is really confusing especially in times where it's truly a matter of life or death for some. I'm just asking this damn administration to give it's students a choice to graduate without compromising their health in the process.  Online options reduce crowding in classrooms::: allows the students that do come in still to socially distance thanks to reduced capacity::: provides safe environments for immunocompromis ed or high risk students allowing them to stay quarantined::: and allows those that feel the vaccine is unsafe for some reason or that they shouldn't have to wear a mask to stay at home as well if they don't like those conditions.  And if the answer is because you're following Utah Legislature why aren't the U::: BYU::: and other Utah Universities as well as high schools and middle schools standing in solidarity for the health of their teachers and student::: like what's more important getting kids in a classroom to meet a quota or allowing kids a safe option to get an education.,#Nope,Go Utes! 🙌,Why are you requiring immunizations for students but aren’t requiring vaccinations or masks at football games with 50000 + people sitting shoulder to shoulder.? Very hypocritical of the University of Utah whose hospital is constantly promoting both masks and vaccinations.,So profoundly delusional. Pull your head out of the sand::: folks. Vaccinated people are still spreaders!,You all are assigning people to there deaths. Why would you care more money in your pocket!!!,God bless Texas !,You do that and I’ll withdraw my daughter from the school. Will spend our money elsewhere. Her body::: her choice!!!!,Excellent call as usual- proud of U,Thank you!!! Smart choice.,Thank you!!!!,Way to go::: Alma Mater!,Sheep 🐑🐏🐑🐏🐑,Vaccines are poison and not safe for everyone.,Are you not watching Israel and Iceland? They are almost fully vaxxed countries and they are on the “do not travel” to list from USA since they are hot spots of Covid!!! Trust the science is watching these countries and their variants and hospitalization rates! They are showing the jabs don’t work!! And now you want to mandate these toxic jabs with no long term studies with adverse reactions off the charts!!! VAERS shows the death from these jabs equals more in 6 months than 20+ years of all other vaccines added up in America!! Why isn’t there a push for natural immunity? Look at antibodies in students’ blood for Covid? Why push these vaccines with no long term studies? Do not make our children be guinea pigs for Big Pharma!!! 😡 Covid has over 99% survival rate and that’s without treatment!!! With treatment it is even higher!! And college students are not at risk of Covid!! But they are at risk of adverse reactions to the jabs!! Myocarditis and blood clots are high!! Our children are not your lab rats!!! Please follow Dr. Robert Malone::: inventor of mRNA technology::: Dr. Robert McCullough::: Dr. Tenpenny and Dr. Michael Yeadon from Pfizer!!! These doctors are raising the alarm!!! These jabs are not the answer to Covid!!,Not okay! 😡,Trust science.. Lol. That's why we have 52 genders?,Terrible policy!,Show me your papers!,Go Utes!,That’s disappointing.,Way to go U of U!,That’s bullshit.,People are going to find out from November through May::: that these vaccines do not work::: and are destroying the immune systems of their youth. It all boils down to the NIH::: FDA::: and CDC deliberately not treating people when they get sick::: and then when they go into the hospital::: give them the failed Ebola Drug that did not even make it through trials::: and never approved for any disease::: that is destroying the internal organs and causing kidney failure. 😢 Then they give steroids::: that suppresses and destroys the immune system::: and leaves those who sick wide open to the worst bacterial infections like MRSA and other deadly bacteria. I have taken Chemical and Biological warfare::: and would have nightmares each year::: after the training::: realizing what is out there::: and these biolabs can create anything. I consider these vaccinations also a bioweapon that will harm millions in the long run. This all could have been avoided had they treated COVID patients when they first got sick with available therapies::: 85% of people who have died would still be alive.,Good! Vaccines should be mandated nationally. Those who refuse to get vaccinated are like those who drink-and-drive ::: endangering the lives of their communities! You have the right to get drunk::: but you do not have the right to drive and endanger the lives of others!,Why would you mandate a vaccine that doesn’t prevent transmission but not recognize natural antibodies which do prevent transmission? 1/3 of Utah has already had Covid and recovered. It’s unethical to force an unnecessary medical treatment.  https:// www.sciencemag.o rg/news/2021/ 08/ having-sars-cov- 2-once-confers- much-greater-im munity-vaccine- no-infection-pa rties,Yes!,Federal law 21 U.S. Code 360 prohibits mandating the covid vaccinations. The covid vaccinations are classified as emergency use authorized vaccinations and have not been through the two years of necessary clinical trials they are considered EXPERIMENTAL.,Thank you U of U!!!,Communists,Woohoo!,Yay! Great news,Aaron::: hmmm,Typical state run institution. Follow the propaganda. Look at the facts people. Stop being sheep 🐑,What's the survival rate for teenagers? If you have an underlying condition or are elderly and have been vaccinated. Why would you be scared.. Do the vaccines not work?? Why stick a healthy teenager with a vaccine that they don't need.. The reverend Jesse Jackson had the vaccine he's in a hospital in Chicago with Covid.. My sister is an ER nurse in Savannah Georgia. Half of their vaccinated staff tested positive for Covid a couple weeks ago... I don't know who to believe anymore..but I don't see a reason for a healthy teenager to get a vaccine..,That’s so communist of U.,Thank you so much!!!,So you are considering forcing a vaccine that has no long term studies::: that every day in the news the effectiveness percentage is dropping::: and you’re not considering natural immunity from having Covid? Take a look at how well Israel is doing with their vaccines and Covid. Take a look at the higher percentage of negative reactions for people who have had Covid and receive the vaccine. I truly did not think this university would cave that easily. More then slightly disappointed!,Good thing i graduated already 🤬,That's insane,AAPSONLINE.org is the vaccine safe? See for yourself,Good grief! So glad I graduated from the U a long time ago.,Great news::: thank you!,Amanda Ruiz,Finally! Thank you!,Finally!,No surprise. We all knew the U was the devil's school.,Haley Bowen Hastings,Forcing this is not the American way. No one knows the long term effects of the vaccine and the fact that the vaccines are not proving to prevent or stop the spread is concerning. Let students decides. It’s their bodies so it should be their choice . Would be a completely different situation if it was more effective .,Woohoo! Go U of U!!,👏,ML Watford,As an RN and mother to a UofU student::: I thank you!,Thank you!!,This comment section is a JOURNEY 😆,Shame on the U! Boo!,Looks like I’m going to be dropping out 😭 my dreams will not be coming true,Yikes,Kevin J. Gulbransen::: interesting,SMART!!! Great job 👏,👍🏻,Molly Neve 👏🏻👏🏻,🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️,Thank you!,Unbelievable.,#miloradpupovac,Will you also require boosters every 5 months?,Ann Brown,Thank you!,Dumb move,Jamie McGregor Klimt,Martin Gomez,But people that get the shot are super spreaders and causing more dangerous variants. Vaccines stop the spread of a virus. If a person can get the COVID shot and still spread COVID::: then it’s not a vaccine. It’s a therapy.,Stupid,Thank you!!,👏👏👏,Please don’t!,👎,Thank you!,Shame on U!,Thank you!,Per the Pfizer vaccine study the placebo was nearly as effective at preventing contraction of Covid-19 as the vaccine without any adverse side-effects. Additionally::: the continued spike in “breakthrough” cases in the vaccinated and reduced efficacy (some studies show ~ 66%) are showing the vaccine isn’t as effective as first touted. As an R1 designated university::: I expect better from the U than to buy into the false narrative being presented.,👏👏👏,Yes!!,Screw U,Awesome news!!!,Fu&$@ing stupid to mandate…wow!?,OMG... Discrimination at it's worst. Do not do it. This is not what an institution of education has a right to do. Stand down. Are you a bunch of bigots now? What a disgrace.,Excellent!,Jenni Schreiner,The best choice.,👏👏👏,Thank you!,Yay!!! Thank you!!! 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽,Great news!!!
Happy #NationalDogDay! If you haven’t already::: go get vaccinated! 🐶💉 • #UofU #universityofutah,2021-08-26 19:02:54,Kinder Boc,Oh cool! Linking getting vaccinated to a national dog day post 😐👍🏼,I didn’t know I can vaccinate my dog now too.

It changed from a nice post to trash in three words that weren’t necessary
Hope everyone’s having a great first week of school!  For the health of our community and a successful semester::: we ask that masks be worn indoors and in settings where physical distancing is difficult to maintain. 😷 • #MaskUpUtah #UofU #universityofutah,2021-08-25 21:14:46,I was the head of the immunization clinic at the Air National Guard located at the Salt Lake City airport. I gave shots to all the Pilots::: aircrew and all other members who flew around the world. They had all sorts of vaccines for all the world’s diseases::: and hardly anyone ever got ill because of the vaccines. Those vaccines work and protected the Air National Guard from all those worldwide diseases. The masks are necessary to protect also.,Thank you for continuing to encourage this to keep the students and staff healthy!,Unfortunate….Ma sks are such a false sense of security.,"Yeah great first week the U's hospital is at capacity::: we're seeing that COVID rates are going up across the country to unprecedented levels like in Mississippi. And the University's answer is to tell people to wear a mask as they pack it's students into classrooms. And not even responsibly might I add the classroom my class was scheduled for initially was small::: but thanks to the flood we got moved to a bigger room. Which means there was a bigger room they could have used in the first place to schedule the class they just chose not to do so::: which I assume is laziness on the administration' s part to exercise due diligence in taking this virus seriously. The message here should be say ""we still have remote options here::: thanks for making a difference:::"" because clearly we can get our work done remotely as proven by this past year you just have to provide the infrastructure to actually keep your students safe. Or you can pretend to care with this bullshit::: which is just you guys saving your ass and abiding by the dumbass Utah law that is mandating 75% of classes must be in person::: despite that being Unconstitutiona l as it literally goes against the Preamble of the Constitution.",So glad I don't go here anymore.,So football games….?,I would like you pro maskers to show me one confirmed case where a mask has prevented someone from getting COVID or has saved at least one person’s life.,Can my kids go to u of u as elementary school kids since they are all vaccinated and wearing masks??? How are we not protecting the unvaccinated kids??!?,Thought this was interesting for an airline::: regardless if you are pro mask or not.  https:// www.google.com/ amp/s/ simpleflying.com / finnair-bans-clo th-masks/amp/,🙄,Then put a mask mandate in place. There is no way students will comply unless required.,If I'm vaccinated (which i am)::: i couldn't care less if you wear a mask or not lol,Ugh my son sent a picture only a few people are wearing masks and the classes are full.🥲 wish they were wearing masks 😷,Congrats.. so does BYU.. BOO Gop COX rump supporter!!!,Thanks for encouraging the protection of our collective health,Funny quit picking your nose,The University of Utah: Does that include at next week’s football game? Thanks! 😷,Nathaniel Evans,♥️,😷,You guys are beyond hypocritical. Don’t post this picture and not fight for a campus-wide mask mandate. You can’t have it both ways.,Scott Reynolds,Universities are too liberal to have rational thought and follow the science.. (not the science on cnn and from the cdc) but at least they keep raising tuition every year 😂,Nate Friedman::: interesting...I assume we can also have something like this on our site??,God bless Texas !,Maybe read the studies that show masks do nothing but give you a false sense of security,Aren’t the masks that everyone wears like 10% effective? Better off getting vaccinated.,GOOD ! ! !,Such a false sense of security! Just get the vaccine and move on without masks. The virus is going to morph just like the flu and we'll have a new vaccine variant every year. Enough with the masks already!,Cloth Masks are not considered Personal Protective Equipment per OSHA so this just makes you look stupid.,Keep a look out for these dummies.

It’s a landmark day as we announce an incredible gift of $110 million for the University of Utah School of Medicine from the George S. and Dolores Doré Eccles Foundation and the Nora Eccles Treadwell Foundation.  In honor of not only this gift::: but the lifetime of leadership::: vision and advocacy of Spencer F. Eccles::: chairman and CEO of the two foundations awarding the grant::: the school of medicine will now be known as the Spencer Fox Eccles School of Medicine.  “I have long believed that no state or region can become truly great without a world-class medical center at its nucleus:::” Mr. Eccles said. “We hope this seminal grant—the largest ever awarded by our foundations—will help ensure the university not only provides the highest quality medical education for the doctors who serve Utah and the entire Intermountain West::: but also furthers the excellence of health care for all our citizens and impacts the future of medicine through its groundbreaking research.”  Thank you::: Mr. Eccles and the entire Eccles family and foundations for this amazing contribution to the University of Utah and the entire community. 🙏,2021-06-09 17:17:44,What an awesome gift to the School of Medicine. Why does the name of school need to be changed? Didn't we already go through this with a gift from Sorenson in the late 80's. Then the gift was returned because no one wanted the name changed. Why now?,Thank you. Your contributions have been considerable and amazing.,My father donated his body to the school when he passed away. So proud of him,I'm very grateful for the gift::: but I can't get on board with renaming the school. It's a state medical school::: not a concert arena. Wouldn't a building or professorship named after them be enough?,Look at that diverse stage and crowd 🤣🤣🤣,Incredible gesture of support by an inspirational man. Go utes!,Wait::: I thought capitalists and entrepreneurs were the greedy 1%? I guess THAT narrative doesn't fit here.

Outside Milford::: Utah::: the FORGE geothermal well utilizes the 440-degree rock beds that lie deep within the earth and injected water to create energy. It's a research collaboration between our Energy and Geoscience Institute and the U.S. Department of Energy::: which is funding the $200 million project.  Although geothermal power is not a new concept::: it’s typically found only near natural geothermal systems::: like hot springs or volcanoes. What’s so unique about this work is accessibility.  The current project takes up a few acres of land::: and there are almost no limits to where it could be placed::: says principal investigator Joseph Moore::: making geothermal power a possibly more viable energy source.  📰 https://magazine.utah.edu/issues/summer-2021/heat-beneath-our-feet/,2021-05-26 22:39:08,Wouldn't wide spread use of this technology eventually cool the Earth's core and kill our planet?

We have all fallen short. All have sinned. Floyd served his time. He paid his debt to society. He did not deserve to be killed by law enforcement officers over a fake $20 bill. I was once given a fake bill in change from one store::: and it was detected at the next store where I made a purchase. I had no idea the bill was counterfeit. I’ve never gotten anything more serious than a traffic ticket. There is no way to tell if Floyd knew the bill was fake or not. If he did::: I doubt he would have remained near the establishment after he made his purchase for as long as he did.,Nice students you got here lmao,Amen.

Face coverings will continue to be required in all university-owned and -operated buildings. A decision about requiring masks in the fall will be made closer to the start of the 2021-22 academic year & will be based on public health guidance at that time.  ATTHEU.UTAH.EDU Face coverings still required on campus | @theU,2021-04-08 16:17:13,It's truly disheartening that you are posting a picture of students sitting outside::: in the fresh air::: masked.,I'll stay clear of any U owned facility! They're money hungry and have very poor communication doctors!,I applaud you for this. Thank you!,Good call. We aren't out of the woodwork just yet.,Great advice under the circumstances. :),And OOS students getting on a packed airplane touching strangers in seats next to you on a cross country flight is now safe too. 🙄,Lol,🙄,Thank you for this! 🙌🏼,Good decision,Thank you!,Just stupid.,INVINCIBLE KILLER!  UBER connects more people and freely transfer covid unnoticed than any means of transportation globally.  UBER uses hybrid cars 70:::000 drivers every second that produces carbonmonoxide every now and then. Carbonmonoxide binds to haemoglobin irreversibly giving less chances to needed oxygen! If you live in London with lung diseases you are more likely to die from UBER's every second carbonmonoxide! While you have smoke detectors at homes to detect carbonmonoxide::: sadly nothing yet or polices to protect anyone on the streets! Chances of getting CV19 is higher with carbonmonoxide compromised lungs reason for daily new cases!.  UBER is a vile::: evil American company that rakes in billions of pounds from UK public each year::: claims no profits like Trump that paid $750 or AMAZON to return zero taxes for the last 9 years! UBER currently avoiding taxes is gravely pushing the UK economy into recession!  Rich party wins any election! PRIVATE DONORS controls law::: police and MPs!  Do people regularly monitor their BANK ACCOUNT balance after UBER rides or VOLATILE INCESSANT SURGE as UBER is vividly FRAUDULENT!  Today how many people are already infected and have been in UBER rides! UBER is a potent spreader of any diseases with active 70:::000 untested drivers every second!  In airtight or enclosure especially cold winter such in UBER::: you are more likely to exchange same air between untested asymptomatic drivers and riders increasing exponential chances of deadly CV19 sadly worse in explosive coughs or sneezes!  Pensioners that paid lots of taxes are first victims of pandemic::: while UBER with no taxes continue to spread the deadly CV19 to the public!  Amazon just like UBER profits in excess of 200 billion while UBER persistently avoid taxes. I do not support any transport outfit but solely advocate full payment of taxes from UBER! Full tax payments from UBER does not affect any driver but sadly UBER demands more commissions from these drivers that drivers have no choice but to avoid taxes too!  UBER should be questioned for the deaths of drivers both reported and unreported. UBER is a selfish and vile company that care less about vulnerable::: poor people that works hard to put food on tables. How many of these drivers are sick::: asymptomatic and continue to spread the virus working from international airport pick ups!  A close relation who has been on UBER ride with affected driver can infect you with no contact with UBER!!!::: contact tracing! If UBER drivers are going to be sitting in airtight::: zero social distance with the public::: then COVID19 tests is mandatory every 2 weeks with displayed proof to reduce or remove spread of deadly corona virus!!!  Kids meal and other public services in UK are currently under threat as UBER yield zero taxes while raking billions from the same UK public!  UBER services that yield zero taxes is useless to you or anyone and sadly pure evil! Currently UBER owes 1.5 Billion in VAT and 1 Billion in taxes!  UBER evil::: vile American company claims no profits just like Trump that pay $750!  This is solely awareness about air pollution::: CV19::: poor ethics and tax avoidance of UBER!

If you can::: carve out some time at noon tomorrow (Tues.::: April 6) for a conversation with alumnus Alex Smith sponsored by ASUU. 📺 https://youtu.be/lhkZFiBARTc  He'll talk about his time at the U::: his NFL career and of course the awe-inspiring comeback to the playing field after suffering a life-threatening leg injury.,2021-04-05 21:24:49,Only if he will listen when I tell him IT'S TIME TO RETIRE! He has put his family thru enough. As a Packers fan and a lifelong Ute I have been aware of him for EVER. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH 😁,I would like to speak to Alex. We have a very similiar comeback story from the same injury.,"What’s all of this world It's brain control. All political::: economic::: cultural::: scientific::: social life is directed by brain control::: no open systems::: only brain-control system. Every thing in dark is sinful. Changing body properties by particle beam irradiation::: then use different waves to activate various pre-made body::: then Get the needed flesh::: parts or whole. You are easily “possessed"" by others with Ubiquitous waves this world. Others can know your thoughts::: control your thoughts and behaviors. Humans only divide into good and bad::: the controlled people are good::: the controller are bad. No border::: no systems::: so some questions had answer::: China rules the world because it controlled brain controllers all of world. It is interesting that the West surrendered China::: because politicians are just for a little benefit. The western people are extremely miserable::: China's hereditary ""anthropophagy"" system was transplanted to the West::: Western flesh::: skills::: knowledge::: ideas::: temperament::: social status::: willpower…… are all “eaten”::: brain control technology can get everything of human by waves.  The characteristics of Brain-control Be only used by low essence people; Unlimited violence outside all laws::: get everything without paying: status::: woman::: wealth::: honor::: body face::: knowledge::: thinking .... All high and low boundary be broken::: All noble people be casily killed and raped by rogues; China has controlled Brain-control worldwide::: the rulers are only low essence people in the world; There are only controlled and controlling in the world::: without any system; China is controlling the earth with strict national power::: all things are false appearances; Brain control cannot be discussed by anyone; China will not make any good people alive::: the people will never be free::: all life wii be in dream with a computer.",Interesting.,Hollis in case you guys wanna watch 😊
U Remembers reflects on the historical effects of racial discrimination and invites us to make connections between the past and contemporary social issues.  diversity.utah.edu/u-remembers/  This year’s theme::: “Breaking the Silence:::” and events will aim to inspire our community to learn and become involved in combating the rise of antisemitism::: moving from bystanders to active participants in the work eliminating hate in all its forms.  DIVERSITY.UTAH.EDU U Remembers | Office for Equity and Diversity,2021-04-05 18:27:48,The most important thing now China and its U.S. powerful minions are using violence to make people of all countries understand and succumb to a Brain-control world without system::: spirit::: and morality.  We can only base on facts now Trump didn’t allow the people to struggle armedily. So he is also bad. He doesn’t use the army to catch bad political figures. We can only base on facts now. All powerful people of the US have surrendered to China::: all American good people will be killed soon. The American cultural::: technological::: economy and people’s body have been destroyed by China in the past 30 years. The US will be destroyed! The people must go to struggle armedily. (1/14/2021)  Only I know the truth about the US Because all Americans were killed in my body by China::: although many people have been watching me for decades::: but only I told about it to people. The American people don’t know about it yet::: so they don’t know how to do now::: when America is about to die! I tell you::: tell all people again today! (1/12/2021)  America after January 6 The people must kill counter-revolut ionary lawmakers::: judges::: medias::: and politicians across the US! They were all cultivated by China::: become to powerful people::: and they were all Chinese servants for killing American people. Can't allow American system machines that are controlled by China to destroy the US!  Undulating queues I saw that the Japanese naval soldiers are almost physically weak::: Although they still maintain a strong spiritual power. So their skills will not be very strong. And all things of Japan are this shortcomings! Because China has destroyed the health of all Japanese by brain control in decades. China indirectly destroyed Japan by American brain control. In fact::: only the United States has been completely ruled by China in west. Now::: more Chinese wave guns than the US army is pointing at every one in the US::: in other western countries people are not fully controlled by china. So countries needs to cut off the US controlling. So China's slave Biden is consolidating allies. Every country needs to resist China themselves. In every country::: the people need to resist Brain-control themselves! After all::: the world be determined by technologies. If can cut off the U.S. controlling on technologies so the country can win in the world. Undulating queues are already literary on Japanese warships  Saving the world must kill Liu dianyu In the past::: Liu dianyu only needed to say a word::: so he could castrate all western people. So because of Liu dianyu::: China has stolen all the technology::: money::: and the bodies of all the people in the West. All Western countries have been ruled by China::: and all civilization::: spirits::: system::: and arts have been destroyed! At the critical moment::: if Liu dianyu is not killed::: Trump and all the good people will not succeed!

“My undergraduate experience did pay off::: but I don’t think students should have to overcome the obstacles that I had to. What I love about the Women's Resource Center - University of Utah is that we’re trying to eliminate those kinds of barriers. We’re trying to make it so students don’t have to live off $8 for an entire winter break or sacrifice semesters of college because they are $400 short in paying their tuition. We are often able to help make their dreams and goals attainable through counseling services::: scholarships and other resources.” #HumansOfTheU  Read more about Catalina Cardona and her journey through higher ed at https://attheu.utah.edu/facultystaff/humans-of-the-u-catalina-cardona/ • #UofU #UniversityOfUtah,2021-03-11 19:00:20,A great place of support for learning.

Coyotes aren't even dangerous... unless you're a little dog. That deer isn't even likely to be in danger.,So??? Coyotes usually stick to small prey. Keep your pocket puppies inside you'll be fine.,I guess just make sure you don’t have small dogs outside.

If you drive south through central Utah on I-15 and look west somewhere around Fillmore::: you’ll see smooth hills and fields of black rock. The area is::: aptly::: named the Black Rock Desert. It may not look like much::: but you’re looking at some of Utah’s volcanoes.  A pair of earthquake sequences::: in September 2018 and April 2019::: focused scientists’ attention on the Black Rock Desert. The sequences::: which included the main quakes and their aftershocks::: were very different from the Magna earthquake that shook the Wasatch Front in 2020 and other Utah earthquakes. Earthquakes in the Black Rock Desert are rare and capturing the seismic recordings from these earthquakes provides a glimpse into the volcanic system of the Black Rock Desert that::: while not showing any signs of erupting::: is still active.

#COVID19 vaccinations are on the rise and cases are on the decline::: but with more contagious and possibly deadlier coronavirus variants emerging it is important to continue practicing public health measures in reducing the spread of this awful disease. Wear a mask. Maintain physical distancing. Wash your hands. If you're a #UofU student or staff::: get tested (it's free and available on campus). And if you are experiencing symptoms::: avoid contact with others and visit coronavirus.utah.edu for testing options.  These photos were taken at the COVID Medical Intensive Care Unit at University of Utah Health by Bryan Jones.

You sound like you are on drugs.,Thank you for working so hard to save lives. You’re all amazing humans. Thank you.,I won't take the vaccine because every reaction is different.

Each year we take a week to celebrate the educational access and opportunities that Dr. Martin Luther King’s legacy has provided in the United States.  This year's theme is “Good Trouble:::” a term often associated with former United States Representative John Lewis. As a founder and leader of the Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC)::: Lewis was the youngest person to speak at the March on Washington on August 28::: 1963::: and taught us young people must be the change they want to see by pushing and forcing older generations for equitable change.  “I want to see young people in America feel the spirit of the 1960s and find a way to get in the way. To find a way to get in trouble::: good trouble::: necessary trouble.”  Learn how you can get involved and the various #MLKWeekUofU events at diversity.utah.edu/mlk,2021-01-17 18:33:36

“The peaceful transfer of power is a hallmark of our democracy. What we are witnessing is not representative of the fundamental ideals that have shaped our nation and made us a model of governance throughout the world. As an institution of higher education::: we encourage vigorous debate and difference of opinion offered with respect; we support the rule of law; we believe in upholding our Constitution. We join those who condemn the unlawful acts that attempted to disrupt our democratic processes today.” -President Ruth Watkins  Pictured is the statue of Martha Hughes Cannon (of Utah)::: the first woman to be elected as a state senator in the U.S.::: which stands in the lobby of the U.S. Capitol. • #UofU #universityofutah,2021-01-07 05:42:20,We do not have encourage debate in most colleges. That is one of the problems inside and outside of schools. We allow a group of people to bully us until we submit or we strike back.,Proud to be a descendant of Martha Hughes Cannon. She ran against her husband and beat him::: becoming the first woman state senator in the US. She was also physician and specialized in treating women and children.,"Let's be clear about what happened at the Capitol. A bunch of thugs broke in and not only were planning to kill Mike Pence::: and other high-ranking officials::: but placed pipe bombs and trashed offices. This ""trashing"" included stealing sensitive files and both urinating and defecating. I hope they are all prosecuted and people wake up to what it means to align yourself with Trump. Shameful.",So many Haters .can't take it . He Lost . He should not be a President anyway .so many influence. Shameful for America.,The University of Utah Well stated!,We are not Seditionist.Tru mp must be impeached and removed from office.,🙌,So why didn’t you post this in 2016 🤷‍♂️,Thank you!

The strange world of #COVID19 conspiracy theories: https://attheu.utah.edu/facultystaff/the-strange-world-of-covid-19-conspiracy-theories/,2020-12-07 20:35:54,Couple things re: this article. 1. As soon as there is a difference of opinion or a questioning of the provided “facts”::: it is labeled a conspiracy theory in an effort to discredit other opinions or information. Interestingly - and something that proves this is the study referenced in the article about what people believe about the death of Osama Bin Laden. To my knowledge the US government has not::: to-date::: provided any tangible proof that he was killed by Navy Seals in Pakistan. Our government said xyz happened - without evidence::: and anything contrary is a “conspiracy”. 🤔 kinda like the daily circus regarding this year’s Presidential election.  2. The current reporting and emphasis by not only the media::: but the healthcare community at large is completely one-sided. The only information being provided to the general public re: Covid is the negative::: fear-inducing numbers. 283k deaths::: daily record death totals::: hospitals overwhelmed::: etc.  The facts are: based on reported numbers provided by Johns Hopkins - which is identified as the numbers to believe::: the current overall death rate from Covid is 1.9% as of today. That is not reported.  What is also rarely reported::: if at all::: is information on how to improve one’s health::: how to boost one’s immune system. The study showing the positive & preventative effects of Vitamin D::: was quickly pushed away. I’m sure we could stop by the Nutrition Dept. at the U and learn all about how Vitamin D & supplementation is a great immune system booster. Also how the vast majority of Americans are Vit D deficient which is an underlying factor in a lot of illness. In any other setting that information would be discussed as fact::: but in the current climate it’s thrown under “conspiracy theory”.  3. The forthcoming miracle vaccine: what has not been reported anywhere is the actual medical community::: health community::: research community agreed upon timeline for vaccine development. I can tell you it isn’t 6 months.  In a normal climate if researchers at the U or at any research institution were to try to develop a medication or vaccine in this short amount of time::: fast-tracking phase I::: phase II::: & phase III trials::: & without proper follow-up trials::: without proper peer-review - they wouldn’t be researchers for very long.  But this is unprecedented::: the virus is so dangerous::: so it’s ok to bypass proper protocols and procedures for the greater good - that’s the argument. Yet as pointed out in # 1::: overall it isn’t that dangerous::: 1.9% death rate.  The backbone of science is questioning and not believing things at face-value. But what we’re learning is if you question “authority” you are labeled a conspiracy theorist and attempts are made to discredit you.  Where have we heard of this before? Copernicus::: Galileo::: Bacon::: Unger::: Oldenburg::: Einstein::: & the list goes on. Without these early “conspiracy theorists” where would science be today?  I would hope the U can post::: publish::: provide more encompassing information of the current health situation as a whole::: and less biased::: one-sided information.,Having worked AT THE UNIVERSITY OF UTAH with NIH grants that were funded by the Gates Foundation::: it took me about 8 seconds to track the data path. The NIH grant was reinstated in the fall and should be readily available if anyone wants to read about it and how EcoHeath Alliance::: a GATES FOUNDATION entity is involved.,"""COVID-19 symptoms can sometimes persist for months. The virus can damage the lungs::: heart and brain::: which increases the risk of long-term health problems."" https:// www.mayoclinic.o rg/ diseases-conditi ons/ coronavirus/ in-depth/ coronavirus-long -term-effects/ art-20490351",This propoganda article needs to go viral so the world can see that the U is telling people how & what to think....smells like communism spewing forth from the University of Utah.,Tl;dr version: if you have any problem with your freedom being destroyed in a manner that makes the patriot act look like the bill of rights::: you're a conspiracy theorist and have mental issues.  Thanks for encouraging free thought lol::: glad I'm not going to university now.,Mitch Brinton,Ah the strange world of propaganda disguised as academics.,Imagine::: if you will::: a virus so pernicious you have to be tested to know you have it; with a vaccination so safe::: you have to be paid to take it.

Here are the student #COVID19 numbers for the asymptomatic testing period Nov. 11-24:  8:::994 students were tested 136 students tested positive 1.51% positivity rate,2020-11-25 23:35:06,Is this the antigen or the PCR test??,Does this include off campus students?,What about the people who tested positive only to be tested again and shown they are negative? Testing is not accurate.,That rate is significantly higher than the general population in Utah. How concerning is that?,What a joke and waste of resources. < 2% positivity,And how many local and campus students are there? Wondering how many might be out there that didn't test.,How many of those that tested positive showed any symptoms before or after?,What about the surveys I've been asked to fill out each week. Is that data public? What fraction of folks are reporting symptoms in the last week?,What was the rate of discrepancies between positive rapid antigen tests and pcr tests?,This comment section is making it very obvious who is the real cause of the spread 1. There's not a shortage of tests::: this was to prevent people from unknowingly bringing covid to their family. 2. This demographic of students wears masks and takes the virus seriously::: of course the numbers are going to be low. That's the point 🙃 3. If you think college parties are bad I'd advise paying attention to anti-masker super spreader events. Or maybe consider that people who are infected with it are forced to go out because they need money and our citizen services are a joke.,Great job Utes 🎉🎉 Happy Thanksgiving,So there’s 136 students on the football team?!,Story doesn't check out. The rest of Utah is around 20%  You lyin::: bruh,Are people wearing masks and distancing like they should?  Sadly it's probably spreading at parties 😕,If you listen to the news::: it’s at least 75%,Not bad considering the spread in Utah.,That’s pretty good considering other populations.,Wasted Time & Money: 100%,And how many were then required to give a spit test to ensure a positive or negative.,You made one of the top three in my child's lists of colleges::: but he will not be attending your establishment after reviewing some of Chris Nelson's comments and the fact that you would employ such an unhinged person as a spokesman.,Thanks for keeping us updated and for the transparency.,Does the number include the football team and basketball teams? I bet not.,How many were admitted to the hospital?,Nice. Let's Party!,Good point Tansy O'Brien. Stats need to be calculated across a window::: a time spectrum.,Yeah??

X771m-ZHbDt,So my next question is how much did this cost overall? I don’t think a 1.5 percent positivity rate is worth the hassle or cost.,Thank you for sharing this information,Excellent news,I am frustrated that we are using testing resources to test a population that will have very mild effects from Covid. Why aren’t we using these tests at the University Hospital to test healthcare workers on a regular basis? My understanding is that staff at the hospital is not required to do testing unless they have symptoms. It makes no sense to me that we are not using our testing ability to protect the very workers who are dedicating countless hours to help those most affected by Covid. Our healthcare workers should be tested before every shift. Let’s keep them healthy so they can help those less fortunate recover.,Such a waste. Good on you utah,Then there are the ones negative by school and retested and came back positive 2 days later,Keep up the hard work::: “U” students,This is great news. I would’ve guessed the percentage would’ve been much::: much higher.,Well done. Stay safe over the holiday.,Remove the scary word 'Corona'::: and what you have is an Upper Respiratory Infection... They would've been in the hospital anyway... Be Aware::: Not Paranoid... Mortality is low. Happy Thanksgiving! 🦃,Thank you U of U!,Good Job U of U,Wanda Losee
Virtual and outdoor get-togethers are the best ways to avoid the spread of COVID-19.

ATTHEU.UTAH.EDU Clearing the air at holiday gatherings | @theU,2020-11-25 19:41:39,Thanks for trying to inform people.

What's good for business? Wearing a mask.  A study by The Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute found that 51% of Utahns were more likely to shop at a store where everyone wore a mask.

Sars vaccinations,People do not prefer to wear masks. Just because you claim to have done a study doesn’t make it true. Many people choose to avoid stores because they don’t want to wear a mask. Publish these so called details of the study so the public can see how true they are! Details of a study will prove how legit it is. Most people are too scared to say how they really feel.,😂😂😂😂😂,I had a stroke a couple of weeks ago and went to the u They treated me with the upmost respect and they didn’t treat me bad for not wearing a mask they all did and I didn’t treat me bad for wearing a mask it’s called respect,Dee Wood,I don’t mind wearing one where mandated::: but... if they work at all::: why are cases up?,I’m Sure this was just as accurate as all of the election polls before the election.

Interestingly::: SLC case numbers rise at a much greater rate than neighboring cities in the 3 weeks following the debate. Knowing that incubation for COVID is up to 14 days::: this is significant because there was an influx of staff that came directly from Washington DC to SLC for the event.

We asked the Peace & Conflict Club at the U the following:  What would be some tips for having civil conversations with friends & family who may not agree politically?  Their answer ⬇️  ATTHEU.UTAH.EDU Election hopes and fears | @theU,2020-10-28 23:28:16,Here's a helpful article on the topic.  http:// huffp.st/9NKVFhC,"In any communication between people every person wants to be heard and have their opinions respected. Just listening to people and not taking a position for or against their opinions often wins the argument.  Often people take unwavering positions that they are not willing to abandon for any reason. Generally::: when that happens it's not about the position being argued::: but rather about some underlying emotions::: id level feelings that have been hard wired into their foundational subconscious minds that provide a sense of emotional security and stability for their being. Often those emotions are fear based that are supported by other negative emotions.  There's a saying something like::: ""A person forced against their will is of the same opinion still."" Psychological imbalances::: like any addiction::: must necessarily be acknowledged in one way or another before those addictions can be cured::: relieved. Until people make a choice to change their opinions they stay stuck with those opinions. So::: in effect the primary task is to get a willingness to change. Until that happens people won't budge.  If you really want to know where a person's head is::: in terms of their willingness to see and possibly agree to other contrary positions::: one option is to just get straight to the point and ask them::: "" Are you willing to consider another viewpoint on this (xyz) subject if you are shown additional facts that may be contrary to what you think."" The answer will inform you on how to proceed. :)"

I know how the U reviles and viscerally hates women::: students and staff. I wish I had had the courage to leave.,Job well done!! The U admitted their misteps and took action to rectify and work WITH the family to do better. No::: it will not bring back their daughter but the U’s actions and acknowledgment will bring them a little relief. Love and prayers to Lauren’s family. My daughter was just down the street when this happened. We think of Lauren and her family often.,In almost every other instance you could think of::: the institution would have announced an undisclosed settlement and everything would have been swept under the rug. It may not be perfect::: but it seems to be advancing towards improvement to me.,I hope it will bring needed change. Their daughter and our daughters deserve better.,A beautiful campus. Went there to play basketball. The country is amazing. Will always love the U.,I hope it includes the resignation of Ruth Watkins.

Golden hour 🍁 • #UofUfall #universityofutah #UofU,2020-10-20 00:34:57,Fall glory in full bloom!,The autumn♡,Beautiful,Beautiful photo. :),Used to go to the U.
The university is aware of the Facebook post by Hogle Zoo (including its most recent update). The university is working with the leadership of the chapter as well as representatives of the national Sigma Chi organization to investigate. We take these matters very seriously and are working to make sure those responsible are held accountable.,2020-10-19 19:07:04,Sounds like typical frat kids,Disappointed that Hogle Zoo took their orginal post down.,Terrible...make someone accountable...o r you can be like the Democrats and sweep this garbage under the rug...your choice,“Very serious” about what fraternities do. Sure.,The university shut down the last investigation of the fraternity after they donated $12 million to the medical school.,Disban the chapter.  I don’t know why frats exists in the first place. Now it’s become nothing more than a breeding ground for privileged people to purchase friends because they’re afraid of being lonely in college since most of them peaked in high school.  Also the consistent sexual abuse and date rape culture coming from fraternities is a no for me.,They need to leave the U for this. Behavior like this::: at this time::: is especially abhorrent. It shows how little they respect anything::: literally::: anything. Unfortunately::: they probably won’t because::: from the original Hogle Zoo post::: a particularly important family member was present whose family has been particularly helpful by providing millions of donation dollars. Let’s hope the U makes the right decision here.,As a former Greek member at the University of Utah::: I find it horrifying that in 2020::: we are still not only allowing fraternities and sororities::: but holding them up on golden pillars. I had some good experiences::: yes::: but I was wildly lucky that I didn’t have the typical experiences as my sisters. It promotes under age drinking::: drug use::: dangerous sex::: sexual assault::: sexual harassment::: and breaking all sorts of legal::: academic::: and moral rules. Tradition isn’t worth the damage frats and sororities have done.,Kick them out of school! They are a disappointment to Utah. I don't want their daddy's paying for their vandalism and not teaching them life lessons. They need to be arrested.,What happened?,Close the frat and ban those idiots from the U. They should also get jail time and pay fines.,I'm extremely disappointed in the behavior of these students,Kick them out and use the rest of their tuition as a donation to the zoo. Also::: get rid of the Greek system.,This school is not moving up to the expectation that they should. Probably nothing will happen to these kids!,In all the years of being so proud of MY SCHOOL::: THIS AND THE SHAMEFUL POLICE DEPARTMENT NOT PRESSING CHARGED OF THEFT OF EVIDENCE IS SERIOUSLY APPALLING 😡😡😡,This is not the first time Sigma Chi has vandalized property. I went to the U of U from 2008-2012 and I remember them getting in trouble back then too. I hope the chapter is closed because it seems like they don't take this stuff seriously.,Since they perpetrated these acts in public at a tax payer funded business::: I expect the punishment to be made public too. This can't be tolerated and must be a deterrent for others. We're watching U.,For those of us Alums far away::: what was the post?,let's be honest. these punks come from families with deep pockets. you will just wait for people to forget about it and things will go on like nothing happened,I hope these students are held accountable.,As an alumna::: it’s disappointing to see this kind of behavior associated with our alma mater.,How is it the University of Utah's fault?? People need to learn to take responsibility for their own actions::: stop blaming others!!,Spoiled little brats. Suspend the chapter and expel the perps.,all these students involved need to be kicked out of school period. My respect for the U is lost what a disgrace,These students need to be held accountable as they represent the University and Utes-so not ok,These individuals need to be charged with vandalism and threatening someone with a weapon. Their fraternity needs to be charged financially for the damages and maybe disbanded. So disgusting!,Hogle Zoo mentioned that there was drinking in their parking lot::: with a lot of evidence of that being left behind for the Zoo to clean up. I sure hope that they at least had the decency to have designated drivers for their rides home. Judging from their behavior at the Zoo::: I doubt it.  One more thing: the Zoo has struggled financially this year due to Covid. How dare they cause them other debts by not only vandalizing their Halloween displays but also forcing them to close early after threatening a Zoo employee with a switchblade. I hope that the Dean of Students at least kicks that particular student out of school. Threatening the zoo carousel worker with a knife is a pretty bad look for the U.,Embarrassed to be a Ute? Over this? That should have happened way back when Campus Police and U admin failed Lauren McCluskey. No one was murdered at the zoo.,What happened?,Expel the perpetrators and shut down their chapter. U of U is not looking good on the law enforcement front these days.,Probably just a peaceful protest....(sar casm) If you don't like Sigs just don't go to the Marriott Library::: The Huntsman Center or Cancer Institute and stay out of the Garff South Endzone when its rebuilt....Sigm a Chi will take care of it.,Expel them. There should be federal charges.,Suspended?? Maybe should be!! Spreading COVID19 too. Shameful,Such a disgrace to the U. For one::: the Zoo is right there and a popular and awesome place to go for just about anyone::: student::: family::: tourist. Second::: obviously not ready for college and real life. Don't know how to act then don't drink little punks. Go back home and be spoiled with your mommy and daddy.,It’s 2020::: can we just get rid of fraternities and sororities please? They’re so pointless and embarrassing. Shoutout to all the colleges that don’t have them.,Frat/Sorority houses should be examples and held to exemplary standards. I hope their are consequences and some serious community service giving back to Hogle Zoo. They could use some free labor now days.,Got privilege?,Just Utah students doing what they do. I'm sure they'll get a slap on the wrist and a new scholarship handed to them.,What a bunch of tools. Kick them out and close the chapter for a few years. They should have to pay for everything and do community service. 200 hours of cleaning the shit out of animal cages should suffice.,After the death of Lauren::: safety should be top priority!!!! KICK. THEM. OUT. OF. THE. SCHOOL! They pulled a KNIFE on someone!!! Obviouslt violent::: and enjoyed putting fear into people's hearts. At the zoo??? Yikes.,Sig Chi strikes again,Should have never happened!!,Close that chapter for the year or two!,I’m not ashamed to be a Ute::: I’m ashamed of the asshats who did this though!,Don’t sweep this under the rug. Those were adult men that acted like thugs and they should be treated accordingly. Make them pay for damages::: work to clean it up::: and boot them from the school.,embarrassed to be a ute.,What a bunch of knuckleheads. Hopefully they make things right and are punished accordingly. Being drunk is not an excuse for your actions. What a bunch of rookies that can’t hold their liquor. You guys should be a dry fraternity.,What happened?,What happened?,Thanks to the Fraternity::: today I hang my head in shame and am embarrassed to call myself a Ute.,Abolish Greek life. Consistent violence::: sexual abuse::: and disregard for others. Unacceptable.,I've never cared for fraternities or sororities. School isn't a social hour. Students' parents have had 18+ years to teach their children to be socialized::: civilized::: and to not act like little arseholes.  This could be attributed to poor upbringing and what happens when students aren't physically attending classes or being held accountable for their education.  My sister's daughter attends there and the discussion we had just two days ago about all the students partying instead of studying because they have nothing better to do was disturbing.  This is the fault of both the university and the state for disrupting education::: requiring on-line education for students not mature enough to manage their time or education::: being more concerned with over-inflating the covid numbers by fabricating the numbers by counting non-tested students as positive and then trusting them to self-quarantine (party time)::: and the university staff being hands off.  Everyone...pare nts::: fraternity leaders::: as well staff::: and students are all to blame in this.  How about the U of U do what they've been paid to do...TEACH!  I hope the zoo sues the fraternity as well as each and every individual involved and they are awarded a judgment against all of those lawless morons until the damages are paid in full.  Community service and jail time might teach them a lesson. All scholarships should be revoked and expulsion might be an option.  How proud their parents must be.,Extremely not okay. Every single act of an animal being harassed should be an animal assault/abuse charge. Including lude and violent acts in front of children. Every single person associated should be expelled. This frat is notorious for being awful. They need to go entirely. If the university doesn’t do so - they stand in support of blatant abuse. Abuse of privilege does not entitle leniency. It’s felony time. Not kidding. Unacceptable. This fraternity should be suspended indefinitely. Shame some people cared so much to be in it::: their predecessors suffer. Be ashamed of your children. I don’t know why the U is even having to discuss this. It’s a deal breaker. It’s not great to keep animals in captivity but a majority were bred in captivity and that is their home. Breaking in and destroying someone’s home is jail time - and your character as a human being is defined by how you treat the weakest of amongst us. Fools those idiots. If this doesn’t happen I recommend - urine samples (the sent out kind where it’ll test your enzymes for weeks) so they cannot even think about drinking or drugs or partying - because anyone who did that without having done those is a psychopath and needs evaluation not support from rich brothers giving them connections for being willing to be awful. All the proud dads who’s whole life was defined by how cool they were in frat life - thrown away by their own flesh and blood. Sure raising them right. If this is what this fraternity is producing - nothing but bad - shouldn’t we just take out the trash and save us some trouble?,Bunch of dirt bags! Kick them out of school and close the chapter... UofU don't just wait it out with pointless social media posts in hope people will move on and forget.

Beside the fact every bit of destruction should be paid for and fixed every one of your students/staff involved should be not only charged criminally but expelled from the school. If you don't expell them you are condoning it!

That even if an explorer is a huge part of the reason that you're here today::: so is racism::: slavery::: genocide::: and other atrocities? Just because someone did one thing that benefited you::: doesn't mean that it cancels all the wrongs that they also did. Selectively learning history by what makes you feel good isn't learning history at all.,For those who might think that Columbus was a virtuous adventurer::: they need to read Howard Zinn's book::: A PEOPLE'S HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. In the first chapter he details how Christopher Columbus treated the Indigenous peoples he encountered.  Many people have attacked Howard Zinn on multiple fronts for one reason or another::: but none have ever refuted his scholarship.  For convenience::: here below is a link to read his classic book online. :)  https:// documentcloud.ad obe.com/link/ track?uri=urn%3A aaid%3Ascds%3AU S%3A3d5eee09-21 b1-4213-ab53-bf 7b81179a22,Wow these comments. Thank you University of Utah!,Queue all the Karens and Kens who've just now decided that Columbus is their hero.🤮,Let’s talk about cancel culture. What is a missionaries purpose other than to cancel the cultures of non-believers. The facts are being laid bare::: much to the chagrin of those clinging to american exceptionalism::: an exceptionalism that fails to acknowledge the sacrifices and harsh living conditions::: and death rendered to native americans::: blacks::: hispanics::: and asians. This country owes a debt of gratitude to these very people that endured through war::: slavery::: forced labor and encampment. Happy Indigenous Peoples’ Day::: and may the ignorant come to learn both the good and bad of the founding of this::: not quite great yet::: country of ours.,Happy Columbus Day to all,Happy Book of Mormon people’s day.,Happy Columbus Day everyone. He was an incredible man who accomplished much during his very troubled life. Shame on the University of Utah and all of the regressive-prog ressive institutions which try so hard to twist history to a contorted goal.  If the U of U is so bent on erasing this day in honor of falsehoods attributed to him then it better recognize the atrocities inflicted by native Americans on their own kind.  You cannot dispise one and honor the other.,Now change the mascot and get rid of the drum and circle logo!,I miss my university so much,Happy Columbus Day. In honor of a brave and intrepid explorer who risked all and found the continent many of our ancestors emigrated to::: and built the greatest country on earth. Native American heritage day will be observed Nov. 27th and all month long.,Happy Indigenous Peoples Day. :)

My student sees this loud and clear. Not a good message.  One has only to look at college Covid surges happening with back-to-school to feel assured the same will happen again after a 2 week ""reset"" (whatever that means).  If you're sending students home until January starting at Thanksgiving to minimize autumn back-and-forth then what possibly can be the rationale for letting them loose in October?  I've heard of kids going back East::: to CA::: to AZ. Seriously?! Explain please.",Forgot the selfie. Lol.,This is so heavily advertised but no one seems to be able to get answers about how to get tickets. It’s ironic that a school is hosting this but prevents students from attending classes on campus. 🤔 The U claims to be for everyone but then donates millions of taxpayer money to BLM. Did they match that to organizations on the other end of the spectrum? Why is taxpayer money used to fund the U’s pet projects?

Such candidate suppression is unseemly for a university::: where inclusion should be the default position. Specifically::: I hope to see Spike Cohen of the Libertarian Party there. Thank you.,Spike Cohen needs to be in the debate. He will be on the ballot in November; the people need to hear about all of their options. #JoJorgensen2020,I thought universities we’re supposed to support free thinkers. This is clearly a case of suppressing the students ability to make an informed decision for themselves.

He’ll be on the ballot in all 50 states. Do you really want your students showing up to vote without being presented with a complete synopsis of this final exam?,"At least the League of Women Voters had all the candidates.

Ask yourself why there has been no third party on the debate stage since 1992 when Ross Perot ran? Because after Perot::: the CPD increased the threshold to 15% in the polls and then picked polls that EXCLUDED third party candidates. Stop playing a rigged game. For an academic institution::: you should be ashamed of yourself.,Why are you scared not allowing a third party candidate to debate.

In his interview::: Jason said the following:  “If ever there was a time to engage::: it is now. Research those running for office::: register to vote and turn in a ballot on or before Nov. 3. This is a crucial time to get a picture of the leadership qualities of the candidates.  Voters can get to know the candidates by writing them letters::: researching them::: watching the virtual townhalls and asking them hard questions. Find out who can help your family and who can impact the economy::: your job and your health” (Aguilar::: 2020).  By excluding candidates who do not subscribe to the two-party system from the debate you are hosting::: you are making it difficult for the students of your campus and fellow Utah citizens to “get to know their candidates”::: “get a picture of the leadership qualities of the candidates”::: and “engage”.

Stop the candidate and voter suppression! #VoteGold #LetHerSpeak,Chris Dennison,The University of Utah I would appreciate if you include Libertarian Presidential VP Candidate Spike Cohen in this debate. Spike is more than qualified::: and we are watching you assist in voter supression by ignoring so many Americans who #votegold https:// youtu.be/ lIO7HTxnKso,Invite Spike Cohen ! and let Jo Jorgensen in the presidential debates! #LetHerSpeak,Spike Cohen deserves to be on the stage. Him and Jo Jorgen Jorgensen will be on every ballot.,The University of Utah You should appeal to the debate commission to include Spike Cohen or refuse to have the debate. Otherwise you are actively participating in voter suppression. It's not enough to say you're for change::: you have to act. #spikethedebate,Logan Schmidt,Please include VP candidate Spike Cohen! He would be a great addition! We should hear from all sides and Spike is ready! Let's do this! #LetHerSpeak #JoJorgenson2020 #lethimspeak,What about #SpikeCohen  This smells like voter interference The University of Utah,We want a real presidential debate::: but Biden is too afraid to leave the basement::: so he sends Kamie to the battlefield (what a man!).,Really there are more than 2 VP candidates right now - can't include the Spike Cohen? He is on the ballot.,Spike Cohen should be a part of this debate. We won’t be truly free until we can actually vote for someone who represents our ideals::: not extremist career politicians  I’m voting for Dr. Jo Jorgensen! 💜💛💜💛  #DrJo #JoJo2020 #imwithher #sheswithus #votegold #jojorgensen #jonotjoe #goldrush #1gold #letherspeak #letherdebate #votelikeyourlif edependsonit #novictimnocrime #election2020 #powertothepeopl e https:// jo20.com/  #saveourchildren,Remember when it was determined that our government represented everyone and that it could exclude certain groups of people (blacks::: gay::: etc.).

His supporters want to hear from him. The rest of America needs to hear his message. #LetHerSpeak #VoteGold2020 #JoJorgenson2020,This pisses me off. The fact that people are making money off of incarcerated humans in the first place... plus verifiable evidence that Harris and Biden are directly tied to the continued production of this system. WE DEMAND THIRD PARTIES WITH BALLOT ACCESS ARE ALLOWED TO DEBATE,So Spike Cohen::: the libertarian candidate isn’t invited. Way to represent all of the voices out there.

Stop suppressing third party votes!!!! Let Spike Cohen speak at the vice presidential debates!!!!,#letspikespeak #SpikeCohen End the blatant voter suppression. Include all candidates that are represented on all 50 ballots. This is reprehensible. Utah State University should be ashamed.

If all nominees were actually permitted to participate. Instead::: you only have Dems vs. GOP. There are other options! Why aren't these other nominees allowed on the stage? #VoterSuppressio n,Please include Spike Cohen::: otherwise this is voter suppression.,Include Vice President nominee Spike Cohen! He’s on the ballot in all 50 states. #JoJorgensenForP resident,If #SpikeCohen isn't included then you're suppressing a growing bloc of voters. So your university has a choice. Freedom or authoritarian? Stand up for something by allowing a third (or fourth::: bring the Green Party in too) voice::: or allow this incivility to continue?  Your move.,Let Spike Speak! Let him Debate,Here's an educational video describing the background on why the University of Utah is participating in suppressing the vote. It's not hard to figure out given they're benefitting from the student debt crisis that both the Republicans and Democrats are complicit in creating. https:// youtu.be/ OW63M7zDy58,Daniel Lee Himes,Daniel Lee Himes,Here in UTAH we shouldn't permit the same corruption that permeates D.C. #SpikeCohen must be included in the VP debate if we have any shred of integrity. #SpikeTheDebate,"We can learn a lot about voting for the lesser of 2 evils::: such as no matter who wins you still end up with evil. This has no benefit to the American people.  If people actually voted for who they think the best candidate is we would have a very different system. The problem is that people continue a mantra of flawed logic such as ""3rd parties can't win"" which is based on circular logic followed up by ""it's a wasted vote"" which goes back to the can't win circular logic fallacy. Another logically flawed remark is that ""a vote for 3rd party is a vote for my least preferred candidate"". This statement makes a lot of assumptions on who others might vote for and while it may hold some truth to the individual saying it::: it is not true of all votes that go towards a 3rd party.  That being said all parties that are eligible for 270 or more electoral votes need to be included in the debates.",Stop silencing third parties and allow Spike Cohen to debate too. #LetHerSpeak #jorgensencohen2 020,Without the Libertarian and Green nominees::: this will be merely the usual content-free exchange of pre-written soundbites.

Why not let Spike Cohen into the VP debate too?,Daniel Lee Himes,They need to let Spike speak!,Spike Cohen is in the running as well. Why is The University of Utah partaking in voter suppression? By not including all options::: you are inherently coercing voters into only selecting one of 2 choices::: when they have another option. Coercion is punishable by fine::: up to one year in prison or both.

Please have mercy on innocent little animals. Please eliminate cruel laboratory experiments on innocent little animals. This is because animals are sentient beings who could feel pain and panic like you and I. And because animals are NOT for ours to eat::: to wear::: to experiment or to abuse.  If you really need some live-beings for laboratory experiments::: you may want to consider certain brazen criminal Chinese invaders who have been colluding with criminal Negro rioters struggling criminal black power and evil fortune by means of ID-fraud::: rape::: sexual exploitation::: abuse and violence. Because they can deny existence to make existence does not exit.  For example::: there have been some very brazen criminal Chinese invaders claiming they were narcotics police as they were sexually seducing woman with illusory drug & illicit drug with an attempt to rape as their method to struggle criminal black power & evil fortune. For another example::: there have been some very brazen criminal Chinese invaders insisting they did nothing wrong as they were perpetrating harassments & riots.  Therefore::: I think only those brazen criminal Chinese invaders are justified to be placed in laboratory experiments because these heinous criminals can deny existence to make existence does not exist. Thank you!  Very Truly Yours::: Miss Nancy Min Ji August 5::: 2020

Here’s a look at the new Kahlert Village::: set to welcome its inaugural class of residents this fall semester. Tomorrow (7/29) at 3p::: we’ll have a Q&A with a University of Utah Housing & Residential Education adviser to discuss the changes put in place due to the COVID-19 pandemic.,2020-07-29 03:16:36,Kari,What a beautiful mass graveyard!,Will the campus gym be reopening?,And here I thought Austin Hall was nice....

Fall Semester schedule UPDATE: We are extending online-only classes for an extra week this fall to reduce possible COVID-19 infections on campus. The online-only course period will be from September 28 to October 9.  In general::: we are focused on preserving the on-campus college experience for first-year students and ensuring that seniors can complete their graduation requirements. A majority of classes will be delivered online::: with exceptions for experiential learning courses::: including fine arts studio classes; practicums and clinical rotations; and laboratory instruction.  ATTHEU.UTAH.EDU Fall semester schedule changes due to COVID-19 | @theU,2020-07-28 16:56:50,"When my student registered for classes a few weeks ago the classes were a mix of on-line & some in-person. Now all of her classes are on-line. As I understand it even after the mid-semester “break"" to all on-line for the VP debate - all of her classes will remain online for the balance of the semester. Basically no in person classes. We are coming from out of state & she is slated to live in the dorms. Questions - What is the value of coming to campus and living in the dorms if all classes are online? Housing is now past the cancel date - will the U be extending this? If there is not reason for kids to be on campus (they can do classes from home) wouldn't it be better to encourage out of state/out of SLC area students to stay home? We need more definitive answers and reasons for decisions - and quickly.",If my student's classes are all online::: which we just found out they are::: does he need to return to campus at all this semester?,That God my daughter won’t be going until Fall 2021. She will be a freshman than and hoping everything is back to normal.,"I think it would be useful to hear from these epidemiologists how exactly this makes a difference. This is what it looks like to me... -Students will go back to campus for 5 weeks::: which is long enough for isolated cases to spread uncontrolled through the entire campus. (Maybe this 2 week break is just like Spring Break 2.0 where the U will cancel all in-person classes again?) - Everyone shifts to online coursework for 2 weeks::: interrupting class schedules and exam preparations in order to artificially lower the number of cases on campus due to lower visibility and testing so the U can still host the VP debate. - Students return for 6.5-7 weeks::: trying to catch up on everything they undoubtedly fell behind on and preparing for all-online final exams. - Everyone gets sent home at Thanksgiving to spread any illnesses to their families but Utah and U of U numbers appear ""low again"".","The University of Utah : regarding ""a majority of classes will be delivered online"" Is it possible to determine NOW which classes are online and which are in person? There is zero ""on campus experience "" if everything is off limits and my kid is doing remote classes locked in his room. (would appreciate an answer on this ASAP)","""The university was already scheduled to shift to online coursework around the vice presidential debate::: which will take place at Kingsbury Hall on Oct. 7. ""  Why not get rid of the debate and continue to teach 30:::000 plus students?",They be smokin CRACK,So “fall break” has remote classes ?,Why about the library? Are we able to study in the library on fall semester?,Update on October 9th : we are extending online-only classes for the rest of the semester.,Why would this week of online be helpful? I’m not sure I understand how it’ll help. Is it just so people aren’t on campus near the VP debate so they don’t have the possibility of getting sick?,What about students who have asthma and can’t be on campus at all during the fall semester?,Can on campus housing students remain in their dorms during on line instruction time?,Trevor Slater,This is confusing - we have a first year student - does this mean we won’t be moving him in to his dorm until Oct and he will stay home and do online classes until then?,This is confusing

We are relieved by the federal government’s decision to rescind guidance that would have prohibited international students from studying at universities that move to online-only instruction this fall.  “We are delighted the rule was rescinded. It relieves a great cause of concern for our international students::: who are a vital part of the U community:::” said Dan Reed::: senior vice president for Academic Affairs.  Universities—like the University of Utah—planning a hybrid model of instruction this fall were worried that a sudden change in teaching plans during the coming semester would force international students to leave the country.,2020-07-14 21:07:18,Great !! Now let’s offer more in person or hybrid classes and not pay the same amount of tuition for on line classes which really miss the mark !,You goddamn asswipes acting like hybrid models are safe,Great news !!!,I’m sure the college/ university are relieved. We international students have to pay ridiculous amount of money to be able to attend a school. Sometimes our education is necessary abroad just to clarify before someone tell me to study in my country. Without us::: colleges and universities will go bankruptcy,Great news!

It is requisite that students wear masks::: correct? I do not understand how this could be enforced? Will students be asked to leave lectures if they do not have a mask::: or claim they can not wear it::: or simply will not? If you cannot ensure safety since there is no way to mandate social distancing (especially in laboratory classroom environments)::: or masks::: then how can I feel assured that attending classes in person is going to be safe?  I just hope that the U will very closely follow the advice of the state epidemiologist and keep in line with their own statements anticipating the current decisions they are making about returning to campus.  From the U's own guidelines about students on campus while Salt Lake is in orange phase::: ""students will not be on campus during this phase."" And alternatively::: In the extremely rare case in-person classes are approved and held::: classroom capacity is determined by classroom size and the ability to maintain a 6-foot space between the students.  From Dr. Dunn about the current state of coronavirus in Utah::: [We are]""quickly getting to a point where the only viable option to manage spread and deaths will be a complete shutdown.” and ""We need large-scale behavior change on the part of all Utahns to reverse this trend.""

Today we celebrate #Juneteenth::: which commemorates June 19::: 1865::: when Union forces marched into Galveston::: Texas and announced that the Civil War had ended and that the slaves of Texas were to be set free. Even though the Emancipation Proclamation had been declared two years prior::: and the Confederacy had surrendered two months beforehand::: it was on June 19::: 1865 that the Union presence was strong enough in Texas—the most remote Confederate state—to enforce the Emancipation Proclamation.  In our graphic is the mythical Sankofa Bird::: which is also integrated in the Black Cultural Center - University of Utah logo. The word Sankofa comes from the Akan people of Ghana and means to “to go back to the past and bring forward which is useful:::” which is symbolized by the Sankofa Bird twisting back and retrieving an egg to bring forth. The Sankofa Bird was found depicted on a coffin during the excavation of a cemetery used for free and enslaved people of African descent in the 17th & 18th centuries. The site is now home to the African Burial Grounds National Monument in Lower Manhattan::: New York.,2020-06-19 16:13:37,https:// mavenroundtable. io/ theintellectuali st/news/ make-no-mistake- trump-is-test-r unning-fascism- to-see-what-he- can-get-away-wi th-wctZF6LDGUyU adCvapbUXg#utm_ source=SP&utm_m edium=SP&utm_ca mpaign=SP&utm_t erm=SP&utm_cont ent=SP,Happy Juneteenth::: which is part of American history. :),How about you celebrate by recognizing it as an official University Holiday?,Thank you.

Identify the socioeconomic factors of raising and spending the ""research"" budgets. One agency I worked with had BAKE SALES to raise money for their studies. I worked with NIH money exclusively for 10 years and then moved out to the departments. It was an honor to work at the U and participate in the research administration.",Awesome initiative.

Professor William Smith (pictured with wife Paula Smith::: also a U professor) coined the term “racial battle fatigue” and has written extensively about microaggression experienced by black faculty & students at historically white college campuses.  Smith is a proponent of a program that preps and educates incoming students about how to be change agents in developing a healthy campus climate and bolstering educational success.  “We have to prepare these students with the idea of becoming global citizens who value diversity and are able to recognize when microaggressions are part of the student experience and will work to ameliorate them regardless of the group targeted. We can’t wait for these incidents to happen. We have to be at the forefront of working to prevent them and::: when they do happen::: understanding how we intervene and how we restore health.”  Learn more at https://attheu.utah.edu/facultystaff/understanding-racial-battle-fatigue/,2020-06-08 21:03:23,That’s DR./Professor (and my Soror!) Paula Smith,Dr. Smith was my,"The college experience is a reflection::: overall::: of the societal environment from which students come to college campuses::: and to which they identify with during their college experience::: and to which they will return once they finalize their college education. In a diverse college environment one should expect that their college experience will mirror their lives of that of the general society.  African-America n students on HBCU (Historically Black Colleges and Universities) campuses also have their challenges. They were never established to excel predominantly so-called white colleges and universities such as Harvard University and other Ivy League schools::: etcetera. When you look at and study the creation of HBCU schools it is striking that their charters::: by and large::: were::: and are designed to educate African-America n students to be useful citizens ""in their place"" of subservience to the general society.  The pressures to conform to social models of ""acceptable behavior and citizenship"" for African-America n students are also prevalent on HBCU campuses just as they are on predominantly ""white"" college campuses.  Social stratification of socioeconomic and ethnic groups is a reality in the general society::: and college campuses::: for the most part::: mirror that reality. For change agents on college campuses having a solid::: clear vision of what change is the target is critical for overcoming the micro-aggressio ns::: frustrations and problems that African-America n students face. :)",When I was a student at the University of Utah from 1972 to 1974 there were about 76 African-America n students attending there out of a total student population of 23:::000. In contrast::: there were 95 Iranian students attending. And::: oddly enough::: I found the Iranian students to be extremely helpful in my support network on campus.  To my knowledge there were only two African-America n students majoring in Philosophy::: myself and one other female student. As we got close to fulfilling our graduation requirements within the Philosophy Department we both received intense pressure from certain faculty heads who put roadblocks in our path to graduation.  The other African-America n female Philosophy student decided that she wasn't going to deal with the negative pressure and discouragement coming from certain Philosophy Department faculty::: and she changed her major from Philosophy to English and one other major::: which I don't recall. I tried to talk her out of it::: i.e.::: the major change::: but she told me that the emotional and psychological stress was more than she could handle.  Many::: if not most students::: regardless of ethnicity or background::: may receive negative pressures from college faculty and students during their college experience. The most important thing that I found in successfully navigating a successful college experience is having a support network of friends::: faculty and organizational resources such as the Black Student Union at the time::: to successfully deal with the negative stressors of the college experience. For example::: without creating political conflicts within the Philosophy Department I sought out faculty within the Philosophy Department that I could depend upon for emotional and academic support::: which proved to be extremely helpful.  Before I started the college undergraduate experience I was counseled to be aware that there would be challenges coming from many directions in being an anonymous person in a community of thousands of unknown people. And::: that having a support system and network was critical for all students::: especially on large college campuses of many thousands of students.  Overall::: my experience at the University of Utah was one I cherish. I graduated with academic honors with a Bachelor's of Science in Philosophy. And::: I am thankful to all those students faculty and campus community organizations in which I found support and comradery. :),Thanks so much for your effort in fostering unity. The pedagogic creed is that when unity::: irrespective of race::: is practised::: the oneness and love we clamour for shall be epiphanized.,Thank you! I hope the university will share this training with faculty too ... I really do want everyone in my class and research team to feel like they belong here and to truly enjoy their educational adventure.,"As an Irish descendant from the families that dealt with slavery and rejection in the days when our accents gave us away::: you do know that this ""fatigue "" is passed genetically thru many generations to follow.

Dear campus community:::  The anger::: hurt::: fear and frustration that so many members of our community are feeling—especially our black students::: staff and faculty—is profound. George Floyd’s name must now be added to those of others who’ve been victims of systemic oppression and violence: Ahmaud Arbery::: Breonna Taylor::: Eric Garner and Michael Brown::: to name just a few.  Their deaths::: along with far too many others::: have most visibly exposed our society’s deeply rooted racism::: inequities and white supremacy. In recent days::: this painful fact has drawn tens of thousands of people together in peaceful solidarity::: including here in Salt Lake City::: to demand accountability and change. The power of this moment is diminished::: as so eloquently stated on Saturday by Utah leaders::: when peaceful protest turns violent.  As the flagship university::: the University of Utah is positioned to support state leaders in their efforts to shape criminal justice reform::: promote social justice and equity::: and address pervasive racism. This spring::: we began a series of campus conversations designed to bring community leaders and scholarly experts together in search of understanding and solutions to racism::: oppression and hatred. That work will continue with renewed vigor and intensity.  We are committed to equity::: diversity and inclusion at the University of Utah and are steadily progressing in our efforts to make this historically white institution more representative of and responsive to the diverse communities we serve.  We join Pastor France Davis and state lawmakers Sandra Hollins::: Angela Romero::: Karen Kwan::: Mark Wheatley::: Luz Escamilla and Jani Iwamoto in urging Utahns to make their voices heard peacefully::: respectfully and safely—important as the health and well-being of our community continues to be compromised by coronavirus::: which also has underscored the deep inequities in our society.  Our ability to support and help one another is challenging right now given that physical distancing is a necessity. Our campus resources remain open and available for those who need someone to talk to at this time.

You will never be taken seriously as an inclusive institution until you change this glaring racism.,Shitpost.,Maybe instead of applying a blanket solution you think might help::: ask your black students and alum what you can actionably do to help. Our perception is skewed by our experience so this may not be what is needed. Continue your quest::: as a university::: for knowledge and act accordingly.,You guys gave a Nazi a platform to spit hate. You didn’t care about POC then. Why would anyone believe you now?,If you want to make a difference recruit some lower income kids from economically depressed places to the U. Imagine taking 10 kids a semester from a place like the south side of Chicago and providing them with scholarships::: counselors and everything they need to succeed.,Thank you for that reasoned statement. When the violence and destruction stops healing::: building::: and structural change begins. :),Remember that time yall did fuck all about the Nazi shit that got put up around campus? I loved my dept in college but the admin and university itself are full of bullshit platitudes.,Michael Brown WAS NOT A VICTIM!,Spoken by a white privileged person that is part of the problem instead of part of the solution. Talk is cheap. Education is the key and you are not helping those who best need help by pushing your status quo solutions and driving up & up the price of EDUCATION!!!,When you leave people with nothing to lose::: they have nothing to lose.,I’m a U of U student and a former airborne infantryman. What these cops are doing to people would have gotten me::: rightfully::: thrown in jail in a war zone. We aren’t giving our own citizens the same justice we give prisoners of war. And last night I saw armed men incite violence towards protestors and effectively be shielded by the police.  The Supreme Court has ruled in two separate cases that cops don’t have to understand the law to arrest you for their ignorant perceptions of the law::: and that cops have no obligation to protect you. In that regard::: they’re less professional law enforcement and more armed militia.  If the highest court in the land has determined that cops don’t work to serve and protect us::: and if cops can get away with murder by claiming ignorance::: then we need to redefine this relationship. Burn it down and start over.,Virginia Marquez Chavez. Maybe something for Abel. His experiences matter.,There is no violence in our first amendment. The framers knew the power of speech is more powerful than violent uprising. It is too easy to turn back a mob to ‘keep the peace’ and allow the media to report on a few bad actors. Peaceful protest and strong ideas are required topple the status quo.  “Returning hate for hate multiplies hate::: adding deeper darkness to a night already devoid of stars. Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that. Hate multiplies hate::: violence multiplies violence::: and toughness multiplies toughness in a descending spiral of destruction.”  —From “Strength to Love” Martin Luther King::: Jr. published in 1963.,While I don’t disagree with this message. What can we do so that those continued peaceful protests by the oppressed are heard? Colin Kaepernick attempted to peacefully bring about change & look what happened to him::: white majority in the NFL kicked him out & did their best to turn the issue into those who support his stance are disrespecting US veterans who fought for his::: and our rights to take that stance. The “civil rights” movement occurred how many decades ago and these groups are no closer to being equal to nor receiving the same rights or opportunities as their white counterparts.  How long should we expect them to remain peaceful when they are senselessly gunned down daily by government employees who are supposed to protect them?  I am proud of the U for the steps you have taken & continue to take to be more supportive and inclusive of these communities but to suggest that change will occur if a group remains peaceful is ignorant.  I do not condone violence::: destroying businesses::: or harming others::: period. But one has to understand where this is coming from & why this is occurring. For any white person to tell these groups to just remain peaceful and change will happen is going to fall on deaf ears.,Korey Taylor

Engineering professor Massood Tabib-Azar is developing a coronavirus sensor about the size of a quarter that works with a cellphone and can detect #COVID19 in 60 seconds.  ATTHEU.UTAH.EDU Portable::: reusable test for COVID-19 | @theU,2020-05-08 18:38:19,As a side note::: I went to the U main hospital administration office back in February to mention among other things they use health buses to test for COVID-19 and noted I was job looking. I was hoping to at least get a letter of reference to be used for a new job or maybe to be used to apply for partial scholarships. Now of course::: the U is using the buses for such purposes. I left my contact info and never heard from them.  Just yesterday I got some eye-glasses from the Moran Eye Center at the U and the lady said she was working with a new computer system so I could order my new glasses. I ask before they just rolled out the new computer system::: did they ask her for her opinion of what features the new system should include::: better yet the U should also ask customers through your workers to question them what feature should a new IT system be to help their purchasing experience. In all these questions::: the answers are no.  If we are to stop the COVID 19::: the U culture of not asking people and not encouraging people by way of letters or gift certificates to give their input needs to change. There might be a homeless person who used to work in production may have had a great idea to increase production::: though was never asked. If the U encouraged even the homeless to give ideas in return be awarded::: you might be surprised of the results.  There is a quote by Einstein that says something like this::: it was our old way of thinking that got us here::: we change our thinking we change our results. So please::: University of Utah::: change how before you make any change or want to stop COVID 19::: rethink the culture of not encouraging input.  https:// www.flickr.com/ photos/ mysticpolitics/ 6246727670/in/ photostream/ lightbox/,Utah engineering leading the way once again......

This picture was from the 1961 season (my Freshman year at Purdue - Class of 1965!).,Was there when John Elway came to town. Was also there for every home game Rod Woodson played as a Boiler::: including his Iron Man game!! Great Memories::: Great Stadium!! #BoilerUp,Best place to be on a Saturday afternoon in the fall! #BoilerUp,Sat in those stands many times when our daughter attended Purdue.

!!!!",GREAT PLACE. Spent a lot of time watching games. Spent more time ushering when Coach Alexander was in charge of the ushers. Wouldn't trade it for anything,Dad would take us to Purdue as kids and pretty much left us to roam the campus while he went to the game. Looking back::: I’m grateful that we are here to tell the stories. Eventually we made our way to the stadium to finagle our way in to the game. But the memories are thick. Wouldn’t trade it for the world.,Funny Story.....I worked in the press box in the early 80’s serving soft drinks on the 3rd level for Vans Catering::: who at that time catered the whole press box. I was able to watch some of the games for the most part and when I couldn’t watch I obviously was listening to the PA announcer. For several years I heard this announcer say “Someone on the tackle”...... I would think to myself::: this guy needs to know who the players are......fast forward to 84 and I’m looking through the program and the roster.....low and behold I come across LB Kevin “Sumlin” and it hit me😂😂😂😂😂. “Sumlin on the tackle” 🤭,Tony J Romano,I spent many a Saturday watching our team when I was at Purdue in the mid 70's. When will the stadium become a complete bowl::: any plans?,Even though I enjoyed my time at Purdue in Ross Ade stadium::: it’s sorely in need of an upgrade. Maybe nicer facilities would also help with recruiting. Time for turf instead of grass?,"Been attending ( off n on ) since 1980 !

"“When you are in the classroom learning together::: it goes beyond your skin color. When you walk out of that room after taking the same exam::: you realize that you are equals. You can learn and develop together. You can’t let anybody ever take that away from you.”

--Adrienne White-Faines::: daughter of Winifred Parker White

Adrienne’s mother Winifred Parker White understood this message at her core back in 1946 when she and her sister Frieda Parker led the successful campaign to integrate Purdue student housing. Winifred and Frieda were civil rights trailblazers::: and their commitment to standing up for what was right makes them Boilermakers in every sense of the word.

It was a historic day at #PurdueUniversity as we named the Frieda and Winifred Parker Residence Halls in honor of the Parker sisters who integrated our dorms in 1947::: two of the first African-American women to live on campus. https://purdue.university/3vvMIhE,10/3/2021 20:16,"A little more information from Frieda's obit: ""In 1950::: Frieda graduated from Purdue University with a B.S. in Home Economics. Frieda immediately went into teaching. Frieda's entire career was in education. Following a temporary placement in Tucson::: Arizona::: Frieda embarked on a teaching career in Milwaukee::: Wisconsin::: where she was one of the founding organizers of the Teachers Union in the Milwaukee Public School System. Frieda worked for more than 50 years in the Milwaukee Public Schools::: the Milwaukee Area Technical College::: V.E Carter Development Center::: and various other community entities. In addition to teaching high school students::: Frieda supervised student teachers::: coordinated child development and day care programs::: as well as created and implemented ""School to Work"" programs for the Milwaukee Public Schools.

Frieda has always generously shared her talents with family and friends; there is no way to recount here the full extent of Frieda's decades of contributions to her community and the positive impact she has made on those with whom she has come into contact. After officially retiring from education::: Frieda remained active in several community and national organizations including the NAACP::: Delta Sigma Theta Sorority::: the Milwaukee Links::: Jack and Jill and the Purdue University Black Alumni Association.

"Check out a #Purdue record for the whitest paint in the latest edition of “Guinness World Records.” https://purdue.university/3hEe3de

And make sure to listen to #ThisIsPurdue where we hear professor Xiulin Ruan speak about the persistent pursuit of creating the whitest white paint. https://purdue.university/2TCCAXz",9/17/2021 17:00,"Breaking a world record wasn’t the goal of the researchers::: Curbing global warming was.
“When we started this project about seven years ago::: we had saving energy and fighting climate change in mind:::” said Xiulin Ruan::: the professor of mechanical engineering at Purdue::: said in a statement. The idea was to make a paint that would reflect sunlight away from a buildings. Making this paint really reflective::: however::: also made it really white. The paint reflects 98.1% of solar radiation while also emitting infrared heat.

Using this new paint to cover a roof area of about 1:::000 square feet could result in a cooling power of 10 kilowatts. “That’s more powerful than the air conditioners used by most houses:::” Ruan said.

Typical commercial white paint gets warmer rather than cooler. Paints on the market that are designed to reject heat reflect only 80% to 90% of sunlight and can’t make surfaces cooler than their surroundings.","One does need ground to be hot so that air is heated from below to cause convection and reduce air pollution::: create convectional rain::: etc. But this invention could allow for massive water-efficient
greenhouses in deserts. When dry air is cooled the relative humidity increases and the vapour pressure deficit improves so that plants can grow better. The cool white paint could reduce air temperatures in greenhouses in the United Arab Emirates::: etc. With a little evaporative cooling in the greenhouse with white walls food could be grown cheaply. The vapour pressure deficit should usually be less than about 1.2 kPa and this white paint could help a lot.

Example: Desert air has air temperature of 45 deg C with relative humidity of 15% and atmospheric pressure is 100 kPa.
This air is cooled in the white greenhouse to 35 deg C and therefore the relative humidity becomes 25.572%.
If the greenhouse has volume of 1000 cubic metres and 4.51 kg of water is evaporated for evaporative cooling the final temperature will be 25.50 deg C. This represents evaporative cooling of efficiency of 65.70% (65.70% of the way down to the wet bulb temperature).
The final relative humidity is then 63.34% and the vapour pressure deficit has fallen from 4.188 kPa just before evaporative cooling to 1.196 kPa::: which is suitable.",Love it ❤❤❤,"Congratulations

"On the morning of Sept. 11::: 2001::: Purdue alumna Heather Penney took off in an unarmed F-16 fighter plane intending to crash into the hijacked United Flight 93 and prevent it from reaching Washington::: D.C. She did not reach the airliner in time to sacrifice her own life::: but the flight’s passengers did so when they fought back against the terrorists::: forcing the plane down in the Pennsylvania countryside.

Penney frequently relives that day’s tragic events in public speaking engagements. By spotlighting the heroism of the everyday Americans on Flight 93 who undermined the hijackers::: saving their nation from further devastation::: Penney encourages audiences to honor the passengers’ legacy by being their better selves every day.

84 Purdue students face disciplinary action for failing twice to comply with required COVID-19 test",9/10/2021 12:10,Good for Purdue. I hope universities everywhere follow this model. Students::: staff::: and the community deserve to be protected.,It's important to keep people accountable to that which they promised they would do. The requirement in exchange for attending in person was vaccinating or frequent testing.,I am glad Purdue is trying to do the right thing. Peace.,The idiotic comments on this post have my head spinning! Kids learn selfish behavior from their parents. If you don’t agree with the university keeping their students and staff safe then send your kids to another school!,My Boiler has REPEATEDLY provided his proof of vaccination (vaccinated off campus the very first day it was offered in March::: second dose four weeks later). He is continually getting emails and phone calls telling him he is out of compliance. Each time he provides his proof and each time it doesn't get recorded. So::: I question the count of 700 students.,So incredibly disappointed in my Alma Mater. Standing with those 84 students and their right to make their own medical choices.,"If you are worried....get the vaccine! If you are not::: don't. Its still a free country and there have been people NOT getting vaccines since the beginning of vaccines. How many times have we heard the vaccine will protect you regardless of the variant? Are we trying to protect the people who got the vaccine from the unvaccinated? Doesn't that defeat the whole idea of getting the vaccine? It doesn't pass the logic test. (I am fully vaccinated and not an anti vaxer but believe its still an individual decision......m
y body::: my choice right?)",Thank you Purdue for allowing options! The majority of 55k people on campus are compliant of the Purdue Pledge agreement!,"Purdue University-this
is an embarrassing post. Stay in your lane and focus on education and positive energy instead of having people prove they are healthy.",This makes me proud to be an alumni! Keep our students safe and get them tested!,WOW!!! That’s called Discipline… Caring about others… Good to hear that college management is Serious snd Strict about implementing COVID-19 guidelines and Protect Purdue!!! 👍🏼,The article also mentions that 214 Purdue employees are also in violation.,Disciplinary steps for exercising choice: a sad day for Purdue!!,As an employee that got a written reprimand for not showing up for a test::: these students need to make absolutely sure that they received the email telling them to make an appointment. If they didn't::: then they need to fight it like I did. If you don't receive the email how are you supposed to know to schedule your test? This was a campus wide issue with employees::: I imagine it happened to some of the students too. Between myself and my supervisor my reprimand should be rescinded.,"The word ""Surveillance"" gives me creepy shivers.","Complete bullshit. Purdue needs to re-evaluate their purpose.....edu
cate our future leaders::: not turn them into sheep.","Non-compliance => consequences
A good life skill.",Doesn’t sound much like college to me. Very sad that this is their experience…,The choices made have consequences. They made their decision and now they have to deal with the consequence.,Concerned about 84 students::: hmm?,"Part of the university experience is learning how to behave as a responsible adult and accepting the consequences of your actions/
inactions. Sounds like 84 students are about to learn that the hard way.",They should bring toilet paper to the disciplinary board,No reason to test asymptotic person for any condition::: unless by choice. It’s always been that way::: or do you not remember?,"They should have required vaccination to attend the university - and drop the regular testing. They already have vaccination requirements - for measles::: chicken pox::: and others.

Forget this soft efforts not to offend anyone - just require the vaccine and be done with it.",84 Students are the focus of the article when it mentions 214 staff out of compliance....,mandate vaccines. spare the $ of testing.,Glad my son is done there-what a police state…,"Some folks here have no idea what communism::: socialism::: and authoritarianis
m actually are and it shows. I wish people would care more about their neighbor than they care about trying to prove a flawed point.",So are they requiring tests for vaccinated students since they can still transmit?,This is college in America::: not communism! Leftist deep state agenda at it's finest right here.,I'm happy to donate to the 84 students who have stood their ground by from the nazi take over!,"""Me"" mindset FAIL...
This credo is not in line with the Purdue I know::: just like not mandating vaccinations.
With federal 💰 at stake::: that's about to change. 👍",If it was intentional::: then they don’t belong there.,I am pleasantly surprised it is only 84.,If there are rules and they fail to follow them::: then they suffer the consequences. Maybe they could find another school that aligns with their beliefs. Pretty simple.,If you agree to something and sign an agreement and fail to uphold that dont whine that you didnt know any better.,What has happened to intelligent life?! Students and alumni need to stand together to defeat this slippery slope. Did everyone at the packed football game pass a “so-called” Covid test? What an embarrassment! Also ditch the masks. They work as well as the vaccines!,"I am so proud President Daniels handled things the way he did. Given these young adults ""choices"". But it only takes a few to ruin it for eeryone else. Come on Boilers its not that hard to go get tested.","Wow! Shocked that Purdue is complying with UNCONSTITUTIONA
L BS mandates. Live and let live. It’s still a free country.",What if your an international student and your vaccination isnt from Pfizer::: Moderna::: or Johnson and Johnson?,There old enough so suspend them for a semester if they can’t follow the rules.,Why is this a Facebook post? If there’s a rule and a student is out of compliance::: then take it up with the student and that student’s parents.,Hey Purdue University you wouldn’t happen to have any prof. who teach Orwell would you? He’s kind of a personal hero of mine and I think you’d take a lot away from his writing,With employers now facing the requirement to monitor their employees' weekly test or vax status could Purdue maybe share how they're doing it?,How about discipline for Purdue employees not wearing masks in the buildings. If one is done::: the other needs to happen,Sad such a good conservative school turned Liberal. Lost my support.,In 1998::: when I first enrolled::: I was required to havw a variety of vaccines in order to start my Freshman year. Purdue is a school of engineering and science. This policy follows that tradition.,"""surveillance testing"" at a ""state school""::: was Purdue founded in ""1984"" or 1869?",What is surveillance testing?,I’m perplexed on some of the comments. I could understand anger if this was a surprise::: but Purdue was extremely transparent on their COVID Guidelines well before tuition payments were due. If students chose not to get vaccinated they agreed to any and all testing. And they clearly outlined what would happen if students skipped testing. The school is merely staying true to the expectations they laid out.,Thank you Purdue. Proud to be a nursing alumni.,So safe!!!Protect Purdue—great mantra.,So very disappointed in Purdue!!,“Surveillance” is the key to any peaceful level of higher education.,Y’all are all ridiculous. People aren’t allowed to choose anymore::: and you comply with a president who said ‘it’s about your safety not your freedom’ which is ironically opposite of the famous term ‘those who give up their freedom for safety deserve neither’. And you are all arguing about a virus that has a 99% survival rate.,I will no longer recommend this university to my friends' children.,Yet they allow a full stadium for football......,"Wow this verbiage says it all..."" surveillance testing""!","""Failing to comply"" lol",Expelling them is the answer. We need to stop playing with these antivaxers,For a university who has some of the greatest scientists and engineers world wide::: you sure do stupid sometimes. This is not about safe it's about control. The kids see through. It's not science is politics,"Stanford:::MIT::: and Berkeley require vaccinations.

Purdue has become a 2nd rate school.",Is PU canceling the 2nd semester?,Guess I won't be finishing my degree there.....,Well this student got a message for you all... and im sure there will be a lot of lawsuits...,Stupid::: leave people alone!,Build a prison camp for those that are NOT VACCINED!! They need to be forced to get it OR GET EXPLELLED!! PERIOD!!!,Grateful to my alma mater for keeping the community safe.,There are online classes.,Kandi Danielle,"So disappointing that people who claim to have a connection to ""higher education"" fall for the phenomenal lies and stupidity spewed by the alt right. Learning to distinguish between ""fake news"" and facts ought to be learned long before college. Anyone angry about this needs to educate themselves thoroughly! Indiana's horribly covid number are evidence of a lot of stupidity!",Thumbs down,expel them honestly,Good for them.,So why didn't you all ever do this with the flu? It is::: after all::: more deadly and just as contagious.,What's next? Mandatory testing for the flu? Common cold? How about HIV?,"If you have over half of the student body and faculty vaccinated then what happened to ""herd immunity?"" If you're vaccinated and want to wear a mask 100% do it::: but don't go forcing other people to put stuff in their body they aren't comfortable with. Once you're ""protected"" why are you worried about what is now the minority.",You knew what you sign,Elizabeth Schamel Munk! Look at our school!! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻,Good!,"From a top v creator.

I hope more sheep wake up and say no to the authoritarian BS the government and schools are trying to force on people.,Hot discussions here.. I may choose a essay topic from this arguments,"""Surveillance testing?"" Wow! Since when does the Government care about our health? When it turns a profit...",Communism at work!!,"""DiSiplinARy aCtIoN""","Vaccinated students should be segregated away from everyone. They are the most infectious and dangerous to be around due to it now being even more difficult to detect covid in them.

The ""Pure bloods"" students and faculty should truly be the only ones allowed on campus. Keep that protein spike away from the healthy students.",Katie Cheon,My biggest issue with this vaccine is it is too new. When they created the chicken pox vaccine they didn't immediately shove it down everyone's throats like they are with Covid. Also they claim you can get shingles from having chicken pox but you can not get the shingles vaxx until you are 50. This vaccine is technically for Sars which is why it isn't working 100%. They have yet to pin the virus down. I personally know people who have died from the vaccine who have also been hospitalized with covid even with being vaxxed. For the most part this virus has a 98% survival rate so leave people along until more testing is done on this.,No isolated virus per CDC. PCR instruments cannot be calibrated; therefore::: impossible to test and diagnose specifically for it.,Purdue can suck a fat one,"Don't worry about the 50 K attending the football stadiums. All of You stop being hypocrites...Th
e Vaccine was developed to protect the "" 50 and Older"" and the preexisting conditions::: not these kids...",What a foolish thing to post.,"Purdue....full of fascist assholes. It disgusts me how thus University is graduating students who will now have all the tools needed to load their neighbors on to trolly cars never to be seen again under the guise of ""my safety"". Disgusting.",Only 84::: I’m disappointed,Big Brother,Liberal Universities create ANTIFA products,Wow::: I did Nazi this coming at Purdue ..... how sad for them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Purdue strengthens campus face mask protocols; masks required for all indoors",7/30/2021 20:00,So the vaccinated are wearing masks to protect those refusing to get vaccinated? Get vaccinated or don’t::: but if you choose not to be vaccinated::: it’s not the responsibility of others to protect you when you won’t protect yourself. Frustrating::: the solution is to get the eligible vaccinated::: not masks.,Tippacanoe county is at a HIGH rate of transmission according to the CDC. Until the county does something to get there their citizens to get the vaccine::: there is little Purdue can do.,Make a choice. Get the vaccine or not. That’s a choice. Masks should be a choice. The people who are affected by the Delta variant the worst are the ones who aren’t vaccinated.,"I cannot believe we are doing this again!! This will never end unless enough people stand up and refuse these arbitrary mandates. It’s so disappointing to see how our country has so easily fallen to their knees in submission to politicians::: fear-mongering:::
and bully tactics.",And just like that the unvaccinated students have no incentive to get vaccinated. What happens after that? We just wear masks indefinitely hoping those 40% of unvaccinated students decide to grow up? This can't go on forever. Purdue needs to take decisive action::: and soon.,"Thank you::: Purdue for keeping my kiddo safe and following the CDC recommendations
.",Just require the COVID vaccine if a student wants to learn on campus. Other Big Ten schools are doing it. If a student is an anti-vaxxer::: they don't belong at Purdue.,Ridiculous. I’m embarrassed I was a Biology major at Purdue.,"If there's one thing I have learned in my life::: it is that science changes. The data we originally observed in regards to vaccine effectiveness was mostly related to the first (alpha) COVID-19 virus. But sadly::: because so many are choosing their individual freedom over an entire nation getting back to normal::: we have allowed the virus to mutate::: putting us back at square one. As a student at Purdue::: I'm glad our leaders listen to the science::: even if its not always what we want to hear. I'll be really upset::: and I know others will be too::: if we don't get to have a senior year full of concerts::: football games::: and outings within our clubs and friend groups because of the unvaccinated. I simply do not understand the issue with getting vaccinated. I can understand not doing it for medical and religious reasons::: but we've had vaccine requirements all the way through elementary school::: middle school::: high school::: and even in college! This one is no different.

I am PROUD to be a Boilermaker!",So the kids can be squished into dorm rooms without a problem::: but it’s too dangerous to be inside other buildings without a mask? This is absurd.,Absolutely ridiculous::: Purdue!,Shoulda followed IU and made vaccines mandatory but I’ll take this as a good step,To anyone complaining about these protocols::: go ahead and exercise your freedom by sending your kid somewhere else to study. No need for drama::: just do it.,Idiot sheep! New name for purdue - IU north.,Come on Purdue. Be better than the rest of the colleges driven by the PC culture. Give students the freedom to choose. “My body my choice”. Isn’t that what they say? Shame on you for caving like the rest of the sheep.,For everyone who used the angry face.... perhaps do your part and get vaccinated so this can stop!

Masks required indoors. What about in dorm rooms that are over crowded?",The biosecurity surveillance state is eagerly awaiting your child's arrival on campus this fall.,Thank you Purdue for following science and CDC guidance👍🏻,I thought you had scientists there?,Based on what?,I’m pretty much 100% positive students would prefer a vaccine requirement with no mask Mandates (like IU) over no vaccine requirement but masks indoors regardless of vaccination status.,Great idea!! There will be so many students from different parts of the world. I know in Ohio we are only 44% vaccinated and 98% of the people are walking around without masks questioning why our numbers are going back up. 🙄,Why??? This is sad::: disgusting::: and embarrassing. If someone has a concern for their safety they can get vaccinated. Do some math!! We are in the weeds here. If you really want to save student lives then mandate that every student take a driving class.,This is disappointing and I’m sad to see Purdue participating in pushing aside individual freedoms. If you want to get a vaccine or wear a mask::: do so or don’t do so. It is (or should be) an individual choice. Covid is here to stay::: unfortunately::: but it’s no excuse to remove personal freedom. Especially when the “science” is extremely sketchy.,Thank goodness. They should have been enforcing this all along..,a mighty lol at the exact 50/50 split in responses from parents and alumni::: with half offering effusive praise and half swearing never to donate again. mitch really couldnt win on this one.,Then why even get the vaccine?? Makes no sense.. politics politics.,"Some of you in this thread seem to have no critical thinking or understanding of how disease transmission works.

Our two options are require the vaccine or wear masks. considering purdue is not requiring the vaccine the only other option is wear masks.","Absurd. The virus has blown through college campuses. Let me see the hospitalization
s and deaths from last year for college age. If there were the neo Marxist PRAVDA media in this country would be exploiting it. Donations are done.",I’m a student that actually has to be on campus and wear a mask… and I’m not complaining. I chose to enroll here::: so I will follow the rules that they give me. Everyone is more than welcome to transfer somewhere that suits their needs and wants. There’s always a choice::: and it’s more than getting the shot or wearing a mask… you can leave. I’ll be on campus this fall::: rolling with the punches::: and taking full advantage of what Purdue has to offer::: and I hope my classmates do the same. #ProtectPurdue,Pisses me off!! My daughter will be a sophomore and we are out of state. Her freshman year last year was awful! Purdue this is not the right call! Mandate the vaccine!,So what I'm hearing is getting vaccinated was a complete waste of time?,Nice job following the science and the evolving data rather than the emotional responses evidenced on this thread!,"At least get rid of the ambassadors. Those power-hungry nobodies harrassed one of my friends about a mask while he was having a panic attack and hyperventilatin
g. Do better Purdue.",First throw away $100K and now this. Won’t be visiting any time soon,"Very disappointing….
and sad for the students.",Has anything else changed for graduation on the 7th?,Half the people commenting here don’t even go to Purdue::: work here::: or have a student here. You’re just here to be a cry baby about something that doesn’t affect you.,Counting down til all the kids’ classes are the high quality on-line type in 3…2…1…,I’m ashamed of my alma mater!

It’s time for everyone to do what they feel is necessary to them personally (and confidentially)
as far as vaccinations and masking::: and move on.","This is nothing more than imagery and wielding power to support it. Until COVID::: there was no concern for our choices::: whether it was the flu vaccine or diabetes. We are all adults and understand the consequences after 1.5 years of the banter about the science. Chose to be vaccinated or not. Chose to wear a mask or not. Chose to protect yourself or not. There is no one person or institution that can control all of us. Your health is your responsibility:::
not mine.",stay mad you anti-maskers,"So ridiculous!!!!!

Look at the death rates folks—it’s minuscule. No need for these new mask mandates. Especially for the young and healthy.
Not to mention that the administration is telling vaccinated American citizens to mask up while they are letting thousands of unvaccinated/
sick illegal immigrants to come into the US—-and then bussing them to towns across several states! Hmmm::: wonder how serious they really are about stopping the spread??","Here's the study. Read it yourself. Notice the caveats/

If any of these students had won::: at least they would be getting rewarded for using their brains and demonstrating academic skills and acumen.,Weird!!,"A friend of mine had a conversation with the CDC about the Wuhan virus and it's experimental vaccinations. It's enlightening:
ME: CDC::: should I get poked if I already had Covid?
CDC: “Yes::: you should be poked regardless of whether you already had COVID-19. That’s because experts do not yet know how long you are protected from getting sick again after recovering from COVID-19.”
ME: Oh::: okay::: we don’t know how long natural immunity lasts. Got it. So::: how long does poke-induced immunity last?
CDC: “There is still a lot we are learning about COVID-19 pokes and CDC is constantly reviewing evidence and updating guidance. We don’t know how long protection lasts for those who are poked.”
ME: Okay … but wait a second. I thought you said the reason I need the poke was because we don’t know how long my natural immunity lasts::: but it seems like you’re saying we ALSO don’t know how long poke immunity lasts either. So::: how exactly is the poke immunity better than my natural immunity?
CDC: …
ME: Uh … alright. But::: haven’t there been a bunch of studies suggesting that natural immunity could last for years or decades?
CDC: Yes.
NEWYORKTIMES: “Years::: maybe even decades::: according to a new study.”
ME: Ah. So natural immunity might last longer than poke immunity?
CDC: Possibly. You never know.
ME: Okay. If I get the poke::: does that mean I won’t get sick?
BRITAIN: Nope. We are just now entering a seasonal spike and about half of our infections and hospital admissions are poked people.
ME: CDC::: is this true? Are there a lot of people in the U.S. catching Covid after getting the poke?
CDC: We stopped tracking breakthrough cases. We accept voluntary reports of breakthroughs but aren’t out there looking for them.
ME: Does that mean that if someone comes in the hospital with Covid::: you don’t track them because they’ve been poked? You only track the UN-poked Covid cases?
CDC: That’s right.
ME: Oh::: okay. Hmm. Well::: if I can still get sick after I get the poke::: how is it helping me?
CDC: We never said you wouldn’t get sick. We said it would reduce your chances of serious illness or death.
ME: Oh::: sorry. Alright::: exactly how much does it reduce my chance of serious illness or death.
CDC: We don’t know “exactly.”
ME: Oh. Then what’s your best estimate for how much risk reduction there is?
CDC: We don’t know::: okay? Next question.
ME: Um::: if I’m healthy and don’t want the poke::: is there any reason I should get it?
CDC: Yes::: for the collective.
ME: How does the collective benefit from me getting poked?
CDC: Because you could spread the virus to someone else who might get sick and die.
ME: Can a poked person spread the virus to someone else?
CDC: Yes.
ME: So if I get poked::: I could still spread the virus to someone else?
CDC: Yes.
ME: But I thought you just said::: the REASON I should get poked was to prevent me spreading the virus? How does that make sense if I can still catch Covid and spread it after getting the poke?
CDC: Never mind that. The other thing is::: if you stay unpoked::: there’s a chance the virus could possibly mutate into a strain that escapes the pokes protection::: putting all poked people at risk.
ME: So the poke stops the virus from mutating?
CDC: No.
ME: So it can still mutate in poked people?
CDC: Yes.
ME: This seems confusing. If the poke doesn’t stop mutations::: and it doesn’t stop infections::: then how does me getting poked help prevent a more deadly strain from evolving to escape the poke?
CDC: You aren’t listening::: okay? The bottom line is: as long as you are unpoked::: you pose a threat to poked people.
ME: But what KIND of threat??
CDC: The threat that they could get a serious case of Covid and possibly die.
ME: My brain hurts. Didn’t you JUST say that the poke doesn’t keep people from catching Covid::: but prevents a serious case or dying? Now it seems like you’re saying poked people can still easily die from Covid even after they got the poke just by running into an unpoked person! Which is it??
CDC: That’s it::: we’re hanging up now.
ME: Wait! I just want to make sure I understand all this. So::: even if I ALREADY had Covid::: I should STILL get poked::: because we don’t know how long natural immunity lasts::: and we also don’t know how long poke immunity lasts. And I should get the poke to keep a poked person from catching Covid from me::: but even if I get the poke::: I can give it to the poked person anyways. And::: the other poked person can still easily catch a serious case of Covid from me and die. Do I have all that right?

"Purdue University trustees on Wednesday (July 7) approved a resolution to open Purdue’s West Lafayette campus to normal operations for the 2021-22 academic year. Learn more: https://purdue.university/3k792Mz

Trustees approve plan to open West Lafayette campus to normal operations",7/7/2021 21:45,"Great job Mitch and Purdue! Just know there are MANY people/parents/
students that are happy with your decision-\-\even if you don't hear from some of them. Boiler Up.","Purdue is doing some great things to combat the pandemic. I am glad to see that Purdue has dispensed lots of vaccinations and is strongly encouraging all campus community members to get vaccinated.

There is still more that Purdue can do to protect the community.

Problem: Purdue is starting regular surveillance testing (https://
protect.purdue.e
du/updates/
new-tool-launchi
ng-to-track-cam
pus-covid-19-va
ccinations-invi
tation-email-co
ming-soon/) starting Aug 23 however student orientation ( https://
www.purdue.edu/
orientation/bgr/
index.html) starts nearly a week earlier on Aug 17. Students will start to arrive and move into dormitories as early as Aug 14th so there will be no surveillance for the first 9 days when students are present. Also::: “regular surveillance testing” is undefined. An infected Purdue student can come into contact with hundreds of others in the course of a single day.

Solution: Begin surveillance testing as soon as students start to arrive. Test daily.

Problem: Purdue is leaving it to students to find their own quarantine (https://
protect.purdue.e
du/updates/
protect-purdue-f
or-fall-2021/) location if they become sick with Covid-19. This is an unrealistic expectation of an 18 - 19 year old who is away from home (and not feeling well). Too many sick students will likely find it easier to stay in their own accommodations and risk spreading the virus.

Solution: Set aside whatever space is necessary for quarantine so no student is left without a safe space to go to when in need of quarantine.

Problem: Purdue is not allowing dormitory residents to request a roommate based on vaccination status. While the vaccinated student should be safe::: there have been cases of vaccinated individuals (https://
www.cdc.gov/
coronavirus/
2019-ncov/
vaccines/
effectiveness/
why-measure-effe
ctiveness/
breakthrough-cas
es.html) getting sick and we don’t know what future Covid mutations might cause.

Solution: Assign all vaccinated dormitory residents a room with another vaccinated resident. Even better::: put all unvaccinated students in a single dormitory building.

The single best thing that Purdue can do is to join hundreds of other universities and colleges (https://
universitybusine
ss.com/
state-by-state-l
ook-at-colleges
-requiring-vacc
ines/) that are requiring vaccination in order to return to campus.",Thank goodness.

The state is open::: open Purdue all the way and get rid of the testing and the masks and the vaccine. If you want to do those things::: do them otherwise let them be kids.,"Thanks for not mandating the vaccine::: but…please stop the segregation and discrimination that is planned for the students who are vaccinated vs the students that have chosen not to get vaccinated.

https://purdue.university/3c3PO5k",5/28/2021 18:00,Highly disappointed in Purdue running this campaign. Bribery at its best. Mitch ain’t my man anymore.,"Awesome approach Purdue. Hope it helps get things back to normal for all the students so they can enjoy their campus experience! My guess is this will pay for itself when Purdue no longer has to pay out all that it did the past few semesters to combat COVID.
Would love to learn the vaccination rate on campus!
Proud to be a Boiler!!!",Ok::: so you folks say the survival rate is so high::: why bother getting the vaccine? I’ll tell you why::: my 8 yr old grandson has a genetic disorder that makes him vulnerable to pulmonary and cardiac viruses. He cannot get the vaccine. So::: he can’t come to Purdue athletic events because there are folks who refuse to vaccinate. He essentially is still a prisoner in his home. Enjoy your liberty. I assume you got measles::: mumps:::& rubella vaccines not to mention a polio vaccine. All killers in their day. And by the way::: my brother-in-law would disagree with your “survival” hypothesis. He went into cardiac arrest and survived after 10 min. of CPR. Cause? Cardiac inflammation after Covid. Get your shot for God’s sake.,The shield on Purdue's seal has three parts representing education::: research::: and service. This program touches all three. Well done Purdue! #BoilerUp,Tim Ruth Merrill,Let all those that ‘Volunteered’ for the shot on Campus last semester enter the lottery!,Embarrassed to say we have Boilermaker alumi in the house!

And before you come at me about the vaccine- I don’t have it and don’t plan to get it. But I also am not going to be mad about my alma mater providing a student with a free year of tuition for making their own decision.

April 26::: 2021
This serves as notice that the mandate for any individual to be tested against COVID-19 for employment or participation at a university or other institution violates federal law. All COVID-19 tests::: whether polymerase chain reaction (PCR)::: antigen tests or others::: are authorized::: not approved or licensed::: by the federal government; they are Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) only. They merely “may be effective.” Federal law states:
Title 21 U.S.C. § 360bbb-3(e)(1)(
A)(ii)(I-III) of the Federal Food::: Drug::: and Cosmetic Act states:
individuals to whom the product is administered are informed—
(I) that the Secretary has authorized the emergency use of the product;
(II) of the significant known and potential benefits and risks of such use::: and of the extent to which such benefits and risks are unknown; and
(III) of the option to accept or refuse administration of the product::: of the consequences::: if any::: of refusing administration of the product::: and of the alternatives to the product that are available and of their benefits and risks.
EUA products are by definition experimental and thus require the right to refuse. Under the Nuremberg Code::: the foundation of ethical medicine::: no one may be coerced to participate in a medical experiment. Consent of the individual is “absolutely essential.” A federal court held that even the U.S. military could not mandate EUA vaccines to soldiers. Doe #1 v. Rumsfeld::: 297 F.Supp.2d 119 (2003).
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued Emergency Use Authorizations for over 200 different test kits manufactured by various organizations. Each of FDA’s EUA letters relies on 21 U.S.C. § 360bbb- 3(e)(1)(A)(ii)(
I- III)::: stating: “This test is only authorized for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of in vitro diagnostics for detection and/or diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2....”
Liability for coercing participation in a medical experiment::: and any injury from it::: may be incalculable. Children’s Health Defense urges U.S. employers::: universities and other institutions to respect and uphold the rights of individuals to refuse EUA tests.

althdefense.org","What to do if your school or employer says you must get the COVID vaccine

The Children’s Health Defense legal team has written three legal notifications that anyone faced with a COVID vaccine::: COVID test or mask mandate can use to inform employers and universities that they are violating federal law. You can download the three notifications here.

All of the notifications include this language:

“Federal law::: Title 21 U.S.C. § 360bbb-3(e)(1)(
A)(ii)(I-III) of the Federal Food::: Drug::: and Cosmetic Act::: states the following about products granted emergency authorization usage:

Individuals to whom the product is administered are informed—

(I) that the Secretary has authorized the emergency use of the product;

(II) of the significant known and potential benefits and risks of such use::: and of the extent to which such benefits and risks are unknown; and

(III) of the option to accept or refuse administration of the product::: of the consequences::: if any::: of refusing administration of the product::: and of the alternatives to the product that are available and of their benefits and risks.

Any entity or organization that requires EUA COVID-19 vaccinations::: COVID-19 tests or masks are in violation of federal law::: and will likely face lawsuits if they don’t allow exemptions or alternatives.”

Submitting the notices prepared by Children’s Health Defense is the first step prior to seeking an exemption or taking legal action.

Vaccine exemption laws vary by state. Go to the National Vaccine Information Center to learn more about your state exemptions.

We all know decisions have to be made in how to move forward in dealing with this virus and I’m thankful I am not in charge of how to do this.

I for one want my daughter to have a normal college year full of games::: social gatherings::: eating in restaurants::: etc! Her freshman year was in no way normal and it was very difficult for her mentally and emotionally but she persevered and stuck it out. If this is the path to a more normal life for our students::: I’m in favor of it.

Will we get a discount on tuition? and I'm curious since this vaccine only offers immunity for 6 months what's the plan?,I think it’s great that you are making vaccinations a priority. I hope more colleges and high school follow the same path. If you choose to not get the vaccine because of personal reasons than you may not have the same choices as others will get. Vaccines are safe and showing great promise. Can’t wait until my 15 and 12 year old can get it!,As a Purdue alum::: I am disgusted with this message. This is an embarassment. If you want to live in fear::: go right ahead. I'm going to live my life.,"""There may be activities we can make available to those vaccinated::: but not those who decline.""

A Protect Purdue press release sent to students just hours later said that students ""may enjoy greater amounts of choice as it pertains to activities on campus.""

No further information on the activities in question has been released as of 1 p.m. Tuesday.

The decision not to require vaccinations is in place ""as of now:::"" Daniels said::: but are ""subject to change if the facts do.""

Protect Purdue will continue to provide free testing to all Boilermakers::: and officials reserve the right to order ""targeted testing"" in perceived hot spots.

A)(ii)(I-III)::: which provides that the person must be informed of the option to refuse to wear the device.
Liability for forced participation in a medical experiment::: including possible injury::: may be incalculable. Children’s Health Defense urges U.S. employers::: universities and other institutions to respect and uphold the rights of individuals to refuse to wear EUA masks.

EUA products are by definition experimental and thus require the right to refuse. Under the Nuremberg Code::: the foundation of ethical medicine::: no one may be coerced to participate in a medical experiment. Consent of the individual is “absolutely essential.” A federal court held that even the U.S. military could not mandate EUA vaccines to soldiers. Doe #1 v. Rumsfeld::: 297 F.Supp.2d 119 (2003).",Sharon Marshall,Bill Montgomery,Sobored Meals,Disgusting. Segregating students based on an experimental biologic pushed by Big Pharma.

So fun!,My son and I were there just this past Monday and Tuesday::: all the way from CA. Everyone was so friendly and helpful; from the students in the welcome center::: our tour guide::: Jake::: the nuclear engineering student::: who spent 30 minutes answering our questions in the Armstrong building to the lovely girl from Orange County CA who showed us the mock dorm room. We walked ourselves around everywhere::: ate on campus at a few of the eateries::: and explored Lafayette as well. My son is very excited to join as FYE shooting for AAE::: with an emphasis in astronautical. He’s even concluded::: after a virtual meet and greet discussion with the All American Band today to audition for marching band at the end of summer! Feels like home already!!,I have two children there and it is been nothing but wonderful with lots of opportunity. And as much as it was a great tour for you guys::: I am sure this boiler enjoyed showing off how terrific Purdue is! Purdue pride::: ever grateful::: ever true! Best wishes to your family and son. Boilerup!,I'm really disappointed that during my whole Master's that I did not get the opportunity to go to the actual school site (dang Covid). One day::: I will get to the campus! So glad you had a great experience... everything that I experienced as a student would reiterate that this culture is imbedded in Purdue::: which makes me super proud to be a Boilermaker! :),Loved our trip to Purdue this week! So impressed with the students who were all wearing masks (outside & inside)::: social distancing & looking like they really love being at Purdue!! My daughter fit right in and is excited to start in the fall in the computer science program. #boilerup,"When we traveled to the Midwest to do our college tours Purdue wasn't a part of the plan. Actually my daughter was pretty adamant that she would NOT be attending a school with a train as a mascot. However::: we had a little time to burn so I said::: ""let's just have a look"". After a brief detour and a stroll/drive around campus::: we got back in the car and she said ""This is the school I'm going to end up going to. Everyone says when you step foot on the campus that was made for you::: you will know."" She knew.",Walking down the engineering mall and watching multiple groups of people smiling::: having fun...the energy on this campus was really infectious! We visited a lot of schools when our son was applying (he's now a sophomore in Honors Engineering) and::: Purdue::: by far::: was the most memorable campus! We love Purdue and it's leadership!,Let’s not forget how great move-in day was during BGR week! Wow!!! That’s the way it should be done at all colleges!!! It’s worth the extra money for that week and move in is flawless::: the traditions are taught too!!! Great week to meet new friends before school starts!,Wait until a group of students meet you at the curb to help your student move in. Moving in all their stuff with kindness and respect for an emotional departure. I was blown away when this happened my daughter’s freshman year. So impressive.,Too many moments to count- BGR::: creating lifelong friendships at Owen and DG::: getting engaged under the bell tower with Bryan Branson... the list goes on.

This became apparently not true at another university.",When I was a prospective student visiting with my mom the amount of students that stopped what they were doing to help us find our way was impressive. I’ll never forget students holding doors for us on that visit either. That sure didn’t happen when I visited IU!,When my niece went to Purdue she felt it was family the minute she stepped campus...her Mother was amazed & asked me what Purdue does to new students to make them feel so quickly bonded. I don't know but it's happened to everyone I know who goes there.,This pick is from our tour pre-Covid. It made me think how few schools would need a sign to tell astronauts where to get lunch.,Texas here; My son did a SURF internship there::: summer of 2017. I attended the presentation he did at the end of the internship and was so impressed by how welcoming and nice everyone was. Beautiful campus too.,I took a campus tour in spring 2019 and knew that day that Purdue was my dream school and I didn’t want to go to college anywhere else. The friendly atmosphere was so inviting and the amount of opportunities available was overwhelming. I can not wait to be a boilermaker this fall as a part of the class of 2025! Boiler up!,On a campus visit for our son two engineering students invited us to eat lunch with them then following lunch went out of their way to walk us to the next building we had to be at!

Teared up a couple times! Purdue definitely felt like home and I remember calling my mom to tell her so several times. 💛🖤 Hoping one of our 3 feels the same when they are making their choice!,I had that experience where a senior::: not wanting us to look silly on our first day::: walked me and my dorm mates around to every building we had class. He showed us shortcuts and places to hang out when we had gaps in our schedule. Saved us from the Freshman mortar board map embarrassment. But it is exactly what I learned to expect from Purdue.,A similar thing happened when my daughter and I were there on a visit 2019. Now my daughter is a sophomore at Purdue and works as a tour guide and she loves it!,We had the same thing happen when I toured campus many years ago.

The world be divided by different kinds of people::: “West” and “Islam” are all strong::: they should be friends in In this earth village nowadays. Unless the Asian people become into the Japanese.
China has ruded the world::: also because of ""Chernobyl"" and “People are strong or not”!
In 1985 I and a classmate crawled through barbed wire::: into a factory::: stole a little eraser scraps. That’s a kind of game that be often played by children at that time socialist China.
But we didn’t know that every Chinese had been monitored by brain-control almost::: Yu quan::: Yu ke::: Yu qiang::: Feng xiaogang::: Ge you::: Wang gang::: etc. were watching us at that time. Now they’re big stars and important people::: so they are must bad people::: did a lot of bad things.
I just know that all my life contacts all things all over the world::: from ""Chernobyl"" to “911” to “Coronary virus”::: all the things are from me! China negated the socialism by our game::: made “Chernobyl” by brain-control. Then Soviet disaster::: Eastern European disaster be made by Chinese brain-control. A task of socialist construction is not the reason for negotiating socialism. The US did not know the truths::: but willing to cooperate with China with the things that are conducive to the US. So Iraqi disaster::: Afghanistan disaster::: ""911""::: Syrian disaster::: all the athletes death::: all the artists death::: the Western people's destruction::: Human civilization's destruction::: only brain-control system in western countries……be happened by Chinese brain-control. China cleverly covered all the offenses by “64”::: China’s spy Li ddenghu::: “Non-typical pneumonia”::: earthquake::: “coronary virus”::: all “the own disasters”.
And China has ruled all brain-control all over the world::: has ruled the US::: has ruled the world! All are because of the US spreaded democracy by Insufficient just way::: and the fallen of the bourgeoisie.
So the world that all things under false appearance is such!
The health of people be broken by brain-control::: so the people's spirit and country's system will be destroyed. This world is so miserable!

Purdue cancels in-person class meetings due to heavy snow. ❄️ LEARN MORE ➡️ https://www.purdue.edu/emergency/,2/16/2021 0:12,The University never cancelled class when I was there::: I always I had to do it myself!!! 😡 😬,"28"" of snow during finals!!! Still had them!",We closed today for half an inch of ice.,"Having spent about a year doing eLearning/
remote learning::: it’s probably easier to pull the trigger to cancel in person classes. When I was on campus back around 1980 (+ or - 2 years) they canceled classes one day::: which I believe was the first time since the beginning of time or thereabouts. 🤪🤣🤠","We got 1.5 days in 2007 for snow...Tippecan
oe Co was under emergency travel only. I don’t know exact ❄️ amount but I believe >12”. However we still had to walk to class in -30 windchill. 🤷🏻‍♀️ They also had a snow day in 2011.",They didn't cancel classes back in the olden days & women were not allowed on campus in slacks or jeans no matter how deep the snow or low the temperature!,Wimps! Back when I went to Purdue::: we had to walk to class barefoot::: in the snow::: uphill both ways::: five miles and they never cancelled classes. 😆,Anyone remember 1991 Spring semester when there was at least an inch of ice on EVERYTHING?,I graduated in ‘53 and never had a snow day. Women could not wear slacks. I had to walk to the Engineer Campus from trike the hotdog root bear restrant,Once when the wind chill was -60. But::: we all made the game vs IU at Mackey that night!,I don’t miss the ice polishers. Why would a engineering powerhouse of a school think using rotating wire brushes was the best way to clear snow?,I remember walking to class only to find a note on the classroom door cancelling class. I pictured the professor sitting in a leather chair in his study calling it in to some poor teaching assistant. 😂,"I don't recall ever having classes cancelled in the six years I was there from 1973 to 1979. I remember some days we were hopeful::: but our hopes were always dashed :-)

Naive Florida boy that I was::: I bought the warmest jacket I could find for sale in the mall where I lived::: south of Miami. I froze even wearing two sweaters underneath it::: but it took awhile for it to dawn on me that I should shop for proper winter jacket.

I also had a few cartoonish mishaps walking on sheet ice::: going from vertical to horizontal in a split second. One time I landed on my face instead of my back and hit so hard a filling came out and I had to have a gash in my face sewn up at the student hospital. That's what university is for right::: teaching you new things...

I remember days when the snow plow pushed up so much snow that there was a continuous 6 foot high pile on side of the street. You knew your car was under there somewhere::: but you had to dig exploratory holes first to find it::: and then spend an hour shoveling the snow off the top::: away from both sides::: the front::: the back::: and even underneath it in order to get it out.",What?!? We had class in this crap when I was there!,My daughter would rather go to class than have a snow day. Although most of her classes are online due to covid. Going to school during a pandemic::: wearing a mask::: socially distancing::: being randomly tested and not being able to be in groups is mentally challenging for all of them. I think they are pretty resilient.,What? How much snow is there? My dad bought me a special heavy winter weather jacket knowing the weather and they don’t cancel classes when I started.,I was just telling my kids about walking from Harrison Hall to campus for class. COLD days::: wind and not good gear to wear. Brutal. Somehow I don’t remember having a snow day ever.,What? No cancellations in 1988-1992. We got to experience the polished ice from the snow brush machine. 🤣😂,I told my son going to class in weather like this builds character.,The Pizza trucks made it to the dorms just fine the day that classes were cancelled for a day in the mid '80's. 🤣 Yup - went sledding on lunch trays at Slayter that day! I think it was more about profs at IUPUI who couldn't navigate the drifts on I-65 to get to Purdue.,I remember an ice storm when I went there and the wind literally pushed me to class on iced sidewalks😳,"Yep we got an accumulation of 5 to 7 inches and single did get rem-s in Lafayette. I still have to shovel my walks and drive way for the4 time in 3 weeks.

Hey door dash and Amazon are still delivering. So I’m cool.

Off course my heat went out for maybe 24 hours. New house for me. The heat got urned off for some reason. I found the problem the next day and fixed it. This move has been heck.",I graduated Purdue in 1953 -we never had a day off for snow. I had to walk up the level to the Engineer Campus near Carey Hall,So they canceled classes so campus isn’t closed??,"Never had classes canceled by the university. We walked ( rather skated- ice polishers) in ice storms::: blizzards and thunderstorms with our wimpy umbrellas.

Once I got to class and after waiting 15-20 minutes for the professor to show only to find out he was stuck and couldn’t get there.",My son is from Southern California we are not used to this. Everything is safe right?,I remember walking to 7:30 am classes in the Field house::: in the snow::: in the dark! I’d walk in tire tracks as sidewalks had not been shoveled!,Class was canceled once in my four years due to an ice storm. I’ll never forget walking to my finals freshman year::: snow up to my knees and a windchill of -14 degrees. Not to mention the bitterly cold nights as a student security patroller. It was always beautiful though.,They got soft::: never closed once when we were there::: and winter patterns were way worse!!!,And women couldn’t wear jeans or slacks on campus to classes!,I remember the snow days and evenings of glow in the dark freebies::::::::: It was cold ::: it was dark and I was much younger then!,In nursing school 1965. Not allowed to miss any classes,I was attending when Purdue closed for the first time in school history because of extremely low temps- remember Tricia?!?!,Only one day and that was due to temps. The next day was almost as bad but they didn’t cancel classes.,The semester started a day or two late in January 1981 or January 1982. Heavy snow closed I65 the Sunday we were due back.,In the four years I attended they only canceled school once,Wowza ...I agree! Purdue rarely canceled classes when I was a student::: except for the winter of 78.,Can you imagine when global warming really takes hold?,...and the ice on the sidewalks was always freshly polished to a glistening sheen. You really had to up your game to make it across the grayly-shaded frozen hellscape. But you knew a warm cup of coffee awaited you in the Union.... if you made it there.,Spent the ‘78 blizzard at Harry’s!😃,My son had an exam this evening and he lives off campus so he left 2 hours early to make which he never did because he got stuck and is still waiting on a tow truck They cancelled the exam after my son got stuck,What about online students with spotty/limited Internet?,When I was a frosh in 96 they called classes off for one day and not because of 24 inches of snow but -70 wind chill. Back then we had to call collect!,"I remember ""sliding"" over the sheets of ice to class at 7:30am. Closing for snow is unheard of","I remember riding my bike to Lynn Hall.....in a snowstorm...wit
h a backpack on!",Yeah kids are soft these days::: never had a snow day when I was there,I still have to be there at 1030 though,Anyone remember when Dr. Beering canceled class due to weather and it turned out to be a beautiful day? Everyone went sledding and he swore never to cancel classes again.,Never happened when I was there.,Second time in my 8.5 years there,Only once during my time there...,Only once do I remember back in 1985,Amen! We walked no matter what the weather was like,We never got out of class for snow!,Lame! Is there 4 foot snow drifts yet::: then we can talk!,Only missed two days. That was due to -40”,I remember synchronized swimming in the woman’s gym... 7:30 am... 1967...,Happened blizzard 1977!,I loved walking across campus. Cold wind stinging your face. LIVING!!!,And carry all your books and hockey gear...,Only once. 1978,Did hell freeze over?!?,Reminds me of 1978,"Hey::: hey now! You people talking about the good old days where we never misssed a day for weather. You people are FOS!

Between 79 and 83 we missed a lot of days. Once I remember a storm hitting on the 1st day of Spring semester. We missed a day or two there.

I also remember a bitter cold spell that hit and it was unsafe to walk to class::: and they canceled. Actually::: I remember a few days like that.

Jim Ford do you remember or was it before you got there?",Happened during my time there in 1996,Never happened when I was there,Never canceled when I was there!,Were you part of the team,"https://

"It’s all about the details in #Purdue Memorial Union. 🖤💛 The historical design holds many meanings::: including the stained glass windows representing the mix of students of all races and creeds welcome within its walls. #FlashbackFriday to 1977. Purdue Memorial Union

Learn more about the architecture: https://purdue.university/3ah04Hf",2/12/2021 14:01,Thanks for posting it's been years since I've been there. Lots of great memories of working on campus and Don as a student. We !lived in married student housing::: which I heard was torn down.,I love sitting here::: on the other side there’s a fireplace and I’ve seen it going once. Another time someone was playing the piano. You never know what gem this area will offer up.,The sweet shop ::: good friends ::: hamburgers and fries and studying way back in 1977 1978 . It was so precious to spend time there . They had dances there . We used to watch Tv there in between classes . Thanks 🙏 loved it .Boiler up ❤️❤️❤️🌹,One of my favorite places to study for finals. I would find a vacant::: majestic lounge area that would transport me to a different realm. It was calming::: and I felt able to concentrate. Such a treasure!,A fun place to hang out as a preteen/teen. Bowling::: pool::: soft pretzels at the Sweet Shop. The tunnels::: the map. The Christmas Tree.,Awesome to hear the history of this beautiful building! Boiler UP!!,I hope the world gets back to normal because I would love to show my teenagers where I spent 5 great years.,the cafeteria downstairs was pretty good.,There was a reflecting pond while I was there::: 1980-1989.,"I had a look at the Wikipedia page for the Purdue Memorial Union. I zoomed in on the stained glass windows::: to the point that I could read the texts along the top and bottom.

As best I can make out::: it says...
""Our poor spirit is so weak it is only through the use of materials that it can rise to the truth.""

Around the figures are references to ""Sister Water""::: ""Brother Wind""::: ""Brother Fire""::: ""Brother Earth"".

Some of the figures are cradling things in their arms like Mary might be cradling Jesus in a medieval picture::: except in this case what I see cradled are a train::: a plane::: and a tank::: among other things::: some of which I didn't immediately recognize. This is in keeping with the union being a war memorial.

At the bottom is:
""In memory of James H. Smart President of the University 1883 - 1900. Presented to the University by the Class of 1940.""

The figures are in the same style as craftsmen::: knights or saints that you might find in stained glass windows in medieval cathedrals.

So here is my question: how did you come up with this interpretation?


>> ""The historical design holds many meanings::: including the stained glass windows representing the mix of students of all races and creeds welcome within its walls.""

I have no objection to rededicating it as such::: but I find the notion doubtful that in the 1930's a rainbow coalition existed and had that in mind when the stained glass was designed.

I don't see any people of color represented in it::: nor any indication of creeds or religions::: apart from the style itself having been copied from Christian cathedrals.",I was trying to take a picture of all of the colored stained glass but it didn’t come out because it’s gotten faded.,I loved just finding a corner in the Union and studying. When I think about my years there::: that’s my favorite college memory.,Is there a way to find a list of all the performers decades ago playing at the Elliot Hall of Music? Like The Supremes,Great building to go to for all sorts of events.,So much fun there as a kid::: billiards::: bowling::: pinball::: hanging out::: checking out the train club in the basement etc. Then as a student::: studying::: taking quick naps::: dining...,The hot bread sticks and cheese dip at the student memorial grab n go.,Except they removed the portraits from the facility lounges on the 2nd floor of the people who made the university what it is today😔😔😡,I liked the reflecting pool/mud pit.,To bad its rich history has been destroyed by greed.,I miss the reflecting pond.,Hope Kelley,When was the reflecting pool removed?,I do.,BOILER UP HAMMER DOWN TYLER STRONG,😂😂,Boiler-Up,Hail Purdue.,Heheheje.

I could leave my parents home::: get to and park (for free) at the airport in 20 minutes and get to my flight. I took lots of Air Wisconsin flights in the late-70's::: 80's and early-90's.,Our family would go there for dinner at the cafeteria. The guard gave us gum::: which they also gave to passengers to chew and help avoid ear popping in small planes.,"My Father was a Purdue Graduate::: he was a Civil Engineer::: he worked at the Purdue Airport in the late 60's and early 70""s until his death.",My mother was the first Purdue coed to fly!,I had the privilege to fly from the Purdue airport in 1968,That is so interesting !!! How awesome,I flew into the airport as a freshman in the fall of 1990.,Wanted to take this class but my parents would allow me too. At that time your parents need to approve such thing until u were 21.,I flew on Lake Central::: Allegheny::: and probably a few other long gone airlines in and out of that airport back in the day.

(I use them as a backdrop for headshots and they haven’t failed me yet.☺️),It is a beautiful historical building! Helps to give Purdue University character!,Great article.,I was a student from 1965-1969 and had PE classes there as well as swimming. At that time every freshman had to pass a swimming class. (Prerequisite for graduation) I also played basketball on the Woman’s Intercollegiate Club team. We played a couple of games there and I remember my parents watching from the track above. If walls could talk::: I think there would be great stories. Am pleased it wasn’t torn down and replaced but refurbished and put to good use! It will always be the Memorial Gym to me!,I hated that swimming pool. It was only 20 yards long::: and as a previous competitive swimmer::: I knew instinctively how many strokes in a lap (of a normal 25 yard pool). I crashed into the wall more times than I care to remember::: while mindlessly swimming laps.,"Very familiar with this building as the Women's Gym! Used to have to ""run"" after class to get to the dining hall at my dorm before the doors for dinner closed.",good read! I was there from 1987-1992::: and now have a freshman there in CS.,Elliot Hall is nice...like grandma's living room. You can sit in it but you better not touch nuthin'.,I swam in the pool there in 1983. Not sure when the pool was eliminated.,I spent years as a grad student there!

Would love to only pay what I was paying as University staff and park in any surface lot or garage I choose.,"As ""boomers"" age::: Purdue has consistently made it harder to park close to buildings. Youth will be served::: I guess. ☹",As boomers age- more and more undergrads go to purdue. Yup that makes sense. Puurde knows where the money is at.,I remember getting a parking ticket the one time I parked in that lot...,Was there when it was a parking lot,The clapping circle!,I didn't even know it wasn't a parking lot any more. I remember crossing that parking lot as a grad student every day in the late 1980s to buy lunch for $1 in the basement of the Union: a cup of soup and a piece of bread.,*squeak*,I remember the parking lot. This is much better.,In the mid 50's my future husband had a reputation for luckily often finding a parking spot very close to the Hall of Music when we had a date for a special program there!,I supervised the landscape installation of that mall....back-in -the day.,I remember well::: and I’m glad they changed it.

As it should be....education doesn’t have to put you in debt for the rest of your life to be excellent.,Frozen tuition::: but increased enrollment::: making it harder to get classes::: professor time::: and housing.

Grandson graduated and granddaughter now a junior.!!!,So proud of the job Mitch and the BOT have done Boiler Up,We appreciated the frozen tuition and the drive and grit it took to get through this past semester when everyone said it couldn’t be done.

Boiler Up!,Amber Schindler it’s going to end up being on the cheaper side of my choices too then,Steven Acker Lindsay Acker,Proud alumni ::: always being part of the solution . Boiler up !!!!,It's great that tuition has frozen::: but Mitch's salary sure hasn't. The tuition freeze is just a PR move. Many colleges that aren't Engineering and Agriculture are seeing cuts that don't give them the resources to fairly pay their graduate students and adjuncts::: student services are overstretched (try to get yourself an appointment at CAPS!)::: and there aren't enough class seats or dorm rooms for all the extra students being admitted because increasing enrollment is one of Mitch's bonus items.

Igor Semiletov::: the chief scientist aboard a vessel carrying 65 scientists on a 40-day research voyage::: told CNN via satellite phone that he found amounts of methane in the air over the East Siberian Sea up to nine times the global average. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas::: with a significantly greater global warming potential than carbon dioxide::: according to NASA. The methane emissions in the Arctic::: fueled by the melting of permafrost on the sea floor::: are one driver of climate change::: NASA said. The emissions are presenting a growing risk.

Way to encourage the kids but prevent it from happening.,My son had all the symptoms of Covid and his test came back negative. He went to emergency room twice last Saturday with 104 temperature and a lot of the symptoms. Do tor said he probably has it. He has quarantined in his apartment. He is not coming home since he's been sick..thank goodness he's feeling better. All his roommates tested negative so I think his test may not have been done correctly.,Reeds semester was designed to end tomorrow. No need to go back until January. They have to get their temp taken every day since school started.,Mine are too- and I do appreciate Purdue! What I don’t appreciate is the scary news article today that said getting tested Wednesday doesn’t mean you are good for Thursday- and if people (like kids from college) aren’t living in your home - you should not have them for thanksgiving!! I mean::: I’m still having them::: but now I will worry more!!!!!,My daughter has been tested NINE times at Purdue! All negative! Can’t wait to see her Tuesday night!,I know it has NOT been anything but a pain for the students this year. You are doing all you can do. Please remember if you quarantine students ...

Lots of people work their butts off to become professional athletes::: but don’t make it due to lack of talent or mental fortitude. Don’t even get me started on the other road blocks to success many are born into due to race::: disability and/or social class.

"""When you honor the #ProtectPurdue Pledge you are not just taking care of yourself::: you are taking care of everyone at this entire institution."" - Mitch Daniels::: Purdue University President https://purdue.university/2JfPzsp  YOUTUBE.COM Mitch Daniels Protect Purdue Video Update: Let's keep going.",2020-10-29 21:40:58,Dan Repay,We were there this weekend visiting our daughter. She is depressed and miserable. 1/2 classes in person 1/2 on line. She can’t do any of her activities or clubs she participated in last year as they were cancelled due to Covid. It’s very stressful. The kids worry about getting sick. For the 3 days we were there we hardly saw kids out the campus was dead. And we just received an email saying next semester you have to be on campus no matter what even if all of your classes are all on line. No more being remote and online. This Is bullshit. It is all about the money you cannot ask students to live on campus tell them no spring break and have them take their classes on line and stay in their dorm rooms. If your goin to do that Purdue then make all the professors teach their classes in person! And have all classes in person. I am a Purdue grad myself very disappointed with purdue,Poor Kids are miserable at School.,👍,Thank you Mitch Daniels and Purdue students for doing such a great job,Thank you Mitch Daniels for keeping us open and going. Proud of Purdue. Proud to have been a student. Proud to be employee.,You can argue about this all you want::: but the bottom line is hospital beds at IU Health Arnett are almost full and if things don’t improve more restrictions will be coming. Purdue is not an island. What goes on there affects the rest of Tippecanoe County. Even if our young::: healthy students experience only mild symptoms that won’t be true for everyone. I’m not sure why that seems to be such a difficult concept for some.,Another great message from a great leader.,"If Mitch cared at all about our mental health::: then we wouldn't need a ""significant change"" to do all online classes. A pandemic would be enough. This semester wouldn't be as disorganized as it has been. The Breakfast Club situation should not have been allowed. Football would not be happening if anyone cared about the safety of the athletes or their families. We would have had even ONE day of break::: but we really don't. Because the one we were given is optional::: so we have been going at this non-stop until Thanksgiving gets here. Weekends don't count anymore::: because those are also taken up by work. He can pretend all he wants that he cares::: but he is doing this for the money. If he had any sympathy for us::: he wouldn't keep spreading the GRIT gospel about how Purdue students can withstand anything. It's a pathetic excuse to turn a blind eye to the fact that many students have become depressed due to all the work we have thrown at us during a global crisis.",Why/how were those participating in the Breakfast Club not violating the Protect Purdue Pledge?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What a pleasant coincidence.,Graduated in 95 and watched it being build. Remember the smokestack - def upgrade!,"This reminded me of other historical things at Purdue. The Old Water Pump. I was a tour guide 37 years ago working for the Greater Lafayette Convention & Tourism bureau and met my husband of 35 years (anniversary next week) when he was a charter bus driver from Indianapolis. The water pump has a history of ""romance"" in that couples would agree to meet at the pump at certain times during the night when it was allowed to be out if you needed water. I wondered if it still worked when I shared this with the tour group and Bill knew that was my signal I was available. :) Did not intend to ramble::: but this brought the memory to mind when I saw it.  https:// www.purdue.edu/ newsroom/ purduetoday/ didyouknow/2014/ Q4/ did-you-know-the -old-pump-.html",Heck::: we had Pots!,And to this day::: I still refuse to walk under it...the power of the bell tower is unwavering.,When I was a student::: we didn’t have the bell tower...We had the smokestack! 😂🤣,Same here!

#Repost @boilerambassadors with @get_repost ・・・ Today’s #SmallStepsWithStudents in healthcare feature is Isabella Hannigan from @boilerfootball 🏈🏈🏈  What is your healthcare role?: Right now I’m an athletic trainer with the football team so I do a lot of their treatments before and after practice.  How was your role impacted by COVID-19? Did you work during the pandemic/lockdown?: During covid I wasn’t able to work with any teams but I did work as a pharmacy tech which was really interesting during the covid era. We did curbside pickup and curbside vaccines which was definitely interesting.  What is your favorite health tip to give to students?: My favorite health tip would be focus on wellbeing as a whole::: and not just one aspect.  What is your favorite part of being back on campus?: My favorite part about being on campus is meeting new people and learning different perspectives::: whether in person or virtually.  #LetsPlayFootball #PurdueUniversity #BoilerUp,2020-10-11 16:37:32,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Especially at Purdue!,Didn’t you guys just disband all the departments that actually study this stuff?,Thank you::: Purdue::: for this. Outstanding!,The accurate quote is “The only remedy to racist discrimination is antiracist discrimination. The only remedy to past discrimination is present discrimination. The only remedy to present discrimination is future discrimination. ” You missed a word in there that changes the meaning.,"""The only remedy to past discrimination is present discrimination.

African forest elephants::: highly sociable animals::: travel in small family groups to meet others at these muddy water sources::: which are full of rich minerals they can’t find in the forests.

As we conclude the first week of classes::: it’s way too soon for celebrations::: but it’s not too soon to say thank you for the overwhelming cooperation and compliance that’s helped us get off to a good start. #ProtectPurdue #PurdueUniversity #BoilerUp https://purdue.university/3b2vKPh  YOUTUBE.COM Purdue President Daniels and students encourage campus to continue with Protect Purdue guidelines,2020-08-28 14:59:02,Thank you!,I like that they addressed the risks associated with weekend activities. It's not just about adherence on campus but off campus::: too. I hope we get through this and all of the fun activities I remember from my time on campus can resume!,When new systems and procedures are implemented it’s not uncommon for issues to occur. As parents and alumni we can encourage and coach Purdue students how to collaborate and work with university officials to resolve the issues together. We need to remember that the students on the Purdue campus are no longer children::: but adults. We owe it to them to be treated as the intelligent adults that they are.,Someone needs to call the University of Illinois and find their program to test students twice a week without standing in line and missing class. Today's testing a very inefficient joke,I am disappointed that all my son's classes went to online AFTER they collected tuition.,I would like to know what Purdue is going to do about the lines in the food courts. My son won’t even go to the food courts because of these lines. I appreciate what Purdue is doing to protect the student and staff however I can’t believe that I’m the only parent who’s child feels overwhelmed with these lines.,Carolyn Josten,Hail Purdue! Thank you Daniels and staff.,Great attitude. Boiler up,If you have a problem with Purdue take it up directly the University. Purdue has and is doing everything possible to stay up and running under current circumstances. There are going to be challenges. This is all new territory for everyone and they deserve our support for their efforts!!!,I have heard all positive from my twin freshmen! Thank you Purdue👌,Mitch will you consider running for POTUS in 2024? Please we need your leadership,So very grateful Purdue has given this situation a shot... hopefully students can stay on campus::: long lines and all.🤞🏼. And even more hopeful professors are considerate of the situation when it comes to grading 😀,Good timing for the message about being safe over the weekend. Hopefully it also went through other channels too. My Boiler never uses FB.,Kudos to the Purdue community....,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Join us as we set on a path toward racial justice::: together. Experts and thought leaders will speak in online streaming sessions during the academic year. Learn more about the speakers and event details. #PurdueTogether #Purdue #BoilerUP http://purdue.university/racial-justice-series,2020-08-25 14:10:02,How about “Equal Justice”?,looks a little one sited to me,Glad purdue is finally attempting to take a real stance. Can’t wait to see what comes out from this. It’s obvious that they will get a bunch of backlash along the way since they used the word “racial”,The fact that this topic is so triggering for people says A LOT. Purdue hosts a wide variety of speakers every year; this is just one and it is an important one. For those of you who claim to be so open to freedom and free speech::: ask yourself... why am I so threatened by words like “racial justice” and “thought leader.” There is nothing offensive about this post other than the hateful comments being posted. So disappointed in the larger Purdue community right now 😔,Purdue is now a liberal marxist school? Or is this just an attempt to keep “relevant”.,I'm a Boilermaker since birth. I'm sad::: embarrassed::: but not surprised they are falling for this. A school built on the rigors of science and engineering falls for baseless demagoguery and identity politics peddled by guilt merchants. It's a shame.,https:// www.facebook.com /1523827892/ posts/ 1021770711989945 1/ ?extid=UNXwutLmC IUu1QSa&d=n,Wondering how one becomes a “thought leader” (new major?) and who are these “experts”?,Oh for crying out loud. This means Purdue staff will have even more mandatory annual training 😂,“Thought Leaders” 🤔,You’re part of the problem Purdue.... we don’t have a Racial Justice problem. If you have to put racial in front of any problem::: you are part of the problem. 🇺🇸,Good job Purdue....provi ding a venue to LISTEN to someone from a different culture and experience than myself. This is how we learn AND can be intelligent enough to decide for ourselves AFTER listening to others what we will believe/ support.,Yes!! Purdue. Always willing to be part of the solution. Very proud alumni.,Some universities are making this a mandatory 1 credit course for depth of understanding. Our kids will be leaders with one leg up with inclusivity and open to diverse thought in their tool kit.,Need to say nothing more...  https:// www.google.com/ amp/s/ justthenews.com/ politics-policy/ video-resurfaces -which-black-li ves-matter-foun der-says-groups -creators-are-t rained%3famp,There is racial justice in the US. Maybe you should put on a course about why Americans should follow police instructions in their encounters. That’d result in less shootings than this fake narrative of racial inequality.,Racial Justice? What about our Constitution? What about our fundamental rights and freedom of this Country ::: this is a freedom country!,Purdue::: lead the way by providing free tuition like uncle Joe wants. No? Didn’t think so.,If we got the justice we deserve::: we would all end up in Hell,Keep at it Purdue! Obliviously ^ plenty of alumni need it too!,"Anyone else have a problem with the term ""thought leaders""",Its weird how we went from racism is bad to being against racism is somehow equal to Communism in a relatively short time.,Guys! I am Purdue mom::: what is happening with you? Purdue in the left side? Be carful with the prestige of the university.,Good news for fellow Travelers!,Doug Huntley,Did racial injustice drop out of the sky in 2020 or just the HR PR of virtue signaling? Reminds me of #MeToo sexual harassment in 2019 when everyone promised to address and this year complete vapor in the media.,"Racial justice does not mean BLM and BLM only. If you are making these connections they are based on your own prejudices. If you think that treating people with kindness instead of racist remarks is marxist::: then I hope you educate yourselves. Racial justice does not make Purdue left. It makes it a good university. Imagine going up to someone and saying ""I hope your professors treat you differently based on the color of your skin"". That is not okay. This is what Purdue is trying to stop and other similar things. Racial equality is not political. It is what is right",Lmao I’m loving all the broflakes having meltdowns in the comments 🤣,Thank you Purdue! Great slate of presentations!,No indoctrination of the left and it’s culture. Kids are not going to college to learn to be communist or Marxist. Thanks but NO thanks alma mater !,About a month ago Purdue Alumni Association sent an email talking about their video conference called We All Matter attended by 900 people of all races discussing how to bring everyone together about racial justice etc.; sounds great right! No; the next day they apologized for the hurt they caused to black students and alumni and promised to do better in the future and said they would always support #BLM the organization.,Lisa Marie 👀,I can do without the Marxist propaganda. Thought leaders??,talking is good.  actions are better.  kind words and loving your neighbor is best.,Can anyone say thought police. Maybe open up some reeducation camps as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Please do something about this,👏👏👏👏👏,So many comments from disgruntled parents complaining. Never in our lifetime have we experienced a global pandemic. I have no doubt the University has spent countless hours and a ridiculous amount of money so your child has an opportunity to attend Purdue this fall.

If not to actually teach live - whether in person or by Webex - what are they being paid for?",This is all well and good::: but can we address the lines these students must stand in to get their meals from their mandated meal plans?,"And according to my daughter who attends::: they ran out of their ""safety kits"" in less than 30 minutes today and won't have any more until Thursday. This in addition to lying to her repeatedly when she called about her status on the dorm wait list. She was told they didn't know anything::: only to find out they NEVER had her on the list. They told her last week and she had to scramble for a place to live for however long the semester may last. I liked Purdue up to this point but I am not at all happy with them now.",I’ve never read so many righteous self centered posts in my entire life. “Me me me me me” “my my my my my”.

I would probably choose to postpone school if this is what it is like.,Prayers for all the students starting to class. Some of our most fun times at college.,Thanks to the University for bringing Boilers back to campus. Thank you students for doing your part in the PPP. Boiler Up!,We are here for every student and interacting more than you think. I put it all on the them yesterday in class to reach out and stay connected. Our staff and faculty are intentionally being here with them.,I’m more concerned about the students’ mental wellness. Right now they are scared to talk to anyone and are supposed to pretty much stay in their room alone. Walking to class in 96 degrees afraid to take a water bottle because they’re afraid they’ll be suspended if they pull down mask to take a drink. This is not Purdue.,No they are not.,We do hope young students follow these guidelines for their own and others' safety. We know it's fun to party. Don't be like the recent group that was suspended.

Hope all continues to go well!,So glad to see that Purdue was able to kick off the year with their annual BGR!

Everyone is trying to do their part.,💛😷🖤🚂👍,I agree,Daughter's boyfriend returning to campus today. If I were to place a bet::: I'd say they will be virtual within a month. It will be interesting to see how the experiment works - social distancing and mask wearing with the college crowd. Adults have trouble with it....hope the kids do better.,People need to follow the rules.

#Purdue University announced Wednesday (Aug. 19) that students who violate the requirements of the Protect Purdue Pledge are subject to disciplinary action via the university’s Regulations Governing Student Conduct::: Disciplinary Proceedings and Appeals. #ProtectPurdue https://purdue.university/3hcOhdV  PURDUE.EDU Purdue adds violation of Protect Purdue Pledge to student code of conduct regulations,2020-08-19 20:30:56,Boiler Up!!,Just not right,BOILER UP HAMMER DOWN TYLER STRONG,I'm glad some teeth are being put behind the masking regulations!!!,Good for all the work being done. Now-and this may not be the place to yell::: but.. A BLM demonstration on campus today with hundreds in it led by police cars. And other big groups even in the Exponent. They pick on CP where most of the guy's were just in their rooms not participating with the 12-15 partying??? Hey::: their folks aren't big donors to the university?? 3rd generation though...,what's going on??,"For all of you who are bitching about ""Protect Purdue""; I'm sure Tony Butkovich would have liked staying on campus with whatever rules may have been in place at the time::: instead of heading to Paris Island::: then later to Okinawa where he was KIA. Maybe today's youth need to face real life::: which says that there are no guarantees in life ( I know::: the old death and taxes idea )::: but what happens if they have to have a year. or so::: NOT at university. My nephew finished a 5-year hitch in the Marine Corps::: and literally enrolled in college last year. I call him ""Marine"" because he earned the title ! Maybe a hitch in the military would teach the youth of today that they don't need ""safe places"" on a college campus::: but that ""learning::: oft for the sake of learning"" is what it's all about-\-\-then being prepared for a career based on a serious course of study and the actual education they achieved. And I::: like the young woman in the YouTube video::: am a BOILERMAKER ! Class of 1967.",Are the students at the protest going to be suspended for violating the protect Purdue pledge. Definitely in violation,I am upbeat but skeptical.,I can’t say for all of Purdue::: especially what goes down in Chauncey and off campus areas! But as a student and someone working at the Purdue Starbucks right now::: I see everyone following rules::: wearing masks etc. In fact I see every Purdue student wearing a mask! The only people that don’t wear a mask sometimes are locals at a gas station or somewhere::: but since the governor mandated that::: things have been better,Big shout out to all the SERVICE STAFF EMPLOYEES working hard on campus to ensure students can have a safe return. The real heroes of Purdue.,"Awesome - ""if you can't follow the rules::: there's no place for you here."" Wish we could send that to the general population! Keep it together::: Boilermakers and dhow the world it's possible.",Bait & Switch... Get all the students moved in and then have each teacher message the students telling them that their classes will be online. My daughter now has all but 1 class online. The 1 class that they are calling in-person is only meeting in-person every 4th class. Otherwise::: she sits in her dorm room less than 6 feet from her roommate (because the desks are side by side) and logs in to her classes. Which way is it Purdue...safe or not? I am a very disappointed alum.,Knowing how well Purdue's student conduct rules prevent cheating (spoiler alert: they don't)::: I can imagine how well this will work.,University of Illinois has put a great plan in place. Purdue should follow suit. https:// covid19.illinois .edu/ health-and-suppo rt/ on-campus-covid- 19-testing/,They took covid test before coming back...chill,I think this is dumb to be punished like this.,We just moved our son in today. While I am impressed with what I saw on campus today::: and students around town getting lunch etc... It is now 10:40pm::: and we have been walking all over campus and Lafayette since 6pm. Unfortunately it will not be long before we are closed down like every other university we are seeing on TV. The bars and restaurants are slammed without masks. While some are probably locals ::: I’m guessing many/most are students. I’m from a state that has high #’s and I assumed being a college town they would want to protect their economy with stricter protocol. Now that the classes are all being pushed on-line I can only imagine students will feel the need to be off campus more as well. Since they will be stuck in their dorms studying all day. I was feeling hopeful::: now disillusioned!,The students deserve a college experience::: let them have one.,Get an education you have life after college to party. This is a different kind of normal. Follow the rules 👍👍👍💓🖤🧡🖤🧡🖤,My question is when does enforcement become harassment and intimidation? The COOP my son lives in has been visited 2 times already by the Purdue Police because of an anonymous report of large groups entering the house. On both occasions only the residents of the house were inside and they were all in full compliance of the rules. The police left without issue::: but felt the need to tell the guys that live there to be more vigilant if they didn't want them to keep coming back.,This should include going to bars. Just as unsafe as a party.,Purdue University::: have you considered testing every student at least once per week regardless of symptoms? A shut down of in-person class is going to be inevitable without it.,If you don’t enforce the rules why have them 🖤🧡🖤🧡🖤🧡. Boiler up,Counterrevoluti onary comrades who go against the pledge by not turning in their friends for having a good time face re-education,Thank you for adding the verbiage “correctly wearing a mask”. Proud to be a Purdue Alumni.,I’m totally sad for these students. Their Campus/college experience is limited in every single thing they do.,"Sometimes you just have to reach deep and ask yourself::: ""what's important?"" Maybe take a ""college break"" and wait a year to reenroll to see what happens. Suck it up::: you are not alone in what you're going through-\-\-\-\show how you can ""embrace the suck ( ask a soldier/former soldier what that means)-\-\-\-\show that you're tough enough to handle adversity and to be/become a Boilermaker. You will surprise yourself ! How quickly some have forgotten Tyler Trent.",Let’s have none of those IU party photos shit. We are better than they are. Let’s show what we’re made of.,What is Purdue’s take on local students who might go home for the weekend and not follow the rules?,I get there is a lot of disappointment and frustration. However::: we have never been through anything like this in our lifetime (unless you were alive in 1918) That being said everything is being done to try and keep kids safe. If it doesn’t work then things will be switched again! For people to say young people do not die is untrue. It’s a gamble unless you know for sure how your students body will handle the virus. The scary thing about Covid is that it is new and different symptoms keep popping up. Be upset::: be frustrated::: but how will you be if your child gets sick and is one of the unlucky ones?,Who is going to enforce this.,What ever happened about this? https:// www.google.com/ amp/s/ amp.jconline.com /amp/5551215002,BUT STILL SCARED TO PLAY FOOTBALL!!!!,How Can I find what the pledge says,Totally ridiculous my daughter had to make her Decision in July. In July all her classes were in person. Now all on line. She’ll be stuck in her room. So unfair she couldn’t stay home and take the classes. Wish I understood the reasoning behind this.,As a proud alumnus::: I am even prouder of how seriously they're taking this health issue. Kudos and Boiler Up!,Good. There must be teeth in PPP.,"Gives new meaning to ""hammer down""!",Do students really have to have a flu shot to attend?,I really want to see how they are going to monitor this and how they enforce it. I don't know what the right answer is. I am glad I don't have to deal with this. I feel badly for the freshmen that lost their senior year and now their college experience will be impacted. Boiler Up....stay safe.,So is Purdue going to do its part and remove junk food from campus??,Damn college kids. Y’all know how to make this work. Go Boilermakers!,At 43:::000 a year::: can they live without the alcohol for just 3 short months?? Possibly just focus on their careers they are so desperately working SO Damn hard for?? This is just temporary!!,I really hope students take this seriously. Being on campus is so special::: and it would be a shame to have to shut it down as soon as classes start.,New times. New measures.,say No to vaccination!!!. .. and this is in the same category as academic dishonesty::: possession and distribution of drugs::: and destruction of property?!,I was a little leary Friday dropping my son off seeing the mass of kids in line for the dining hall and nowhere near social distanced::: but on a positive note::: all the students were good at wearing masks. Hoping they all can stay healthy and still enjoy college life. They deserve it!!,Shame on you Purdue for subjecting students::: locals and professors to the possible spread of this disease. What’s worse is when the cases spike::: you’re sending these kids back to communities all over the country. Way to be a Covid Petri dish. I expected more as an alumnus than making a decision to force kids to school so you can collect room and board revenue. You think 18-22 year olds are going to act responsibly? Has your head been in the sand for the last few months?🤦🏻‍♂️,I am proud my daughter chose Purdue and I'm impressed with their decisions based on science NOT politics. Purdue Like all universities is doing the best they can under extreme circumstances. Obviously online courses while the students continue to live in the dorms is not the preferred scenario for anyone::: but I much prefer this scenario over other major universities that have gone fully remote and don’t offer students any opportunity to mix with their peers. I respect all opinions however I feel that Purdue needs our support now more than ever::: not negativity.,🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️,Kevin McManus,Mike Sheridan,Raven Rainey Alex Levi Myles Hudson could be good to be brought up,Amber Hopkins,Chloe Thiele,Madi Griegel,Tim Fingeroos,Smart. Thank you Purdue University for working hard to protect my freshman daughter!!!,Protect my grandson!,What a farce.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I think a lot more people have been exposed or carriers than reported,You REALLY think college kids are not going to pack bars::: house parties and frat parties? You are a special kind of naive. It doesn't matter if the schools do everything 150% correct.

Be safe & Boiler Up,Purdue should be completely remote::: and I’m really disappointed and embarrassed by a university that supposedly has some of the best STEM schools in the country::: rejects the advice of the country’s leading epidemiologists and health experts and opens campus. Especially as the virus surges around Indiana. I worry for the teachers::: staff::: students and their families. It’s a greedy::: reckless::: ill-informed decision that feels like a political statement. Why does the school insist on risking lives?,BOILER UP! 🖤💛🖤💛,I remember that time. Hot and humid.

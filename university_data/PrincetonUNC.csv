#TellUsTigers x #Thanksgiving: “Gratitude is hardly a big enough word to describe what I feel for Tony Whalen::: my close friend::: bandmate and collaborator for 27 years — until his death from COVID-19 on March 25::: 2020. If you knew him::: he was all about bigger and better. I can trace so many positive things in my life to Tony. Tony and I started three bands::: all with me on guitar and him on drums. Playing music and shows with him was some of the most fun I’ll ever have::: and I am eternally grateful for that. In the days and weeks after Tony died::: everyone I work with at Princeton Entrepreneurship Council (PEC)::: the Office of the Dean for Research and around campus lifted me up. I’m lucky to call these people friends and colleagues. PEC and Princeton Innovation put on a lot of virtual events in 2020::: and we were doing more working from home than even I thought possible. I’m grateful that the work I do at #PrincetonU contributes to making society better. Staying busy doing this important work has helped me to keep going during the pandemic and to process my own grief at losing Tony. He and I met the first week of college::: at @Rider_University in 1993. Tony was one of those people that you hope to have in your college life — he made everything more colorful and memorable. He was creative::: charismatic::: inspirational and hilariously inappropriate at times. Tony made Rider and our community there better. And he wanted the best for you::: even if you only knew him for five minutes. He was one of the first people who opened the door into my career in design. He commissioned me for a logo design in 1997 and from there::: we embarked on one creative project after another together. When Tony died::: I plunged into several creative projects to honor him. The biggest one was to produce ‘Tony Whalen: Legend and Legacy:::’ an hour-long documentary about the impact he had on Rider::: his friends and his family. It was an honor for me to keep his spirit and memory alive. Although he’s gone::: Tony can still be with us if I can make things around me better too.” — Wright Seneres::: social media/marketing specialist::: Princeton Entrepreneurship Council; photo by Alexander Moravcsik ’23 #Princetagram,2021-11-25 15:08:25,This is very grrat.

#TellUsTigers: “As we sat in after-school traffic in Morelia::: México::: my mom used to play CDs of popular Latin American folk music. She shared her favorite boleros and explained how certain art songs became national treasures in their home country. She’d tell me: ‘You should sing these pieces someday.’ I grew up with a deep love for Latin American music and its power to move audiences across México. Whether performed in concert halls or a tiny living room packed with family::: I felt incredibly proud of this rich musical tradition that I shared with my parents and abuelitos. As I grew up studying classical music::: I felt that Latin American folk and popular music was not given enough of a platform. Today::: as a conductor and vocalist::: I’m dedicated to sharing songs and soundscapes from the Latin American canon with orchestral and choral ensembles. While I was a student at #PrincetonU::: I conducted @princetoncamerata in a concert of classical Mexican repertoire; it brought me immense joy to share music I loved since I was a kid with my peers and the community. I also conducted a beloved bolero with the Princeton Glee Club in Mexico City in Feb. 2020. These heartwarming experiences intensified my drive to create spaces for this repertoire to be performed by folks who grew up with these songs::: the way I did::: as well as singers who’d never heard of them before. This fall::: my dream of starting a new choir::: Alegría::: has become a reality with support from Glee Club director Gabriel Crouch and the Glee Club community. Its mission is to perform works by Latinx composers and Latin American folk music arranged for full choir. The piece we’re rehearsing in this video::: ‘Fina Estampa:::’ is an Afro-Peruvian waltz written by Chabuca Granda. It tells the story of an animated sidewalk that awakens from the splendor of a beautiful person strolling by.” — Mariana Corichi Gómez ’21::: choral & Trenton Arts at Princeton associate.

#TellUsTigers: “As a woman of color who designs and sews historical costumes::: I don’t often see people like myself represented. I try to be mindful about who I ask to model my costumes::: so that I can increase the diversity of BIPOC images in the community. I’m excited about the Afrofuturist idea of taking parts of different histories::: stories and symbols and rewriting them through costuming to create a new narrative or work of art. I designed the costume I’m wearing here based on the character Winter Hayle-Blackburn from my favorite book series in middle school::: ‘The Lunar Chronicles’ by Marissa Meyer::: YA Author. Winter is the princess of Luna and proudly wears three scars down the side of her face as proof of her refusal to succumb to the wishes of her cruel stepmother Queen Levana. Most of the YA books I read back then had white protagonists::: so to find a character who I admired so much::: who was also not only Black but had a mixed racial identity::: meant the world to me! My design draws inspiration from Greek chitons — a tunic that fastens at the shoulder — and the drape of sari garments to highlight the cultural influences of both Winter’s home of Luna and her late mother. I’ve been sewing since I was 6 years old::: but I got into historical costuming in high school. I lean towards historical fantasy/historically inspired work rather than historical reproduction because it gives me freedom to counter the lack of mainstream BIPOC images in these eras. For example::: I might photograph myself in a buttoned-up 1910s European gown with my natural hair out and unstyled::: the focus being the natural contrast between these images or symbols. As a co-leader of Trenton Youth Theater (Trenton Arts at Princeton) at #PrincetonU last year::: I taught a couple of costume design workshops. I drew on the show ‘Natasha Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812:::’ one of my favorite examples of historical costume in theater. Hearing the students dissect & offer their opinions on a work I had admired for so long was exciting. I can't wait to be back on campus with other artists to collaborate and make art together!” — Tanaka Ngwara ’24; 📷 by Ella Claire Morgan ’24 #Princetagram,2021-08-08 15:38:05,Ms. Ngwara is amazing and I look forward to following her career.,Clya Mitztoo,Congratulations,after all the black-centric acronyms::: it's only white dresses. lol. talk about cultural appropriation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Scientists from #PrincetonU::: Allen Institute and Baylor College of Medicine have just released a collection data that marries a 3D wiring diagram with the function of tens of thousands of neurons — creating the most detailed examination of mammalian brain circuitry to date.  PRINCETON.EDU Scientists unveil brain wiring diagram with 200:::000 cells and half a billion connections,2021-08-06 15:49:10,DOOMSDAY::: SCIENCE AND NATURE  The universal run is on auto mode and may not be based merely on calculations looking to its vast range. It is purely inter dependence of matter in any form resulting in action and reaction equally::: but in visible and invisible output::: the latter is beyond science. The nature is supreme controlling::: balancing billions of stars::: planets and galaxies in the universe. Like different objects in the known universe there is a possibility of universal line ups well systematized. Majority of action is unknown. Could be the equal format of visible action and reaction output would be the same in the invisible to be absorbed in the natural process. Dark matter::: dark energy and normal matter are nothing but matter energy::: later resulting in gravitation::: anti-gravitatio n and recent anticipated gravitation ripples. In fact ripples are constant out of the universal function::: at the most may be a part of harmonious waves (developed at the time of universal birth simultaneously with series of bangs instead of a single bang). So all ripples can be bracketed as universal ripples helping to create or destroy energy and also in development of new objects::: shining or otherwise::: rotating or static. Environment disturbances varying from object to object create imbalance::: hitting on the life. The imbalance by the nature is turned ineffective so as not to cross the permissible limit by the absorption capacity::: being part of the overall scenario. Manmade pollution is of multiple facets and its impact is instant on living and non- living too. It is certain that objects bearing different strengths::: rotating or static carry peculiar ingredients; to give an example of the sun::: moon and earth; the first shining::: the second deriving sunlight and the third earth::: not like either. Matter is in particles and transforms into solid::: liquid and waves (space). Since pollution effect is on perennial path it speaks on fast ageing; in the process decomposing the original structure::: on which the earth placement::: rotation velocity was initially generated. Thus the earth may be out of the natural universal rhythm to face unforeseen hurdles. The immediate result will be that day and night timings will be derailed. Further the earth like an aero plane carrying living and nonliving as passengers on board with one time departure on the nonstop run::: would wobble due to change in structural design and climate::: the reason being pollution. Another critical man made crisis due to imbalance is even the natural elements will deny responding to the proved discovery formulas for the desired output.  Whatever it may be::: there would not be any doomsday. The earth might automatically push up or down in space depending upon universal ripples of gravitation and anti- gravitation elements prevailing and then get close or merged with other object of similar characteristics . Since there are infinite objects::: similar pattern formations cannot be denied. In view of the safe run::: no danger  2  Is anticipated. However this eventuality can be delayed to a major extent by pollution control.  The natural ageing of the earth with environment care is bound to be adjusted with accuracy by the universe; but not the forced ageing caused by pollution. Though the nature would not cause any doomsday for the earth due to time bound action of universal ripples::: it is absolutely necessary to stop pollution. It would not be strange that the natural pollution free switchover of the earth will be adjacent to another living object by the universal supreme energy. Science is powered by the nature. Standing on the shoulders of the nature let us love the mother earth and progress with scientific bend without any pollution. Discoveries to substitute the existing natural benefits for immediate laptop comforts need to be reconsidered. In short it is high time to get tuned with the natural process.

#TellUsTigers x #Princetalove: “Last summer::: I photographed my Princeton classmates La Lee Lo and My (pronounced ‘me’) Bui::: the beautiful couple in these photos::: for their wedding::: a multi-ceremony celebration of Vietnamese::: Hmong and Catholic cultures. Their celebration also reflected their story of meeting as first-generation::: lower-income students at Princeton who are now building a life together back in their hometown of St. Paul::: Minnesota. I wrote about them for Portrait of a Young Couple::: a photojournalism project I founded to photograph couples’ weddings for free in exchange for hosting me in their home and permission to tell their story to the wider world. (You can see me standing with La Lee and My in the photo in front of My’s mother’s home.) When I graduated from #PrincetonU::: photography was still just a hobby of mine. I studied electrical engineering and felt obligated to spend some time after graduation working in the field. But something was missing::: and I soon realized how my hobby in photography gave me something my job in engineering never could: a reason to spend time with anyone I met in life. At Princeton::: everyone needed a nice photo of themselves at some point; dancers::: actors::: musicians::: academics; on stages::: in labs::: standing proudly in front of Nassau Hall with their senior theses. With my camera::: I had reason to spend time with all these incredible people. That idea stayed with me::: along with a question: if my camera afforded so many relationships at Princeton::: how many more could it afford across the world? My answer was Portrait of a Young Couple. Weddings are one of the few celebrations common across all peoples::: no matter their ethnicity::: religion::: political views::: career or socioeconomic status. Photography is one of the most important and intimate jobs at a wedding::: and so it naturally presents a rare and authentic opportunity to document a couple’s story. I’ve photographed 30 weddings for the project so far::: and I hope to begin traveling internationally next year to document the stories of countless more people.” — Vincent Po '18,2021-07-11 14:44:35,i am from viet nam..beautiful !!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

#TellUsTigers: “What only my closest friends can guess from the constant murmur of humming::: whistling and soft singing they hear when around me is that I always have music playing in my head. The ‘Allegro assai’ from Bach’s Sonata no. 3 for solo violin that I’m playing in this video is frequently the background music for my life::: every note following in perfect perpetual motion even as every day does anything but. As coach of the first violin section of the Trenton Youth Orchestra::: directed by the incredible Lou Chen ’19::: my favorite thing to do was to have everyone sing their part. You can practice violin every waking hour::: and you will never progress as much as you would from singing for just five minutes. One of the things I’m most grateful for at Princeton is learning from so many amazing musicians — from rehearsals with my friends in Princeton University Orchestra and Princeton Camerata to special moments such as playing in chamber groups::: touring with the orchestra across Spain and performing Mendelssohn’s ‘A Midsummer Night’s Dream’ under the baton of the legendary Gustavo Dudamel during his #PrincetonU residency. These musical role models sculpted the way I think::: sing and breathe. It felt like a true coming-of-age moment when I started noticing myself quoting my teachers and mentors while I coached TYO sectionals. During the pandemic::: I spent a lot of time reflecting on my life at Princeton: I realized the most formative things I’ve done could only have happened here. I never seriously thought about studying violin at a conservatory::: but I suspect that even if I had::: my relationship with music wouldn’t be half as meaningful as it is today. Every day brought endless serendipity::: musical or otherwise::: and I was always happiest when I stumbled upon the newest thing Princeton had to offer.

"#TellUsTigersPartII: ""I submitted my medical school applications soon after my 2020 ‘couch graduation’ from Princeton::: courtesy of the pandemic. The next weekend::: I moved to New York to pursue my dream of starting the first luxury fashion brand for women of color. I’ve always known I was destined to pursue multiple passions. Shadowing a C-section in a small Louisiana Army hospital at age 13::: where my mother was a nurse::: inspired my medical journey. Starting Tiger Trends::: the first fashion editorial at #PrincetonU as a sophomore (when I was first featured in #TellUsTigers) ignited my love of fashion. While fashion and medicine seemingly have little in common::: both must improve one element: equity. As a Black female anesthesiologist::: I plan to address important discrepancies in healthcare for people of color that result in disproportionately high mortality rates for new mothers::: a struggle to find effective mental health resources and more. As a Black female designer::: I will use my fashion brand pAx to celebrate the versatility of women within the WOC community::: showcasing beauty that lies outside the Eurocentric standard::: an unrealistic standard that has dominated the fashion industry too long. We source our materials from Black and brown-owned businesses — including the white fabric of the skirt I designed and am wearing here with a bodice top from Vaquera; and the cotton in our classic tee::: in the second photo. We work exclusively with POC creatives — this includes photographers::: hairstylists::: seamstresses and more. Our executive team is entirely comprised of women of color. Over time::: I’ll develop pAx into the next luxury conglomerate like LVMH::: but one that acquires and supports other designers and brands that amplify POC talent. Last week::: pAx finished our SS22 collection. This weekend::: I’m moving to DC to attend Howard University College of Medicine. I don’t anticipate that accomplishing both my goals will be easy but the best things usually aren’t. I often joke that I feel like a double agent::: but I wouldn’t have it any other way.” — Sara Howell ’20; 📷 by David Kelly Crow #Princetagram",2021-06-13 14:26:05,Bravo!

"#TellUsTigers x #WellnessWednesday: ""On June 1::: I got my second vaccine shot. It was a bittersweet day for me — I lost my oldest son Josh in August 2012 from a heroin overdose and June 1 is his birthday. He would have been 35. But I felt more comfortable with the vaccine::: knowing my son would protect me. At the onset of the pandemic::: I really wasn’t worried. After all it was only supposed to be for two weeks. As time went on::: I started to worry about my mom::: who is 73 and has health issues. #COVID19 could really affect her. I have been unable to give her a hug or kiss this whole time. Luckily::: neither she nor my stepfather got the virus. They isolated themselves from everyone. Canceled Easter dinner in 2020. I would talk with my mom on the phone regularly. She would let me see her from time to time::: as long as I wore a mask & kept my distance. She only allowed this because I was part of the University’s weekly testing program. She canceled Thanksgiving. My two sons::: who are 33 and 28::: were very upset::: so I made Thanksgiving for us. At Christmas we went to my mom’s::: but sadly only for about an hour to exchange gifts. There was no food or drink::: we had to wear masks and socially distance. Still no hugs or kisses. When the vaccine first became available::: I was wary like many people. My mom::: stepfather::: sister and brother-in-law all received the Moderna vaccine and had minimal side effects. My mom asked me a million times to get vaccinated. Then a good friend who also works at Princeton told me the Pfizer vaccine was available at the University and asked if I would go with them. I called my doctor to see if it was ok. I had a minor case of COVID in March 2021. On May 11::: my doctor gave me the green light::: and my friend and I received our first shot later that day. On June 15::: it will be two weeks after my second shot::: and I’m going to my mom’s to give her the biggest hug and kiss. I can’t wait! I feel good that I am protecting my family and my co-workers.

"#TellUsTigers: “My father never finished high school::: nor his father before him::: but both he and my mother sacrificed to ensure that cycle would be broken. I was always taught to cherish my education. From an early age::: I understood that education is a right that was not always granted to people like me. My father::: Greg::: unfortunately::: passed away this August due to complications of COVID-19. One of the last conversations I had with him was telling him that I had been accepted into Harvard Law School. That was three days before he was admitted into the hospital. He sounded quieter that day but I didn’t understand why until much later. He had always told my mother::: ‘I want to see him get his first degree.’ My dad realized that education::: formal or otherwise::: is something you must take and keep a hold of because it’s what gives you power in this world. Most importantly::: my father taught me that on my quest to achieve excellence::: I should care for people along my path and strive to leave the world better than the one I was born into. To that end::: I think my professional decision to attend law school is the biggest one I’ve made so far. [Social justice] played a huge role. In my law school personal statement::: I tied together references from ‘Changes’ by Tupac and excerpts from Ta-Nehisi Coates’ book::: “Between the World and Me:::"" because they remind me that although it’s so easy to get pessimistic about the world::: we shouldn’t sulk or give up. As a lawyer::: I want to be someone who helps reform and improve some of our oldest institutions and systems. If society is like a big machine::: then lawyers are the people who read the blueprints to that machine as they decipher and help change laws to ensure things run smoothly. Those who came before me fought and sacrificed to leave me a better world. In keeping with the lessons from my parents::: and in using everything I have learned in my four years at #PrincetonU::: I hope to do the same by continually serving others.” — G. Terrell Seabrooks ’21::: Spirit of Princeton award winner. This narrative is adapted from a U.S. Lacrosse magazine profile.

In a letter to the Princeton University community::: President Eisgruber shares plans to have a fully residential fall semester::: in-person teaching and learning and a normal academic calendar. We are requiring all students to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19::: and to provide proof of vaccination by August 1::: 2021::: in order to enroll for the fall semester. The University is considering ways to increase vaccination rates across campus::: including a potential vaccination requirement for faculty and staff. For now::: we are asking everyone who works at Princeton to get vaccinated as soon as possible and to upload their vaccination status to VacStatus.  PRINCETON.EDU President Eisgruber’s message to the University community about fall 2021,2021-05-20 17:47:44,I hope you’ll consider once again allowing visitors to use your libraries. With proof of vaccination and taking all the necessary precautions::: of course.,Thank you for working so tirelessly to make this a reality. My daughter can’t wait to start at Princeton in August! She had been vaccinated -as have all her family- and we are ready to enjoy the beauty of Princeton’s campus! Would love to visit prior as well. Thank you again.,I read this letter with tears in my eyes during my lunch break on a 12 hour shift as a vaccine nurse. Trust me::: I was inspired to vaccinate more patients::: mostly 12-18 year olds::: all afternoon. I held thoughts of all of our children’s futures in my heart as I jabbed away. Thank you::: Princeton University::: for bringing your community back together and encouraging everyone to get vaccinated. It is the way forward. 🧡,Wonderful news! I’m so excited for my daughter to start her Princeton experience. 🧡,Hoping you allow in person tours for prospective students this summer with proof of vaccination.,When are we allowed for campus visit?

#Princeton21 Commencement celebrated the achievements of a remarkable group of graduates and reflected on the challenges of the last 14 months. 🎓  PRINCETON.EDU Princeton’s 2021 Commencement marks occasion to celebrate achievements and reflect on challenges of last year,2021-05-16 22:27:04,Well organized and executed. That day will live in our memories forever.,The future is bright!,It’s a great place... love it!,PRINCETON CLASSICS Dept. doesn't require ancient Greek and Latin!!! is this a joke??? This is a serious accreditation issue to the point that Princeton becomes a diploma mill!!! Slavery against other races has nothing to do with ancient Greeks. Ancient Greeks had other Greeks and captives of war as slaves. They only had trade with Black sub-Sacharan Africa. There are vases in the shape of a Black African and they were fascinated with exotica the same way modern Greeks venerate and adore Michael Jackson::: Sackil O'Neel::: Michael Jordan::: and Yianni Atentokumbo. Alexander the Great treated the Indians with respect::: as it is evident in the historiography of his encounters with Chandra Gupta::: the Paruava king Porus::: and the Gymnosophists or Indian gurus/ philosophers. Even the Romans didn't have many black Africans as slaves and instead::: they had only a few South/ Central Asians. Removing Ancient Greek and Latin from Classics is not a way to combat racism. It's a way to combat arts and humanities creating new generations of semi-literate and semi-educated con-artists::: pseudo-scholars who will be classicists without mastering classics. That is classics by definition are Ancient Greek and Latin! Classical means related to the ancient Greeks and Romans who spoke Latin! Removing ancient Greek and Latin from Classics it's like you make pastichio without pasta and Bessamel or you make a meat Lasagna without pasta! But Lasagna is pasta! And pastichio is pasta::: as its name suggests! So these ridiculous illiterate propagandists are making clowns out of themselves by trying to convince that there are doing this irrational and inept move to fight racism! It's crystal clear they want to fight Western arts and humanities and give away degrees to people who don't deserve it since they want to be classicists without mastering classical languages!!! Then::: Princeton is nothing but a Diploma Mill and should lose accreditation!! ! https:// greekreporter.co m/2021/05/31/ princeton-remove s-greek-latin-f or-classics-maj ors-to-combat-r acism/ ?fbclid=IwAR0XJm MwlfpZhpk7CZ_rR OT7ujYUsWjx2-su 6qSZeJb3u4jPN13 lXDr_7tU,Ober Mañaccasa Sallo,🎉🏅❤️,<3,Pretty stupid to be a University...,Listen to any book you like::: in full audio.

"At Princeton’s virtual Class Day ceremony::: author::: comedian and host of The Daily Show Trevor Noah urged seniors to foster friendships that create ""home"" wherever they are::: to travel to challenge their worldview and to not let the lessons of compassion learned in the pandemic recede into history.  PRINCETON.EDU Trevor Noah on Class Day: Comedy can poke holes in society ‘and reveal some of the light that comes through’",2021-05-16 01:02:03,Kindly enlightening Trevor Noah and all others who complain about a “lack of equality in force applied”. A short history lesson: I remember times where there was more of an “equal force”: it’s called the 90s and back then Israeli kids::: women::: and men got blown up by the dozens in Israeli city buses every week. The difference nowadays is that due to security walls and the iron dome::: hamas cannot fully carry out its vicious plans. So you’re right::: those were obviously better times and the Middle East was a more just place::: with more Israeli people dead,An open letter to Trevor Noah:  MAY 14::: 2021::: 12:24 AM  I just watched your 10-minute monologue on the Israeli-Hamas conflict for your popular television program “The Daily Show” (May 11).  Frankly::: it wasn’t easy viewing. In fact::: I began talking back to the screen::: but::: obviously::: to no avail::: so I chose instead to write you this open letter.  You framed your comments quite cleverly by suggesting there were competing narratives out there::: depending on who was doing the talking and the starting point of their version of history.  And then::: as if nothing more than a curious third party::: you waded into the debate::: essentially assigning yourself a certain moral credibility because of your “non-combatant“ status.  But we are not entirely in a post-truth society yet::: at least I hope not::: where facts no longer exist and opinions rule the day::: especially when catapulted into the public square by celebrity status and legions of admiring followers.  So::: for example::: when you assert that the British took the land from the Palestinians::: not quite.  Actually::: the British took the land from the Ottoman Turks::: who had ruled there for centuries. Palestinians never had a sovereign state of their own. The Jews did::: by the way::: though that was vanquished by the Romans nearly 2:::000 years ago.  But to fast forward::: this conflict::: at its heart::: is about two competing national movements::: and the only logical way to resolve it is by a negotiated settlement — two states for two peoples.  Simpler said than done::: of course::: and here we come to demonstrable facts::: not simply personal opinions.  The UN recommended precisely such a two-state settlement as early as 1947. It was accepted by the Jews::: rejected by the Arabs.  From 1948 to 1967::: the West Bank::: eastern Jerusalem::: and Gaza were all in Arab::: not Jewish::: hands. A Palestinian state could have been created at any time. It wasn’t.  During 2000-1::: Israel::: joined by President Bill Clinton::: offered a viable two-state accord to the Palestinians (incidentally::: one of several offers in the past 20 years). They refused. That’s not my conclusion::: but Clinton’s::: as described in his autobiography::: “My Life.”  Then we come to 2005::: which has direct relevance to your monologue. Israel unilaterally withdrew its forces and settlers from Gaza::: giving local residents their first chance in history to govern themselves::: something Ottoman Turkey and Egypt had never done. By 2007::: the Palestinian Authority was violently ousted and Hamas took control. It has wielded power ruthlessly ever since.  What exactly is Hamas::: a point you skipped in your take on the Middle East?  It is a terrorist organization. That’s not a personal view. It is the formal designation of the United States and the 27-member European Union.  What’s the goal of Hamas::: again missing from your comments? Israel’s annihilation and replacement by an Islamist regime. Those are frequently expressed and well-documented sentiments of Hamas leaders.  So you skip these relevant facts — the violent nature of Hamas::: its doctrinal aims::: or::: for that matter::: its split with the Palestinian Authority — and zero in on the current round of conflict::: looking at it::: above all::: from the perspective of power ratios.  You bemoan the imbalance::: asserting it’s not a “fair fight” because Israel is the stronger party.  You compare casualties::: simplistically suggesting the side with the higher number is somehow automatically granted victim status.  You even try to offer a rationale for the Hamas actions by referring to threatened evictions of four Palestinian families in Jerusalem::: failing to note that this is a longstanding legal issue in the Israeli court system.  You suggest that Israel triggered Hamas’s ire by harassing Muslims during Ramadan::: which is a total misrepresentati on of the facts::: not to mention that Israel has repeatedly gone to great lengths to protect the right of worship for all faiths — something quite rare in that part of the world.  Let’s be clear: Hamas’s ire for Israel is permanent::: as is its goal of one day dominating Palestinian allegiances not only in Gaza::: but in eastern Jerusalem and the West Bank::: as part of its larger strategy.  And you even try to compare the situation to your own childhood::: recalling that your mother told you not to hit your younger siblings::: even when provoked::: because you were bigger and stronger.  Sorry::: but your younger siblings were not plotting murder and wreaking societal havoc. You’re ignoring the true nature of Hamas::: the fact that it’s been firing 1000s of missiles over the years::: building cross-border terror tunnels::: kidnapping Israelis::: and foregoing development in Gaza to focus on damaging Israel.  You’re downplaying the trauma of millions of Israelis rushing to bomb shelters::: caring for the elderly and disabled::: and comforting traumatized children::: as rockets fly overhead today and could strike anywhere::: even with the Iron Dome anti-missile system in place.  You’re laudably concerned about children::: but are neglecting the instrumentaliza tion of Palestinian kids at the hands of a cynical Hamas regime that knows images of young victims will change the entire story for those who only see the photos::: not the context.  And you sidestep a key question — what is Israel supposed to do under such circumstances::: when your mother’s advice to you seems totally detached from the sober reality it faces? What would any country do::: when the traditional tools of diplomacy — from conflict management to conflict resolution — don’t stand a chance with an ideologically and theologically driven Hamas?  Finally::: allow me to stress one point. I don’t view this conflict simply as an endless debate to prove one side right and the other side wrong. Not at all. Rather::: my decades-long involvement in the region::: my many trips to Israel and the Arab world::: including Palestinian territories::: has one central dream — peace::: enduring peace.  I believe that to be the quest of the vast majority of Israelis::: among them my and my wife’s close family members. They have not experienced a single day of true peace since 1948::: nor their families who were survivors of the Holocaust::: refugees from communism::: or victims of evictions from Arab countries.  Israel was not reborn to be in permanent conflict. The fact that six Arab countries now have normalized ties with Israel is a powerful reminder that peace is attainable::: and that Israel is keenly on the lookout for partners.  One day::: that peace will be realized::: I pray::: with the Palestinians. But it won’t happen as long as Hamas rules Gaza::: clings to its genocidal goals::: and snookers well-meaning people abroad to believe it’s the victim in a conflict::: alas::: of its own making.

"#TellUsTigers: ""My first book::: ‘Every Day the River Changes:::’ will soon be published by Catapult::: and I can’t help but think about how it all began — as my #SeniorThesis. My project was different than most: Princeton::: being the magical place it is::: had agreed to send me to Colombia::: where I would travel the entire thousand-mile length of the country’s legendary Río Magdalena and write about the people I met living by its banks. That’s how I got to know folks like Don Pira::: the older man pictured beside me. He lived alone on a patch of riverside land and supported himself by fishing and picking plantains day after day in the sweltering heat. I’ll never forget our journey to reach him::: an hour’s canoe ride through wetlands and flat pastures. The rising sun gave light to river turtles slipping off logs and red howler monkeys stirring in the guadua trees. The only wild and invasive hippopotamuses living outside Africa wallowed in our midst. Don Pira told me one of them had chased him off his land recently. Encounters like these filled the pages of my notebook::: and soon I realized I had a much bigger story on my hands. Colombia is one of the most complex and fascinating places I’ve ever reported from::: ‘Every Day the River Changes’ is a portrait of the nation as it recovers from more than half a century of conflict::: told through a tale of lively adventure along a majestic river now at risk. By featuring local voices::: I hope this book will foster a more nuanced understanding of an often-misunderstood country. Since graduating from #PrincetonU in 2019::: I’ve been freelancing as a journalist::: writing about people and nature for @natgeo::: @nytimes and more. That’s what I think travel writing can do in today's world: encourage empathy across cultures near and far. With my first book on the way::: I’m just getting started::: but I can’t help but hope to be a voice leading that charge for my generation someday. Wandering the world in search of stories is a dream come true for me. I invite you to follow me for more stories from across the globe. I can’t wait to have you along for the ride."" — Jordan Salama '19 #Princetagram #TellUsTigersPartII #EveryDayTheRiverChanges",2021-04-18 14:24:06,how amazing and best of luck to you in the future,Congratulations !

Today::: Princeton University and Ludwig Cancer Research have announced the launch of the Ludwig Princeton Branch::: dedicated to the study of cancer metabolism and its promise for new and better ways to prevent and treat cancer. The branch in Princeton will be the first Ludwig location to focus on cancer metabolism.  PRINCETON.EDU Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research and Princeton University partner to ‘push the frontiers’ on diet::: metabolism and cancer,2021-04-13 12:59:35,💚,Removing the trigger points in the lungs we can help to treat flu::: flu A::: cough::: asthma::: bronchitis::: pneumonitis::: COPD::: chest pain::: difficulty breathing::: tonsillitis::: rhinitis::: lungs::: flu complication.  Keys is in flu::: Keto flu::: seasonal flu (too weak to have the health follow the change of weather). Fat men on Keto diet may have symtoms like the flu::: it is not caused by virus::: but by the cells and organs hunger for the energy from glucose and the body not yet adapt to digest lipid for energy. All of these symptoms of flu like symptoms of Keto diet can be removed immediately with a glass of sugar or sweet milk.  Immune system::: forgotten health problems::: self healing::: simple nutriotion and simple Qigong excercise::: Qigong breathing to boost the health and sefl removing forgotten trigger points.  From the epidemiology of COVID-19::: most fatal cases have many other chronic health problems like problems in cardiovascular. If they have cardio problems and vascular problems::: I see the health of the heart has an impact on the health of the lungs.  Do covid-19 and flu virus reveal that too many people have forgotten::: untreated problems in systemic vasculars/ cardiovasculars?  Some of its drugs caused Coughing because the lungs contain lots of veins! Test by slightly punching/ clapping on the back.  The lungs also have lots of veins::: tiny veins::: which are the basic structure of the lungs - the proof is a kind of drug for high blood pressure treatment has impacts on veins have side effects is coughing. It means that the patients who have cardiovascular diseases also have lung problems. By clapping or punching::: we can find it out.  The cases of re-affirmed positive after recovering of treatment it makes me doubt if there is effective vaccine.  Clapping removes trigger points in the lungs::: removing the stiffness or rigidity of the vessels::: cells in the lungs. Make blood circulate well in the lungs which helps the white blood cells to kill bacteria better. On the other hand::: when the lungs are clear::: it can take more oxygen and make people feel better::: and stop the difficult breathings.  Cough is the body reflex when having some problems or stuck in the lungs::: the body tries to throw it out by coughing. Punching on the back makes them have great relief. We may call stuck::: dust::: phlegms::: constriction of vessels in the lungs as trigger points. If there are too many trigger points in the lungs::: patients will feel healthier in the chest::: and difficult breathing. Punching by hands::: clubs or rubber hammer quickly and slightly and not create pain::: will make the lungs clear::: it will make the lungs vibrate to loosen the trigger points and remove it. It makes lung cells healthier and recovers better and facilitates the blood cells to kills the virus. Ask others to do it::: or if not::: can self do it. It is like a massage for lungs::: very safe. And much more effective::: much more simple than postural drainage. This is why all can do it::: test it and feel the results immediately. https:// youtu.be/ KSTiemuMjnY  Aim of all therapies should make blood pressure at 120 -130 /80/75 or around it. And the glycemia at 6.0 when hunger and 70 - 9.0 when full. Warm hands::: feet::: and no trigger points in the body. Right eating::: exercise and Qigong make body sweating and warm body. By clapping::: we can remove all trigger points in the body. When clap or slight punch on the body::: we can feel the trigger points because of strange feelings of pain::: numbness. Do it until you feel roughness or normal feelings.  Boost the lungs. to the illness caused by the virus::: there is no medicine. But the health of the individuals makes a great difference. There is no medicine for these diseases. But right eating and exercise is the best advice for all. This is an exercise for lungs & removing trigger points  We can use hands or rubber hammer to punch or clap on the back. You may feel like this is similar to postural drainage. No::: this is better. The postural drainage technique makes patients feel lots of roughness on the back but does not make the lungs vibrate much. Punching on the back makes the whole lungs vibrate::: this will make patients breathe easier. Do this in the right degree can be seen as a massage for the lungs to boost the health of the lungs.  To know how much the vibration of the vessels and cells in the lungs::: just quickly punching on the table::: and see the vibrations of dust and objects on the table. If we can punch with a quick rhythm::: we can make the lungs vibrate most with the little effort. The more we do for patients::: the better the patients feel.  On the other hand::: removing trigger points in the lungs can boost the health of the lungs::: supply well oxygens for all important organs and the whole body in critical situations.  Quickly and slightly punch on the back under which there are the lungs::: if there are places that the patients feel hurt::: pain::: breathlessness::: causing the coughing or feel comfortable these are the trigger points which can make t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To learn more: https://bit.ly/3cEKEMU,2021-03-17 18:19:23,Thank you for speaking up and supporting AAPI community. Hate crimes against our community are serious. Most of incidents took place against women. Our fears are real. Stop making excuses or rebranding it as economic anxiety or sexual addiction. We must call evil by its name.,Stop Violence against Asians!! We need to know why people hate asian. Coronavirus? There's rumor many Korean-American s purchased the leaked testing content and Korean-American sell the leaked testing content to Chinese and Asian communities. Asian-American testing score is very high. We need to investigate why Top Universities accept too many Asian-Americans . If Top Universities(Pr inceton::: etc) continue accepting too many Asian-Americans (Asian in US is less than 7% vs Asian in Top Universities are 20-40%)::: Other races such as Black & Latino students will lose opportunities to study in College. Asian students earn higher GPA scores compared to their Black & Latino peers because many Asian Parents spent a lot of money for tutoring their kids. I think Standardized tests and GPA unfairly favor Asian-American students in college admissions. I found many Black & Latino families can’t afford prep courses and tutoring services. Higher GPA increase their chances of getting into a university and winning scholarships. http:// m.koreaherald.co m/ view.php?ud=2020 1027000800&ACE_ SEARCH=1,Dear Princeton: UPenn has opened up its AAPI Restorative Practice Circles to alumni.

#TellUsTigers x #Princetalove x #ValentineDay: “The first time I met Wendy::: we had just sat down next to each other in the first class of our Freshman Seminar::: ‘Can Virtue Be Taught? An Introduction to the Liberal Arts:::’ which was also our first Princeton class ever. As an icebreaker::: the professor asked us each to talk about the things we were passionate about. Wendy went first and spoke about her love for music and tennis; this made me somewhat uncomfortable::: because I had to go second::: and the only things I had in mind were music and tennis. The first words I ever spoke in a #PrincetonU classroom will forever be repeating exactly what the pretty girl next to me had just said — although Wendy swears that she never thought anything of it. That would turn out to be the only class we’d ever take together. (Wendy got a significantly better grade than I did. I’m totally over it::: though. Honestly. I rarely think about it::: and it almost never comes up in casual conversation). We hit it off immediately that day::: bonding over our mutual interests (which I was perhaps too eager to prove were genuine) on our long hike back to the Forbes addition::: where we both happened to live. For over a year we remained just friends::: until I finally came to my senses and asked her out on our first date: lunch plans at Teresa’s::: which turned into 3pm Panera Bread when we both overslept. A month later::: on Dec. 6::: 2012::: Wendy asked me to ask her to be my girlfriend. (I had no idea I was supposed to ask. I swear I’m not as clueless in other parts of my life.) And exactly eight years after that::: through years of long distance and slow dances in dorm rooms and presidencies of rival Asian culture clubs and anniversary Panera dates and extremely rainy graduation ceremonies and new careers and a wedding postponement due to the global #COVID19 pandemic::: we came back to where it all started::: getting married on Dec. 6::: 2020::: by our close friend::: classmate::: and officiant Vivian Qin on the steps of Blair Arch — the same steps we once walked on our way back to Forbes::: talking about music and tennis.” — Brandon Shih '15::: with Wendy Gu '15; wedding photo by Sophie Kaye Photography,2021-02-14 14:49:31,Christina Luo Jonica Mong hffhhfhf im soft,What a beautiful story.

But I was spellbound by the way we mourn. I witnessed the electricity and elegance of Black grief. The adorned body laid out in an open casket. Elders dressed in their Sunday best telling stories of the good ol’ days. Teenagers with a classmate’s face emblazoned on R.I.P. T-shirts. A spirited eulogy followed by a festive repast where soul food is served and family drama unfolds. A ritual of death transformed into a celebration of life. It was the germ that grew into my scholarly work. My interest in African American mourning and social justice movements began in August 2014. Two months after graduating from Princeton Seminary::: I travelled to Ferguson::: Missouri to protest the shooting death of Michael Brown at the hands of white police officer Darren Wilson. I was fascinated by how Brown’s memorial was an epicenter of protest activity. At Princeton::: I was eager to make sense of my experiences in Ferguson and my family’s funeral parlor. Ironically::: as I began studying African American mourning::: I experienced a spell of personal loss. Within eight months::: my family buried my father and brother. It was the hardest year of my life. I was debilitated by grief. But thanks to the support of my loved ones and my advisers::: professors Eddie Glaude and Imani Perry::: I am completing my dissertation. The spirit of my brother and father::: and the deep abiding love of my mother::: continue to guide me along this exciting journey. More than anything::: I want to make them proud and carry on the legacy that made me and my work possible.” — Nyle Fort::: graduate student in religion and interdisciplinary humanities with a concentration in African American studies #Princetagram,2021-02-07 14:39:04,What is personal is your power::: hold on to it::: drive it and let it also take you to unexpected places.

In view of ongoing concerns related to the pandemic::: Reunions and the postponed Commencement ceremony for the Class of 2020 will not take place on campus this spring. The University has determined that inviting alumni back to campus from around the world is not prudent or possible. Reunions will be held as a virtual event this May. The University is working with the Class of 2020 to find ways to honor their achievements. The University has not yet made a decision regarding Commencement for the Class of 2021 and related end-of-year activities. Emails have been sent to the Class of 2020 and Class of 2021 as well as the alumni community with additional details.,2021-02-01 19:46:06,As sad as this makes me feel::: it makes complete sense. Stay safe::: everyone! We can pull through this together <3 🐯,"Kathy Hovsmith My Class of '20 daughter is so sad & frustrated. I am::: too. Rationally::: we can see why another postponement would be needed thru this spring's Covid complications. But it's emotionally devastating to hear the Class of 2020 will NEVER be given an on-campus graduation experience (because by 2022::: there will be too many bodies to squeeze into campus spaces to support multiple events for Class of '22::: '21 and '20). Sadly::: this feels like the Class of 2020 will be the ""Forgotten Class.""

I'm hoping they make it happen by 2023 ... the longer it rides::: the less likely it seems it will happen.,The Great Ghost Class of 2020. 🐅,The class of 2020 deserves more than “honoring their achievements”. The university should give them their own courtyard for reunions in May of 2022 and should hold a graduation ceremony for them then. The university should pay for the bands and entertainment in lieu of the funds that would have been spent on “class day” prom and the other events of a typical graduation week. These students are still hurting. Please don’t just “honor” them::: but bring them back together for some healing!,This is so sad and disappointing to hear. I do understand the concern for safety during this uncertain time. However::: I hope the University will at least send the great class of 2020 their class jackets as soon as possible. They deserve at least that. They don’t even have their cap and gowns.,I’m so sorry for you and David. It really sucks that all his hard work and dedication to Princeton will not be recognized the way it should be. ❤️❤️❤️,You’ve looked after my ‘20 so well. I’m sad but completely understand your position and look forward to coming back when it’s safe to do so.

#TellUsTigers: “I first learned ‘The Swan’ by Camille Saint-Saëns when I was 11 years old. I remember watching a video of a Yo-Yo Ma performance and crying during the last iteration of the theme — it was that beautiful. I imagine the swan both passionate and poised as it glides along::: aware of its surroundings but unbothered by them. I have been trying to embody that mentality as I move through a world in which so much is beyond my control. When classes became virtual last spring::: I hoped to take advantage of my newly flexible schedule by practicing more. Instead::: I found myself struggling to prioritize cello. With no upcoming performances::: I didn’t have any goals. It felt ‘unproductive’ to play cello when I could be working on assignments::: sleeping or exercising. Part of me also dreaded the way I would sound when I picked up my cello again after a long time away. At the same time::: I did not feel like myself without playing cello. I realized that playing cello now is self-care — something I do on a regular basis just because it makes me feel better. My role as a student coach with @TrentonArtsatPrinceton has helped me stay on track with this ‘self-care journey.’ Every Saturday::: I have a Zoom with my Trenton Youth Orchestra student::: Brandon::: whom I started teaching a year ago. Brandon responds quickly to feedback and improves a lot during his lessons. Since the pandemic started::: however::: it has been challenging for him to find a time to practice that does not interrupt his family members’ work-related calls. One piece of advice I give him is that practicing for five minutes is better than not practicing at all. I tell him what he should focus on if he only has five minutes — sometimes it is just a single measure of music. I would give myself and everyone the same advice: an all-or-nothing mindset is never healthy and is especially unhealthy right now. If I can’t fit in cello practice::: I listen to music. One of my go-to pieces is Mozart’s Requiem. My family thinks I am dramatic for this::: but I think the enormity & timeless subject matter of the piece help me keep things in perspective.” — Katie Cappola ’23; video by David Kelly Crow #Princetagram,2020-12-14 13:06:59,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Professor Betsy Paluck and other experts who study the way we think and make decisions say that it can be more than politics driving our decision-making this year. The unprecedented nature of the pandemic undermines how we process information and assess risk.  PROPUBLICA.ORG How Your Brain Tricks You Into Taking Risks During the Pandemic,2020-12-05 20:07:09,Diego Rielo😯,Enjoyed reading this article on decision making during the pandemic. Found a significant contradiction in the article though. Eve Witttenberg::: a decision scientist at Harvard::: states 'people are not stupid here'. Really? Stupid is defined as having or showing a great lack of intelligence or common sense. I'll give people the benefit of the doubt and rule out the 'having' part of the definition because I don't want to accuse people unfairly of not having intelligence so I'll focus on the 'showing' part of the definition. If stupid can be defined by a great lack of showing intelligence::: how to you account for the behavior at the Sturgis motorcycle rally or at the Barrett nomination celebration? During the peak of a pandemic to not wear face coverings and to gather in close quarters either amongst the hundreds of thousands of bikers in South Dakota or the hundreds of political insiders at the Rose Garden depicts stupidity at its finest::: in my opinion.,"""The journey of Princeton University::: is a shared resource::: sum in sun shine."" The amount of people from its start who contributed to the Princeton University. The amount of people who lived there daily lives in the world because of Princeton University. The stories::: memories::: vision. Its overwhelming::: Princeton University is not just land and bricks or education and administration its biology. Its tough to run a university::: Princeton University has delivered the code::: generated the seed and sculpted its history.

#TellUsTigersPartII x #WellnessWednesday: “During my senior year at Princeton::: I began having random nose bleeds and my medical provider informed me that I had high blood pressure and was on the brink of needing medication to regulate it. I was 22 years old and devastated by this news. It was the call to action I needed to prioritize my health and well-being. I was an active member of several campus organizations::: president of the Class of 2018 and a residential college adviser — on top of a rigorous academic course load and maintaining social connections. To cope with stress::: I turned to food. I knew that emotional eating negatively impacted my physical and mental health::: yet I felt helpless. I started many fad diets and exercise programs::: which led to further disappointment as I was not focused on creating long-term::: sustainable health goals. The first time I was featured in #TellUsTigers — on Dec. 21::: 2017 — I reflected on academic experiences where other students made assumptions about my identity solely based on my race::: and the importance of fostering inclusive educational environments. I didn’t touch on it then::: but I was also dealing with some personal health challenges. After graduation::: I started a fulltime job and introduced group fitness and mindful eating into my regular wellness practice. In the beginning::: I worked with a fitness coach to establish my goals and track my progress. I have accountability partners for support too. This year has presented unique challenges. The severity of the pandemic and working in a virtual environment introduced potential stressors for us all. As a Black man::: I have been affected by the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on my community and acts of racial injustice happening globally. In a time of turbulence::: I have been able to find strength and stability through wellness and leaning on my supportive community. As there is not a one-size fits all approach to wellness::: everyone must endeavor on their own personal journey to discover what improves their well-being and makes them feel good.” — Brandon McGhee ’18; photo by Zhao Chen #Princetagram,2020-12-02 20:29:10,Good evening sir::: I'm searching a scholarship to keep on my studies::: because I've no money to pay my studies.

This event features a panel discussion with Center for Information Technology Policy director professor Matthew Salganik and Princeton University Computer Science faculty members Mona Singh and Elad Hazan *06. Moderated by Microsoft president Brad Smith '81. #ForwardFest,2020-11-21 01:00:14,Welcome to #ForwardFest! We hope you’ll enjoy tonight’s programming. We’ve created a Resource Guide for you to help engage in this conversation and to learn more about our Forward Thinkers: https://bit.ly/ 3pG54KW,Are you an optimist or a pessimist about the future of data science and artificial intelligence? Why?,How might your current job change in the next 10 years due to advances in AI and robots - and what type of education will be required to help the world’s workforce adapt?,How do we ensure that A) the machines and programs remain accountable to people and B) that those who designed them also remain accountable? What needs to be done for people to trust AI?,Thank you for tuning in to #ForwardFest! Next month’s installation takes place on Dec. 17. Keep an eye out for more information at forwardthinking .princeton.edu/ festival,Would you say this is social. Or personal?,There need to be ethical and legal parameters and regulations restricting data. Information can invade privacy and can be used to restrict people's freedom. Insurance companies can restrict policies to those they feel are likely to become ill::: or to avoid people who may make claims. Banks used data to red line neighborhoods and decline loans to people of color. And it is frightening to know Google and Microsoft is compiling a data dosier on me to be sold to the highest bidder. So I get ads that target me::: based on key words::: which is very threatening.,They value it,I work as an attorney::: and a good deal of my job involves human interaction and evaluation. AI can be used as a tool::: just as a hammer can be used as a tool. But data and analysis of data still needs human supervision. I can see how data and artificial intelligence can be useful::: but I don't believe AI can replace human intelligence (which is also flawed.),My mother too😗😗,I love PU😗😗,And living ai and humans require surgery when their parts break down,Both human and machines die.,I enjoyed Forward Fest. I would like to continue to attend zoom meetings with Princeton!,They should get DNA tests for themselves at Ancestry::: 23andMe::: My Heritage::: Family TreeDNA::: their exomes::: and full genomes and explore third party tools as well.,Data science and AI::: like any technology::: can be used for good or evil. China is compiling data on all its citizens to control their lives. AI can be used for predictive purposes::: or for replacing humans with machines::: or to free up humans. I'm generally optimistic::: but cautious.,Johnny Brasil,Vasishta HarekalPranav Gupta great format,Sadly::: we all don't agree. There are some bad actors and all nations don't have the same objectives or ethics. An ever know from international hacking::: etc. that data is fragile. Saudi Arabia::: Iran::: North Korea::: Russia may have very different objectives. Cambridge Analytica used data for political purposes. Genetic data is extremely dangerous. We know of predispositions for certain illnesses. Companies may fail to hire employees who are likely to come down with a disease.,Pictorial memory.

The use of the terms ""racism"" and ""white supremacy"" in this context aren't meant to suggest that 60-70 million people in the country are racists insofar as they have individual animus toward black people.

"#TellUsTigers: ""The most important lesson I’ve learned at Princeton University is to be myself. I used to be so focused on what the ‘ideal’ Princeton student was::: I almost didn’t apply. In high school::: my parents divorced. Within two weeks::: my mother::: brother and I completely restarted our lives. When college application season came around::: I was so drained from the accumulated trauma that I did not want to risk rejection from my dream school. So::: I had initially given up on the Ivy League. One night::: my cousin Christian came over for dinner and spoke about the importance of taking the opportunity::: convincing me to apply to Princeton. A few months later things fell into place::: and I became a member of Princeton’s Class of 2021. Once at #PrincetonU::: I found myself so focused on ‘fitting in.’ At the time::: I struggled to articulate exactly who I wanted to be — but I knew I wanted to fit in somewhere. In waiting for others to see me::: I felt invisible. It can be difficult to exist at Princeton as your authentic self for many reasons. I perceived elite perfection to be most valued. For me::: internalized white supremacy and imposter syndrome had me believing that I did not deserve to walk the halls my ancestors helped build. As I started to gain more confidence::: I created spaces such as Black Pre-Med Society and Black Organization for Leadership Development (BOLD)::: a mentorship program for underserved high school students::: in the hopes that other people can be empowered to be authentically themselves. I stopped asking for a seat at the table and built my own::: welcoming others in. I decided to pursue medical anthropology as my major because it interrogates health in a sick society that allows for a select few to eat at the table::: while the majority starve. Through intentional study and practice in public health::: we can create the reality for a more just future. As a rising senior::: I learned to define myself for myself. I am so grateful for my mother::: family::: friends::: mentors::: and boyfriend who continue to encourage and empower me to keep walking in my own truth::: charting my own path."" — Angelika Nattiel Morris ’21; photo by Zhamoyani McMillan '21 #Princetagram",2020-08-23 14:04:00,Way to go::: Angelika!

#TellUsTigers: “When #COVID19 hit and colleges across the country had to send students home::: I had to worry about securing housing for the first time in my life. Princeton is 9:::314 miles away from Malaysia and I had less than a week to decide if returning to my family was even possible. I will never forget that week that I spent discussing with other international students about what in the world we were all going to do. Travel bans were being put in place::: flight prices were soaring and we were all worried about our visa status. To have my notion of home taken away from me prematurely was scary and destabilizing. As an international student::: Princeton had been my one and only home in the United States. I had no family here::: and I had no home to return to in this country. As I considered what to do::: I remembered the first night of freshman orientation when I saw the beautiful stained glass windows of Richardson Auditorium — that was when it dawned on me that Princeton would be my new home. Home has always had a unique meaning to me because I have lived away from ‘home’ for half my life. I went to two boarding schools in Malaysia on scholarship between the ages of 13 to 20 before I came to Princeton. As I fell in love with the campus and my college experience as a #firstgen::: low-income student::: Princeton began to feel like home more and more. After the University sent students home in March::: I called many different places my temporary home. For the remainder of the semester::: I was able to stay in my room in Spelman after all my roommates had left. The house on Bank Street where I moved off campus to with a few friends. My friend’s home in California where she and her family graciously let me stay. The tent that we camped in at seven national parks to make up for our lost post-graduation trip. Despite all of the changes happening in the world now::: there is one thing that has remained constant: the friends I have made at Princeton University over the last four years. In times like these::: I am reminded that it is the people::: not the places::: in my life that I can call home.” — Ben Yap '20; photo by David Kelly Crow #Princetagram #Princeton2020 #FLI,2020-08-16 14:08:00,Go Tigers!,Ben I am so glad you are doing well.

'Liberalism' was actually invented by a Philosopher named ""John Stuart Mill"". His thought is closely aligned with ""Utilitarianism "" and ""Pragmatism"" in some regards::: but the Modern extensions of his Thoughts have rendered ""Liberalism"" a totally untenable and false Philosophy.  John Stuart Mill::: like his follower William James Siddis (named after the Philosopher William James::: a founder of Pragmatism) was a Socialist. Despite having IQs of around 300 (by modern measurement systems)::: both of these very brilliant men embraced a firm belief in what we now call ""Socialism"".  Both JS Mill and WJ Siddis learned Ancient Greek without being taught::: by the age of 3 (or 8:::depending upon whom you believe). Siddis lectured to Harvard students on ""Black holes"" at the age of 12::: long before they were a topic of any interest. There is no doubt that both of these people were terribly gifted. They were also victimized by an ignorant Society that could not conceive their Brilliance. Nonetheless::: they were both extremely wrong in their convictions.  Personally::: I visited my first Black hole when I was about 6::: so I had a slight edge on both of them. Also::: as a ""Pragmatist"" myself::: I wasn't too interested in learning Ancient Greek... Instead::: I spent my time learning how to pilot reconstructed::: reverse-enginee red UFOs designed by Aliens. I wasn't terribly good at it::: but I was good at the Theory -\-\ particularly about the ""Information Loss"" problem.  I can't claim to have invented a language at the age of 3::: like William Siddis (his language was called 'Vendergood')::: but I did invent a way to transmit encrypted messages of superluminal information several hundred years before I was born. The Brandenburg concerti (composed by my cousin JS Bach) are one example.  My technology::: or 'technique' if you will::: was so effective that I sent over 100 emails to the FBI::: CIA::: DIA::: etc. prior to the 9/11 attacks warning about a severe National Security disaster. The Communists at the FBI were particularly belligerent about this::: and were annoying in their refusal to obey Law. I had to report the L.A. Branch of the FBI to the Washington Branch::: which proceeded to investigate the L.A. Branch and charge one of them with Treason. This is a fact::: not speculation. The mainstream Media covers this up. The FBI has actively been an agent for the promulgation of Communist ideology for many years::: and multiple FBI agents have bragged to me about their involvement with Communist Russia::: and China.  No wonder that President Trump has been so beleaguered by the KGB-like FBI. I can understand his suspicions about the CIA::: as well::: but they are a different agency.  My point::: of course::: is that ""Socialism"" has always failed::: in every single effort at its implementation. There are absolutely no examples of 'successful Socialism' that exist on our Planet (or any other::: as far as I know of). If there had been::: they would have been killed off with our most advanced Technology::: long ago::: for safety.  Now happens to be the age and moment where We (The People) need to repel the insidious onslaught of creeping::: creepy Socialism and Socialists like AOC::: Joe Biden::: Camel the Harass::: etc. We need to stand up for Individualism and for Freedom::: Human Rights::: and Fairness for All.  The least 'fair' people on this planet are the 'so-claimed' Liberals::: with their Totalitarian::: Authoritarian::: Anti-family::: Anti-human rights agenda. The age of ""Liberalism"" is dead.

#TellUsTigers: “I am a Class of 2020 Princeton University graduate but first and foremost I graduated as a FLI (first-generation/low-income) student. I am #FLI::: but I'm not the first in my family to attend a university because my older sister Melissa attended UC San Diego. Academically::: I followed in her footsteps in a lot of ways. At Orange Glen High School in Escondido::: California::: she led me right into the care of one of our teachers::: Ms. Rachel Bronwyn::: a 1991 Princeton alumna with a master's in art history from Williams College. Her mission? Share her love of art history and literature with under-resourced students in City of Escondido. She is known for being an eclectic teacher who works intensely to support others. ‘I think you should start looking at schools like this’ were the first words Ms. Bronwyn said to me::: blinking twice emphatically (the Bronwyn Blink) after barging into one of my high school classes freshman year and shoving a pamphlet for Williams College into my hands. Ms. Bronwyn became a second mother to me. She was the one who told me about QuestBridge::: which matches high-achieving students from low-income backgrounds with leading colleges and universities. She taught me how to aim high. She barged into another of my classes on December 1::: 2015::: almost exactly four years after the first time. This time she was sobbing with joy after I had opened my Princeton acceptance email. I had been matched through Questbridge — the happiest day of my life. She shoved an oversized orange tee shirt into my hands before excusing herself to make a sign that would cover a wall of the high school administration building for weeks saying ‘Princeton said yes to our Tabitha!’ Ms. Bronwyn had not returned to #PrincetonU for more than 20 years and the odds of her making the trip decreased after being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis during my senior year of high school.

#TellUsTigers: “Growing up in Sri Lanka::: I initially never considered pursuing higher education in the United States. Most colleges do not offer low-income international students financial aid. Of the few that do::: only a handful of highly selective universities are need-blind. I had another inherent disadvantage: Could the English I learned by reading children’s adventure stories by candlelight — power cuts are common where I grew up — match up to that of a native speaker? I found Princeton through a Google search for colleges that would offer me aid. After being accepted::: I assumed the struggle was over. I spent my first days on campus marveling — no more mosquito nets or jittery Wi-Fi! My illusions were rudely shattered hours before day one of classes. I trudged back to the bookstore to return all the textbooks I had purchased the previous night::: guilty at having spent the equivalent of a month’s salary in Sri Lanka. After that::: I would usually pick classes that my friends also chose so I could share their textbooks. Enduring winter break in solitude on campus was cheaper than buying a ticket home. Two jobs at a library and as a teaching assistant took up 8 precious hours each week. Through it all::: I was fortunate to befriend and room with several other international students in similar situations. We shared our reasons for coming to the US::: bemoaned the fact that our financial aid was taxed and made fun of the imperial system of measurement. Although arduous at times::: my experience at Princeton contributed to my intellectual and personal development in a manner that would never have been possible had I not chosen to leave my home country for college. I had studied a strictly linear curriculum in Sri Lanka::: so the academic diversity of the liberal arts system was a refreshing change. From working with bees in England to cataloging ancient coins at Firestone Library::: my summers were never boring. Wrapping up senior year in Spelman Hall::: overlooking the courtyard with the Picasso statue::: where it all began at International Orientation::: I am certain that my Princeton University journey was worthwhile.” — Sandun Bambarandage ’20; photo by David Kelly Crow #Princetagram,2020-07-19 14:11:07,All the best to you!,What a remarkable story,Sandun Bambarandage much wow,Wonderful story.

#TellUsTigers: “I was born in the Philippines and moved to the US with my family in 2006. My junior year of high school::: I was admitted to LEDA Leadership Enterprise for a Diverse America::: a summer program hosted at Princeton to help high-achieving students from under-resourced backgrounds gain admission to college. During my time at LEDA::: I fell in love with Princeton’s campus::: decided to apply and was admitted. My acceptance was so surprising and exciting — I would be the first to attend college in my family. My 4 years at Princeton opened so many opportunities. I traveled the world::: to Thailand as a Streicker Fellow::: to the Philippines for Princeton School of Public and International Affairs senior thesis research and to India with my South Asian studies class ‘Gender::: Sexuality and Feminism in South Asia.’ I met lifelong friends throughout the years and am thankful for the Freshman Scholars Institute and Scholars Institute Fellows Program for providing me a community of friends and mentors my first year at Princeton. Looking back as a #FLI student::: navigating Princeton can be challenging and lonely::: but the support from faculty and alumni mentors and especially my friends helped get me through the most difficult times. Graduating virtually was bittersweet and even more so for my family since this college graduation would have been the first for us::: and my brother Dan will be entering as a member of Class of 2024. My heart goes out to my fellow classmates who identify as FLI like me. Commencement represents a celebration of sacrifice and overcoming of challenges — I celebrate with you on graduating #PrincetonU. With my senior year ending so abruptly::: I urge the Class of 2024 to treasure your moments in the next four years::: explore your interests::: try new things and ask for help when you need it. I am very grateful for the Class of 2020 for providing me with so many memories to treasure. While we graduated together virtually::: I’m looking forward to next year when we gather to celebrate on campus.

Princeton stands firmly with our international students.  On July 6::: United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) announced a precipitous::: unexpected change in policy affecting international students at Princeton and throughout the country.

Is such an illogical position tenable::: or was this a move to protect the financial interests of Princeton by eliminating sources of controversy? The logic given is that the bad always outweighs the good. Am I misinterpreting that? So the Washington Monument should go? The Lincoln Memorial (Lincoln was still quite the racist)::: the Jefferson Memorial? Princeton itself is built on a legacy of genocide::: should the school be torn down and returned to indigenous peoples? Systemic racism is incredibly challenging to confront::: I just don’t see how this connects. Watch the school be renamed after some industrialist who donates money. On the flip side::: I would love to see society learn from its mistakes and tear down absolutely everything we’ve built while destroying our planet::: so maybe I’m the hypocrite.,How do I get into Princeton University now?,Hopefully the expensive merchants in Princeton township get the message they top the racism charts,One word: ridiculous,From today’s Prince::: the student demand letter:  https:// www.dailyprincet onian.com/ article/2020/06/ against-anti-bla ck-racism-in-th e-woodrow-wilso n-school,So hypocritical.

A person from the early 1900's and long dead. But the real question is is what action are you going to take against Biden who wanted to keep segregation in the 1970's?,And in the future::: when reason will prevail over PC and threats of violence::: perhaps we will look back and erase this ridiculous decision. I only hope in the future we won't erase the names of those who did these ridiculous decisions.,How many people gnashing their teeth about this didn’t know Princeton had a school named for Wilson until it was changed?,The past cannot be fixed by tearing down the statues... They are part of the history::: whether they teach bad or good things::: but they are facts that happened already. No need to remove any statue of this great man. Just change your mind and behavior towards minority groups. You will see that racism has little or nothing to do with statues.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thank you::: Princeton!,Doc Brooklyn,When were women first admitted to Princeton? Why does racism trump sexism?,As an African American alum of both the school the university and even the residential college for all four years I was deeply disappointed to learn Wilson’s racist history AFTER I graduated. That is something I wish the university had shared.  As the the only African American male in my class at the now Princeton School of Public and International affairs::: the programs and school felt cold as if it was just a place I was visiting and not the home of my major. This was despite some welcoming faculty who aided me in my future career in policy and government.  Upon learning the history later it was obvious to me that Wilson having his way would’ve meant I never attended the university::: that my parents never worked for the Federal Government and that I never would’ve worked in the house in which he once lived::: as a policy advisor.  I’m glad he didn’t get his way ::: well forever::: but I lament all of those black men and women who came before me who because of him never had the chance to attend the university or work for Uncle Sam::: and who’s families suffered economic inequalities as a result.  The name should’ve been changed in 2016 as I shared with Trustees then::: but I’m proud of my alma mater for making this change now. Even prouder finally to be an alum of the school and university.

The critique has been around for a long time. Glad you’re on board but there’s still work to do.,Good job.

Real pieces of work here...,Wilson::: raised in Virginia in the period after the Civil War::: should have been able to look 100 years and realize that he would not meet the standards of the Princeton University community. He should have abandoned everything he had been taught so that he could live up to your 2020 standards.. After all::: his entire life should be measured only by his attitude towards race. To the minnows at Princeton that seems to be the only standard. Now that you have banned his name perhaps you should check out the campus libraries and find his writings and have a bpnfire in the quad. You could rename it Bebelplaz in your own honor.

"Princeton University's Board of Trustees has voted to remove Woodrow Wilson’s name from the School of Public Policy and International Affairs and residential college. The trustees have concluded that Wilson’s racist thinking and policies make him an inappropriate namesake for a school or college whose scholars and alumni must stand firmly against racism in all its forms. The public policy school will now be known as Princeton School of Public and International Affairs and the residential college will be known as ""First College."" These are not the only steps our University is taking to combat the realities and legacy of racism::: but they are important ones.

YOU CAN'T CHANGE HISTORY.,I was against at first. But the more I read and the more I thought about this::: the more convinced I became that this is the right move.

Hmmm????i dont know ::: i find something very offensive about all of them.,Disappointing.. . definitely withdrawing financial support for the school..,Clearly the right decision. Certainly::: a stinging rebuke to Wilson's racism.  While Princeton has taken steps to reexamine Wilson's history::: this was wholly unexpected.

Craig Willis::: '78 (Urban Affairs::: School of Public and International Affairs) Cleveland::: Ohio,Princeton was founded by slave owners::: it's first 9 presidents were slave owners & most of it's professors were slave owners.

Teach history::: learn from it. Don’t destroy it or hide from it because it makes you uncomfortable.,Lets continue erasing history and make believe it never happened. That will fix everything. Getting ridiculous now.,Well done🧡🖤,"Great to hear this. Not a move to take lightly but all the more significant and necessary. Symbolism is important: I appreciate the part of the board's statement that explains::: ""Identifying a political leader as the namesake for a public policy school inevitably suggests that the honoree is a role model for those who study in the school."" And the crucial section of President Eisgruber's letter points out to us: ""Princeton honored Wilson not because of::: but without regard to or perhaps even in ignorance of::: his racism. That::: however::: is ultimately the problem. Princeton is part of an America that has too often disregarded::: ignored::: or excused racism::: allowing the persistence of systems that discriminate against Black people."" Worth it for all of us Americans to consider. Frederick Martin '94",It is so important to be careful when erasing history. “You don’t know where you’re going unless you know where you have been:::”to paraphrase President Bill Clinton. We should not wipe out our past but use it as a springboard to move forward.,Thank you Princeton::: for doing the right thing. I only wish you'd done it sooner::: when your own students asked you too. But better late than never.,i will stop all my trust to your school ASAP,I randomly had Fox News on and heard their spin of “a small liberal arts college erasing a president.” I applaud Princeton’s decision and all the discussion and thought that went into it. Looking forward to erasing another racist president in Nov!,Wow- we might actually be making a little progress; applaud the board for this! Long overdue and it is my sincere hope and prayer that academia at large understand how important they are to the future of the nation and at the same time take a hard look inside. You’ve lost a lot of trust and credibility with the people of the nation. Sunlight is the best disinfectant-le t’s move forward together fearlessly and as one nation🇺🇸 Educate our kids with truth & integrity as your watchwords-leav e the indoctrination behind.,Thank you! Ana Cubas *96,Your bowing down to a group of people that hate America. WTF is wrong with you all. You have disgraced NJ.,It’s a shame you bowed to political correctness. You as a university should use this as teaching moment::: but decided not to. Erasing history is setting a precedent for the future which is a dangerous.,"... can't belive my eyes. My country::: and very possibly also my nation::: would not exist if not for Wilson - who pushed the concept of self-determinat ion. This lead to decolonializati on - first in Europe::: but eventually also elsewhere.

Be careful what kind of leaders you're producin' here.'",Cowardly::: socialist idea. Time to contact representatives to stop any and all funding to this Un-American school.,I hope every person who believes in history refuses to enter into an academic career at Princeton you are destroying the U.S. by forgetting your history.,1) To paraphrase a statement I heard: If someone who died over 90 years ago is ruining your life::: you need to get a life. 2) With the current crazy thinking::: they'll need to take George Washington's and Thomas Jefferson's name off every building. They were both slave owners. Jefferson fathered a child with one of his slaves who he did not acknowledge. You might as well bulldoze the Washington & Jefferson memorials in Washington. Oops::: Our capital can't be called Washington anymore...,The right decision,Bravo! So proud of our Princeton ❤️.,Hey Princeton- how about you close your doors instead?! Founded in 1794::: the school allowed students to bring their slaves to school u til 1746 (50 years). Plus the first five presidents and a few professors had slaves. Oh::: and at one point 63% of your students came from slave states. Quit picking on the statues and take a look at your own sins.

I used to walk past Woodrow Wilson school everyday to class. The building and the fountain will always be remembered as “Wooly woo” as how we used to call it. Erasing history is never going to correct historical mistakes in humanity.,Not being a fan of the 16th amendment::: I'm no fan of Woodrow Wilson. I'm even less of a fan of those who lack a consistent north star::: and Trustee's who weathervane with the political winds are clearly directionless. Had the board been proactive prior to BLM::: then I could accept their decision to rename the public policy school as forward-thinkin g.

Once i found out about Wilson::: he seemed a poor role model any more.,"This is an appropriate change by the University::: and I say that as a former resident of Wilson College.

Thank you President Eisgruber and Board of Trustees for doing the right thing. Richard Thomason *90,Really? You are falling in line with the lunacy and the bigotry and the blackmail. A Democrat President and a President of your own University. You have lost your minds. Everyone has a past but it doesn’t change history.

Princeton did not admit its first black student until 1947. That man Joseph Moss graduated in 1951. Yale had admitted its first black student 100 years earlier in the person of Beverly Williams . Edward Buchet was the first black student admitted to Harvard in 1870. So if you apply the same criteria to the school as they have to Woodrow Wilson then the school itself must be closed . When one generation indicts another on the basis of current social norms then it creates a huge house of glass . Princeton wants credit that it evolved from an all white school to what it is today .

I would so much rather there be a thoughtful review of historical ideologies than a suppression and censorship of them. I am not a believer in book burning or the physical erasure of a lived past to conform to present and prevailing sentiment. I think the act has frightening echoes throughout modern history. There are so many more powerful ways to create and build something new which can truly support enduring equality and foster intellectual freedom on campus - than any act of suppression or historical erasure can hope to achieve. Pulling down a statue or renaming the one of the most notable graduate schools for public policy in this country does not honor the history of African American alumni::: of which my father was one::: or of those who achieved “firsts” at the Woodrow Wilson School and in public policy. The censorship of history::: now considered more objectionable than ever::: has never advanced freedom in society. Censorship and historical erasure don’t seem to me to be true tenants of a place for advanced learning. I understand the desire to transform::: and to build a more enlightened foundation for the future::: I just wish censorship and historical erasure did not have to be the method of choice.,This is so stupid::: political correctness run amok. Actions like this diminish the importance of stopping the practice of honoring Confederate officers or slave traders. What’s next::: Ford says it has to stop calling its car the Mustang because it has its roots in the Native American tradition::: and we as a nation abused native Americans? Come on guys::: draw sensible lines somewhere. Do we next condemn Washington and Jefferson because they owned slaves::: or honor all the amazingly good things they did in context? Grow up.,Denying our history will not move us forward. Embracing our hsitory will. President Wilson acted in his time and prejudice existed in his time. How can you even consider removing his name or any of the other denials of where we were - that is how we got to where we are now. Yes prejudice still exists but trying to erase history will not do any good. Are you going to erase all hatred of Jews and women and Catholics and Indians or anyone else who is different.,A good first step. Please make the hiring & curricular changes demanded by Change WWS Now. (P’15),"To commenters who disagree::: consider: 1) this does not ""erase history:::"" as President Eisgruber stated: ""Part of our responsibility as a University is to preserve Wilson’s record in all of its considerable complexity"" & 2) equality at Princeton U.means that no one who wants to major in Pubic & International Affairs should have to do so in a school named after a man who re-segregated the federal civil service & praised the KKK in a quote that was featured in the racist film Birth of a Nation. https:// twitter.com/ BeschlossDC/ status/ 1276931208778260 481",why not just remove everything so that we have no reminders of history?,Another Stupid decision. We have to LEARN from History::: good and bad. Life is imperfect .Wilson::: was President of Princeton and the United States. He had many great accomplishments and no one is Completely PURE::: in thought::: word and deed.,Just heard I want to say a few things: 1) it is shame you fight with history::: history there to not let forget::: history important::: he maybe was a racist::: but that was sad times when most of the leaders were. So why we fight them now? you cant fight dead person applying other time ethical judgment::: it is stupid! Anyway::: he is part of the country's history::: done many good things for the country. 2) What is more silly that you doing it due to fear::: due to a minor fraction of the vocal public. History should be unchangeable::: untouchable::: tomorrow masses will decide differently and you as vane will change direction? Where is your dignity? where are your core values as a pillar of education? Racism is no more a part of USA::: maybe minor spots occur over time but it will be gone over time.... if you are thinking such actions good for black people you are wrong. It is a shame that destroying statues::: asking people to stand on knees are supported. You are not bringing people together trying to raise overall population levels just acting situationally. Shame on you...,The only ONLY way to end racism is to start in the home where hatred is taught and stop that teaching. Teach young children to love and embrace differences and not to hate. But trying to erase history is to deny how far we have come. It will not help. What about all the good that President Wilson did - are you going to erase that too::: because he acted in his time? You are the ones who are racist!!!!!,For an institution that claims to be at the apex of being brilliant :::you sure incredibly stupid and so are your moronic ::: selfish ::: anti American students . Shame on you and this embarrassment to New Jersey !,You waited until the year 2020 to do it? Clearly it never bothered you before the protests. Princeton University is acting like this is the first time they are learning of Woodrow Wilson’s history. They always knew for many years but they didn’t care. Virtual signaling. 🤔,"I'm assuming now that Princeton is finally addressing racism::: they will now stop supporting the white supremacist Planned Parenthood link on their website at https:// uhs.princeton.ed u/ health-resources /sexual-health considering it's founder Margaret Sanger said quote::: ""We should hire three or four colored ministers::: preferably with social-service backgrounds::: and with engaging personalities. The most successful educational approach to the Negro is through a religious appeal. We don't want the word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population. And the minister is the man who can straighten out that idea if it ever occurs to any of their more rebellious members."" Princeton is actively referring it's students on it's own website to a white supremacist racist founded organization. Where's the outrage??? Mr. Christopher Eisgruber::: we're looking for you and the board of trustees to continue to show leadership and stop promoting a white supremacist founded organization on the website of Princeton.

Since we are going to smear::: denigrate and tear down the statues of men like Woodrow Wilson::: George Washington and Thomas Jefferson::: and since we are going to be forced to rename our military bases::: I propose we expand the focus to include the broad racist history of the Democrat Party. Yes the party of slavery and segregation::: of Jim Crow and the KKK. If we are going to judge historical figures::: Let’s go ahead and judge these historical figures too::: and then “cancel” them from our history • How about the distinguished Democrat Senator J. William Fulbright::: a man eulogized by Bill Clinton as his mentor and one of the 99 Democrat congressmen who signed the “Southern Manifesto” against desegregation. (Shouldn’t we get rid of the Fulbright Scholarship named for him?) • How about racist Democrat Senator Al Gore Sr. who joined Fulbright in voting against the 1964 Civil Rights Act. • How about the “Honorable” Democrat Senator Robert C. Byrd::: who once held the position of “Exalted Cyclops” in the KKK and who worked side-by-side with Nancy Pelosi for over 20 years. (There are rooms in the Capital Building named after him – Shouldn’t those rooms be renamed?) • How about Democrat President Lyndon Baines Johnson who was fond of using the “N” word behind closed doors and was a leader in the “Southern Resistance movement which opposed integration in the 1950’s. • How about Democrat President Franklin Delano Roosevelt who interned thousands of American citizens of Japanese descent in cages during World War II. • How about Democrat President Jimmy Carter who supported anti-civil rights legislation in the Georgia State Senate and who remained a member of the Plains Baptist Church which would not admit Black members.  I’m sure there are many more. By the new standard::: we should be pulling down any statues::: removing any portrait paintings and changing any streets::: buildings and memorials named after these men. See where this is going? Be careful what you ask for.,Intolerance AND Hypocrisy at its best‼️ The #PrincetonBoardo fTrustees view point AND THEY get to make this name change decision?

On Friday::: June 19::: Princeton will be closed to commemorate Juneteenth and offer all faculty and staff a fully paid day off to recognize the significance of this day for our community::: and to provide space to contemplate how we can do our part to eliminate structural and overt racism and other forms of discrimination on our campus::: in our communities and in our country.  This moment of reflection is just one step on a longer journey.  PRINCETON.EDU Juneteenth — A Day of Reflection,2020-06-18 14:08:13,I’ll applaud when the Woodrow Wilson monuments::: excuse me::: the white supremacy monuments that Princeton has decided are more worthwhile than the opinions::: wellbeing::: and experiences of the actual::: living::: breathing black people that manage to love this institution despite so much neglect and disdain are gone,This is pandering. Princeton has the wonderful benefit of a vibrant and vocal black student community that has made it very clear how much suffering goes into existing as black student in most Princeton spaces,Nice step Princeton University!,Or... what if we made Princeton a place where the actual black students that attend could be happy,Starbucks too has announced it being a paid holiday,Thirapong Santiphop,Great idea. We should make voting day a national holiday also,🤔,So proud to be a part of the Princeton family ❤️❤️,how virtuous.❤️,Real proud of you Princeton,They should use the day to do something for the community,Danielle Victoriano lmao meanwhile penn just said “reflect” 🤣🤣,Keep it up. If more institutions did this::: it would gain traction at the national level. Its a very important day for Americans and probably one not many even knew about.,so proud to work here.,💚,🖤🧡,It’s wild how I feel even more disrespected after this post than before (for context I already felt quite disrespected),My growing contempt,Shallow actions,Hollow words,The contemplation wouldn’t be necessary if the institution listened and responded to the concerns which the black community has quite literally screamed at the administration,😂😂😂😢😭😭,A wonderful PR stunt,The only change that I will accept is that which values the black lives with which our university has been entrusted,Blatant hypocrisy,Hypocrisy,Let just hope action comes before I become ashamed to have attended or to have even wanted to attend this university,Princeton is my happy place but it grows and less and less so each day as the discrepancy between the value it places upon me as a potential donor vs as a black student becomes more and more apparent to me,THE AUDACITY!!!!,The audacity,If I had felt that this school valued our presence::: I would’ve welcomed this change and touted it as a resolute victory::: but::: unfortunately::: I cannot,Instead of spending time reflecting on how the university can better serve its black community it can listen to the black voices that have been shouting at it for years,Juneteenth is not new. BLM is not new. Black activism on Princeton’s campus is not new. This response is and that breaks my heart. Black lives aren’t Princeton’s props. Black lives are lives.,Black students have been demonstrating on Princeton’s campus consistently for years. We have asked to be heard::: and I see now that the school I love only loved me when someone is watching,It’s nice that this institution values external pressure and perceptions as much as it does only because it doesn’t value the black people that actually form a part of the community. At least something matters to Princeton but this just reminds that black lives don’t,Y’all should contemplate how the name of the Woodrow Wilson School and Wilson College are dehumanizing reminders to every black Princeton student that Princeton cares more about protecting the legacy of a repugnant white supremacist than making black students feel valued on campus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

According to Michael Osterholm::: ‚Äúa One Health approach is critical if we are to prevent and control the major-impact infectious diseases of the 21st century.‚Äù The link between human health and the natural world is more important than ever.  Learn more about One Health: https://z.umn.edu/74nl  TWIN-CITIES.UMN.EDU One Health: A world-changing approach,2021-09-16 15:00:36,I thought Osterholm was supposed to be a scientist. This One Health idea would not prevent new diseases from developing and jumping to humans. Protect the natural habitat::: and the wildlife populations will tend to fill the space. The wildlife species will still interface with humans.  Maybe y‚Äôall should help chart a course through the COVID-19 pandemic::: finding the ‚Äúaverage‚Äù frequency of individual re-infection and the corresponding expected # of annual infections we‚Äôre likely to see going forward. Then we need to know the % that will require hospitalization ::: the ‚Äúaverage‚Äù number of hospital days::: ICU days::: and ventilator days::: so we can figure out how much hospital capacity we probably need to add for the foreseeable future.  But you don‚Äôt want things to return to ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù This pandemic has boosted your sense of self-importance ::: reinforcing your feelings of moral and intellectual superiority.  If you‚Äôre not going to be useful::: then my other suggestion is that you prepare for the funding cuts that are going to come::: as it becomes increasingly clear that COVID-19 was created by people much like you::: with funding from your racketeer friends Peter Daszak and EcoHealth Alliance. You really think your idiotic One Health idea is going anywhere when our schools are experiencing food shortages precisely because people like Joe Biden and Tim Walz took too much of your advice without pushing you for better info and more alternatives?,A bureaucrat believes that it's important to follow his recommendations . Wow.,Hahaha. Mike osterholm. He spins a dial and sees what it points to and then makes a wildly inaccurate prediction that never happens,Cult politics is at work. True test: walk into a Target::: nearly all are masked. Now walk into a Walmart::: nearly no one. Division has always been there and always will be.,"Osterholm has said ""I HAVE HAD CONCERNS AND I -\-\ DATES BACK TO APRIL OF 2020 ABOUT THE CONCEPT OF MASKING.  NEEDLESS TO SAY AS THE POLITICAL HOT BUTTON BEYOND ANYTHING I'VE EVER SEEN IN PUBLIC HEALTH.  AND YET AT THE SAME TIME I THINK WE'VE ALL DONE A DISSERVICE TO THE PUBLIC.""  Just keep cherry picking what he says and dig your hole deeper","The tin foil fedora crowd will flip over this! ""See! I told ya they are controlling the world!""",The guy has been proven wrong so many times,Flabbergasted at the complete uneducated ignorance of comments on this feed.

As much as we all love big brother on our phones and devices::: 24/7::: I‚Äôm unsure we‚Äôd like a twin medical big brother dictating our health.  Unless this sort of strategy includes other areas of health::: count me out.  Think about it: smoking::: drugs::: alcohol::: not wearing helmets while riding::: eating poor foods::: never exercising‚Ä¶. all these things contribute to poor health::: disease::: death::: way more than viruses.  If we police viruses::: we have to police every single negative health choice. Otherwise there‚Äôs no consistency or equity::: right?  Because in reality::: those personal choices truly burden and extract resources from the greater community::: more health issues result in more hospital strain. More reckless behavior requires more short term/long term care.  Can‚Äôt we just get to healing? Address underlying root causes? Immune systems rock::: if we take care of and let them.,PANDEMICS/ EPIDEMICS / CONTAGIOUS DISEASES can't be controlled by health !!

In fact there have been multiple children injured or killed there in the past 2 years. Many more casualties than we have seen from any police brutally in only 2 years. Why isn't the organization focusing on how to get these neighborhoods safe for the people and especially children that live there? They have one of the largest followings now along with the political pull to make things better yet it is only getting worse. So bad in fact it is just a scroll by in the news nowadays or the only way you hear about something shootings are from Facebook crime pages. Where are the BLM leaders on this? I've seen local leaders in that community doing their best but with the money that has been raised by BLM they have no presense there seeing what they can do to stop this.,I‚Äôm glad the U of M is supporting lawlessness openly now as opposed to the way they have silently done it the last several years. üëçüòÇüòÇ,From Lisa Clemons - she‚Äôs in Facebook Jail.

A City that has plunged more money in an election over a ballot question::: that will leave us MORE unsafe::: than we invest in our beautiful children  A City that not even it's highest ranking elected officials understand the TRUE pain in the Black community...

A City where 5 Black women were shot in one night one critical ..... but the strongest young woman ever  A City where a 12 year old can be shot dead in front of his mother over a kid fight that the older brother of the other kids decided to end it with a gun  A City filled with excuses and finger pointing  A City where laws mean NOTHING  A City where it's most vulnerable people are sleeping in tents in the parks::: or on hard dirty grounds because they don't fit the right agenda  A City where one mothers screams of loss has less value than the other because ALL BLACK LIVES don't matter::: just the ones taken by Blue.  A City where a community is so desensitized that kids ride their bikes through the same street someone lost their life on an hour earlier.... Because they don't realized that death is final  A City that can't sleep because they fear bullets will come into their homes and kill their kids  A City that's empty of the most important thing people need ....LOVE.... But has a cup that overflows with HATE  I hugged my 6 and 11 year olds::: before sending them to bed::: and all I could think of is a little boy lying in a freezer at HCMC with 3 bullets in his body.

Looking at a father with the saddest eyes ever::: trying to process how his 12 year old son could be shot to death. A kid::: BY ALL ACCOUNTS::: was a good kid (Not that it matters to me).  A little boys who's friends just saw him on the first day of school and will have to mentally deal with never seeing him again.  Another little girl in a car that some of the bullets went into.... shaking in fear.  A community that will NEVER forget the image of a 12 year old bleeding in the street with his mom trying to perform CPR.... Just picture that Minneapolis.... Picture that BLACK PEOPLE  How do we just go home cooked dinner for our kids::: help them showers and read them a book filled with dream....

Good luck and Gopher it! #UMNproud,2021-09-07 13:30:06,John Quinlan have a great Senior Year!,Honoring major holidays for all people is equity... you didnt do this today::: shame on you.,I am completely disgusted that the U of M would start classes on Rosh Hashanah. It would be equivalent to starting winter semester on Christmas. At least now I‚Äôm officially done donating. I used to be a proud alumni::: went to the U of M for high school::: undergrad and grad school::: my daughter was a Gopher cheerleader::: I serve on the school of public health alumni board::: I‚Äôve told people always I bleed maroon and gold but this is the ultimate slap in the face to the Jewish community. There is no reasonable explanation!,Remembering my first day in 1966. Make it glorious!üéâ,I sure hope someone is monitoring this page because it‚Äôs clear you are sending out a template response. I don‚Äôt think that will work well if you lose all your Jewish alumni donors. I plan at this point to do everything in my power to make that happen because this template response is even more disrespectful. If you think this is an idle threat you may want to take the time to learn more about me because if anyone can do it I can.,Have a great first day Ryan Fauglid,How unfortunate and disrespectful that the U chose to start school on Rosh Hashanah.,I am completely disgusted that you started school on Rosh Hashanah. I am done donating alumni money to the school. And I would respectfully ask that you don‚Äôt give the canned response.,Shame on my alma mater!,Best wishes Praful Das,Dawn Metzger,I guess inclusivity isn‚Äôt a value anymore.,Have a great 1st day Mackenzie Njos,Ava Yablonski,Alana Miller üòä,Sad that students had to choose between their religion and their first day of classes. Sad this FB page is censoring this comment.,Daniel Kraus üòÄüòÄüòÄ,To those who are hurt by the decision to start on this day::: you have every right to be. But keep in mind that the person on the other side of the screen doing social media did not make the decision. They may even be Jewish and/or not agree with the U of M on this. Or maybe it's a student on a job program. Don't make personal attacks or call for dismissal for giving the best response they have available to them. Instead::: put that anger toward finding out how you can ensure your voice is heard in the next decision.,Have a great senior year Owen Manthe,Alex üëçüèª,Expectations for the University of Minnesota continue to go downhill. The U fails on many fronts and this just adds to it. No more donations::: no more support. Apologies by form letter not accepted.,Where I learned how to stand in line for everything September 1973. Never thought I'd still need that skill today as an old lady . Hi Goldy !!!,I just looked out of curiosity. University of Wisconsin started a day later because of Rosh Hashana. They have the same academic requirements as the University of Minnesota. Their six days of final exams run through December 23. So not only can it be done::: it in fact was done! WHERE IS YOUR RESPONSE TO THIS University of Minnesota Twin Cities?!!,Michael Yu have a great yearüòò,First day of classes on a Jewish Holiday is very disrespectful. Canned responses shows how little you care. You need a new social media team. Also::: putting Classical and Near East Studies in Nicholson Hall is pretty bad. The man that building is named after helped Hitler justify killing 6 million Jews.,You fell short today::: U of M. https:// www.startribune. com/ some-minnesota-s chools-change-f irst-day-of-202 1-22-school-yea r-due-to-rosh-h ashana/ 600025137/,Why is goldy not wearing a mask?

However::: I comment here for another reason. It is with great dismay that I understand you are hosting a series called ""Deconstructing and Decentralizing Whiteness""::: to teach white people to ""recover and reclaim our humanity."" Apparently it is a 12 step process like Alcoholics Anonymous. The very foundation of the cousre is morally wrong in every way. It labels::: indicts and condemns peole based on the color of their skin. It ignores all intentions and action and treats people as a ""white collective"" ignoring their individuality. Such teaching::: as favored by Robin DiAngelo is heresy - not against a religion::: but against humanity. It reduces people to living breathing representations of their skin color - all of whom have been judged as white supremacists. While I know its in fashion to pretend anti-racism is against racism (it's not - it actually REQUIRES discrimination) and the pressure to meet the demands of a vocal few is tremendous::: please reconsider. This course promotes racism::: and demeans people based on skin color. All of which promote racism. If it is wholly voluntary and all students and all teachers are 100% free to criticize it openly::: it likely presents no legal issue::: but is morally wrong. Deeply disturbing. A path away from unity - leaving only division.",Congrats! üí™ Well done!,Guess who was happy the colleges & universities closed:  https:// apple.news/ A0MQRzW7BRfiZfhx qPNcciQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Happy Memorial Day! As you enjoy the long weekend::: remember to thank the U.S. service members in your life and honor those who have fallen. #UMNProud,2020-05-25 15:01:43,So::: not to nitpick::: but if you're going to post a pic of flags to commemorate Memorial Day they should be depicted at *half-staff*. No offense::: but I honestly thought that was common knowledge.,"Memorial Day = for those who served and no longer with us Veterans Day= for those who served and still with us Armed Services Day = for those currently serving  Also it's not supposed to be a ""happy"" day::: it's for somber remembrance of those who have died...",My kids will NEVER go to your dangerous and crime ridden School. Government should pull all money from you::: immediately. Dump of a University.,I guess you aren't honoring the Minneapolis police department heroes...becaus e of a few bad eggs...like banning the entire police department...in cluding bomb sniffing training...well if that isn't cutting your nose off to spite your face::: I don't know what is...dumb move::: Joan Gabel.,Thanks to the #heroes who have made the ultimate sacrifice to the nation so that today we can enjoy the freedom! üá∫üá∏,Nice,This thread is hysterical::: see how the liberals get all tangled up trying to include and exclude who to honor on what day. This ain't rocket science::: folks.,Carol Dulski,Love you Minnesota,Jesus people::: you find even THIS to complain about? You all need to get a damn hobby or something.,I think the comments are valid and a changed wording would improve the Memorial Day holiday objective.  But I am going to thank my friends and family who served. I have so very many and am thankful they are alive to join in the remembrance of their fellow service personnel who died in service. And I‚Äôll do it on Veterans Day too! We are so very blessed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

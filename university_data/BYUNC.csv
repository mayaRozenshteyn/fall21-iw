"**CONTENT WARNING: THIS ARTICLE ADDRESSES TEENAGE SUICIDALITY**

If you or someone you know is in crisis::: you can call the National Suicide Prevention Hotline 24 hours a day: 1-800-273-8255. More resources available here: https://caps.byu.edu/community-resources

Researchers from BYU::: Johns Hopkins::: and Harvard have created an algorithm that can predict suicidal thoughts and behavior among teens with 91% accuracy. The team said the implications of the research are critical for prevention programming and policy making. Specifically::: they hope policymakers use the findings to prepare services::: resources::: and assessments aimed at school::: community and family settings.

This study identified three risk factors that are the leading predictors of suicidal thoughts and behavior among teenagers: being threatened or harassed through digital media; being picked on or bullied by a student at school; exposure or involvement in serious arguments and yelling at home.

‚ÄúClearly the results speak to the need for prevention and schools may be the best place to start by helping to mitigate bullying and online harassment:::"" said study coauthor Carl Hanson::: professor of public health at BYU. ""For communities::: we need programming that can help support and strengthen the family.‚Äù

BYU algorithm accurately predicts when teens likely to have suicidal thoughts::: behavior",11/17/2021 17:18,"The algorithm doesn't sound that accurate. 91% accurate means that of 100 teens that it identifies as suicidal 9 actually aren't. And then of the 91 that are accurately diagnosed::: I'd assume a large portion of them are obviously struggling and this tool didn't add new information.

I would hate to have a parent or school counselor call me in to talk about my misdiagnosed suicidal thoughts. Potential users of this are going to forget very quickly that it has an error rate.

"Cougars Win! COUGARS WIN!!!!
#GoCougs BYU Football",9/12/2021 5:47,Thank you for that great game! I loved watching it here in Germany,What a game!!!! Goooooo Cougars!!!!,GO COUGARS!!!!! I am so excited and. Happy!!!!!!,Way to go Cougars! Great game!,"RISE and SHOUT....
the COUGARS are OUT!!!",Wish I could have been there to storm the field. Great game! Go cougars!!! üíô,I know someone who gave me his cougars sweatshirt::: I still have it now. And I know if given a chance::: he‚Äôll be a great asset to the team. I still care about him::: and I‚Äôll always do.,That was a great game love it go cougs,Defense won the game hands down! Glad they got aggressive finally.,Awesome game! Way to go BYU!,That was a great game by BYU. Well played. I got a feeling it's going to he another special season.,Great win! Clean game by both teams. What this rivalry should continue to be.,They played a great game! Congrats!,Go BYU::: lots of cheering from my house in Oregon!!!!,Great game with good sportsmanship by the players. Props to both teams for a game well played!,YES!!! YES!!! Wish we were there in Provo. Incredible weekend for BYU football.,Watched in our church clothes after zoom church in Australia. Me and the boys loved every minute of it. GOOOOO COUGARS üëèüëèüëè,Proud of my BYU BLUE! üíôüíôüíô,Defense did a great job as well as offense. Great game.,"This is great::: and all::: congratulations
to them for their hard work::: but I wish there was more emphasis by the school on reforming and modernizing the learning process than rooting for a football team. As a student::: just saying::: I'd rather have a better educational experience than a better football team. School needs better presentation on education::: especially online educational experiences which is most of the school right now. Not to take away from the victory::: but I might as well say it",My son saw his first BYU victory over the yewts!!!!!,Great game and fantastic win! But next week...,FINALLY. What an awesome game!,Took a Hall at QB to break the Max Hall curse. So poetic,Finally! Ended that twelve year streak.,I see this as a 1 game winning streak!,Embarrassing for coach whittingham his team looks disorganized and not prepared for this season. Could t get 10 wins and I‚Äôm sure that coach would have like to have that under his watch as coach and now we will never see it happen. Weird time for Ute football best of luck for this season. I don‚Äôt think anyone will ever see 10 in a row. Turning a page in state history.,Rise and shout!!! üôåüèªüôåüèªüôåüèª,Provo is rejoicing tonight! Nice to see the school spirit. Reminds me of the old days.,We prayed for moisture and ended the drought!!! Letttsssss goooooooo,Big XII football is just too physical for the Utes,Yay great football game BYU!!! Loved it!,Finally got our Cinderella Story ending. Rain to end that red red drought.,Looks like the Utes started paying THEIR tithing. :),Really fun game to be at!!! Great job to this team who finally ended the losing streak!!,I've been married to a U fan for 13 years. Until tonight we've only won once. So happy to be the one cheering this time!!!,It was honestly a very well played game. If we can play Broncos how we played Utah::: it will be an easy win. We need Jaren Hall for this one now that he's all rested up!,Great game all around::: every single player or coach that participated. But Jaren Hall is the man.,I am close to tears!!! It‚Äôs just before 8:00am here in Heidelberg and I just woke up the entire town!!!,Jared Hall played incredible. While his stats were not particularly flashy::: he made great decisions and didn't turn it over. The future is bright for that young man. However::: our defense really shined tonight. What an incredible effort tonight,I predicted BYU to win by 10 points. OK so I was off by 1 point. Great win!,It feels so good! I was already so happy with the Big 12 news. This is a big fat RED cherry on top of this weekend! Ha!,Wasn't that an unusual downpour?,What has it been like 742 days since Utah last beat BYU in football üòÇ,What was the score?,Good win for the Cougars! Too bad the head coach was acting the fool at the end of the game.,So happy right now. Best coaching I‚Äôve seen from BYU in years. Way to keep pressuring on defense and the offense scored when it was needed. Go Cougars!!!,Gives a small amount of validation to the power 5 call up. New chapter ahead for the program and it‚Äôs looking good ‚ù§Ô∏è,Yay! Go Cougars! I bet the University of Utah hates that I showed up with my family with the three of us wearing blue out of the five of us. We sat in the front of the Union cheering and singing. It felt so good leaving at halftime leading and now we win. Wahoo! Nicely done.,Great win BYU!,What a great game! üéâ,Yeah!!!!!!! Breaking out the blue for church and work!!!,Awesome game Cougars!!,Way to go. Great winüíôüíôüíôüíô,Go cougars! (Now keep it going!),Hats off cougars.. respect.,Way to go my Cougs üíôüíôüíô!,"Congratulations

And beat the Yewts besides!,"Heck yes finallyyyyyyyyy

There wasn't much defence in this game by either team.,LETS GO PATS üèà,BYU ON MINES.,Nothing like winning The Polygamy War!,üíôüíôüíôüíô,What a great game way to go Cougars üëèüëèüëèüíô,Such a great game! Way to go Cougars!,Are you guys going to play against Army this season? GO ARMY!!!,YAHOOOOOO the BOGUS (BIG * notation) is over I am pretty sure BYU played a much tougher schedule over the last 9 years than Utah did before every rivalry match...now with BYU likely to OWN RECRUITING BYU will OWN the U from NOW ON !,Way to go Cougars! Congrats! üèàüéâ,Denny Hill,üíôüíôüíôüíôüíôüíôüíôüíôüíôüíô,Wahoo,Karen Marie Harr,RISE & SHOUT!!!,Hang Your Head and Sulk: Utah cheer.,There Back!,"https://

"OFFICIAL: Brigham Young University has accepted an invitation to join the Big 12 Conference.

‚ÄúThis is a historic day for BYU Athletics ‚Äì and for the entire university:::‚Äù said Kevin J Worthen::: BYU president. ‚ÄúThe BYU mission statement indicates that BYU is a place where ‚Äòa commitment to excellence is expected.‚Äô We strive to meet that requirement in all we do::: including our core academic enterprise. Membership in the Big 12 gives us the opportunity to reinforce that commitment for student-athletes::: allowing them to compete at the highest level both on and off the field.‚Äù

It's awesome y'all are coming to the Big 12!!,Just beat Utah,Will be glad to have games not starting so late at night,Welcome from a KU fan!!,OF COURSE!

Last time around they should have just been honest and said it's all about the money::: rather than making a scapegoat of said beliefs and policies.",BEAT UTAH!!!,Thank god. Independent was the WORST mistake.,Great! Now make BYU Rugby (Men's and Woman's) a scholarship sport!,"Ehü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

UVU wrestles in the Big 12::: so we have an in-state rival ready to go.,"I'm wondering what some of the new rivalries should be called...

TCU vs BYU vs Baylor -\-\ The Holy Trinity Trophy?
Houston vs BYU -\-\ the Cougar Challenge?
WVU vs BYU -\-\ the Mountains Cup?",üíôüíôüíô,Can we agree to not get Big 12 bumper stickers? It was annoying when Utah did it::: and it'll still be annoying now.,From a WVU fan welcome to the Big 12.

Not sure if we will play each other often::: depending on how the divisions work out.,Homophobia can‚Äôt stop BYU! Woo! üôÉ,"just a small observation to the author of the linked column: under the ""Football Accomplishments

"#EnterToLearnGoForthToServe BYU is a major partner in a new $14.6-million project to expand treatment and research on Alzheimer‚Äôs disease and dementia in American Indian::: Alaska Native::: Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander groups.

Although these communities are culturally and geographically diverse::: they all experience an unequal burden of conditions such as hypertension::: type 2 diabetes and low socioeconomic status that make dementia more likely. In addition::: life expectancy is increasing for these groups::: and the number of older adults is climbing. There is growing concern that Alzheimer‚Äôs disease and related dementias may become a major public health crisis.

A Thing of Beauty: BYU‚Äôs Own Mr. Rogers (aka Dorie Haws) on the Honesty of Children

Children aren‚Äôt brutally honest::: explains Dorie Haws::: head teacher at the BYU Child and Family Studies Lab. They‚Äôre just calling it how they see it! Taking her cue from Mister Rogers::: Haws has found that learning to listen and really understanding children leads to inspiring findings: the complexity of their minds::: the beauty of having no filter::: and the strength of their connection to God.

"BYU biology graduate student Natalie Saxton is part of a team of BYU biologists that has been tracking down dragonflies around the world::: from Vietnam to the islands of Vanuatu. Their goal is to piece together the first-ever phylogenic (genealogical) tree of all 6:::300 known dragonfly species and their ancestors.

Funded by the National Science Foundation::: the phylogenic tree will enable scientists to study how different species of dragonfly evolved over time through changes in characteristics like vision and flight::: which may in turn illuminate how other animals speciate.

Both the novelty and the usefulness of the work has been thrilling for the scientists.

‚ÄúYou kind of feel like one of your biology heroes:::‚Äù said Saxton::: ‚Äúgoing out into the wilderness at the edge of the world to find new species.‚Äù

"Immigrant communities such as a Jewish settlement in Clarion and a Thai community in Layton may not be as well-known or remembered but still play an important part of Utah‚Äôs history ‚Äî a history rich with diverse stories of faith and perseverance. With the passage of time::: however::: many of the stories of Utah‚Äôs immigrants are on the verge of being lost.

BYU history professor and Associate Director of the BYU Redd Center::: Brenden W. Rensink::: hopes to change that through a new website and mobile app called Intermountain Histories ‚Äî a platform dedicated to highlighting significant places and people who helped shape the history of the Intermountain West. The project is managed and edited by Rensink while students from multiple regional universities contribute individual stories.

""Too often we stop with the most obvious histories::: or the histories that we grew up hearing::: and we never pause to ask::: ‚ÄòWhat else is out there?‚Äô‚Äù Rensink states. ‚ÄúThere are infinitely more perspectives::: voices and stories that we haven‚Äôt heard than ones we have::: and you don‚Äôt have to dig very far to find them.‚Äù

"As social media and other online networking sites have grown in usage::: so too has trolling - an internet practice in which users intentionally seek to draw others into pointless and::: at times::: uncivil conversations.

New BYU research sheds light on the motives and personality characteristics of internet trolls. This research found that individuals who experienced pleasures from the failings or shortcomings of others considered trolling to be acceptable online behavior. Because of this view::: they're not concerned with how their words or actions affect those on the other side of the screen.

BYU communication professor and co-author of this study::: Dr. Pamela Brubaker said::: ""As we connect with people online::: we should strive to be more respectful of others and other points of view. [...] Each of us has the power to be an influence for good online.""

Because for them::: that is positive reinforcement to continue their behavior. I also think that there is some confusion on the definition of ""trolling:::"" I wish the video had talked about that before delving into the outcomes of their research.",Trolling is not pointless. If executed properly::: its purpose is to satirize and expose foolish views in front of an online audience.,"Um::: who gets to decide what constitutes pointless conversations::: Pamela? I know that's a base you and yours would love to steal::: calling all those who disagree with you trolls. Unfortunately::: I think we'll deny you that right.

Trolling is characterized by the state of mind of the troller::: not the trollee. If the person making a contradictory argument has no desire to have a true exchange of ideas but rather::: gets his or her jollies from winding up others::: then you have a troller. Your discussion of Dark Triad::: which is actually a tired::: unhelpful::: faddish ""diagnosis:::"" might have some merit.

If the person making a contradictory comment is truly intending to contend with a tough::: controversial topic::: you do NOT have a troll. You have someone who disagrees with you::: whose opposition and arguments cannot be blithely dismissed. Certainly::: you CAN dismiss that opposition . . . with better arguments.",It doesn't matter how stupid or illogical the things you say are::: we should defend the right for you to say them.

Fall semester 2021 will operate like a traditional fall semester due to the downward trend in COVID-19 infections and increased number of vaccinations within the campus community.

BYU will also be evaluating how virtual learning may have improved some elements of courses and curricula and hopes to incorporate the best of those changes as it prepares for a more traditional fall semester.

Masks and physical distancing will not be required during fall semester. This decision is subject to change depending on trends in disease prevalence and guidance from state and local governments. Individuals may choose to wear a mask in any setting.

Bates‚Äô passion for wildlife stretches back to his childhood years::: where he fondly recalls spending summers living in the mountains and working with his father::: the game manager for Utah‚Äôs Division of Wildlife Resources.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs where I developed a love for the outdoors and for all creatures:::‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI knew then that I wanted to be a wildlife biologist.‚Äù

"Now a successful fourth-year business Ph.D. student at the University of Michigan::: BYU alumna Hilary Hendricks can remember earlier days when‚Äîhaving moved her family across the country to attend a top program‚Äîshe felt herself unequal to the challenges of doctoral study. What kept her going were her mentors from her previous time as a BYU MBA student.

‚ÄúI‚Äôd be walking across campus in Ann Arbor thinking::: ‚ÄòThere‚Äôs just no way I can do this.‚Äô But then ... I would recite to myself all of the professors at BYU who helped me to get where I was:::"" says Hendricks.

The excellent preparation Hendricks received for graduate school is reflected in data from the National Science Foundation::: which shows that BYU prepares more future Ph.D. students in both business management and foreign languages than any other university in the United States. The data also shows that BYU graduates have outsized success completing doctoral programs in a host of other areas::: including chemical engineering::: education research::: mechanical engineering and psychology.

BYU has long been recognized as a top school for preparing future doctoral students::: ranking sixth in the nation for the number of students who go on to earn doctoral degrees::: according to the federally sponsored Survey of Earned Doctorates. From 2009 to 2018::: 3:::040 former BYU students completed a Ph.D.::: an average of about 300 per year.

"Spencer Larsen::: a BYU senior who serves as one of four vice presidents in the BYU Student Service Association::: said that this semester‚Äîone of the most unique in the school's history‚Äîhas been the most fulfilling of his academic career. This is all due to a new initiative that morphed the BYUSA office into a production facility focusing entirely on making and delivering COVID care packages to fellow BYU students.

The idea came from BYU freshman Emily Seals::: a volunteer with BYUSA::: who herself was experiencing the isolation of quarantine early in the semester. She contacted Larsen::: expressing the need to help their peers who were in similar situations. Seals created an online survey that allowed BYU students who were experiencing isolation to virtually connect with other students and request a care package to be delivered to their doorstep. So far::: over 800 care packages have been delivered to students in various situations and new requests continue to come in.",4/2/2021 21:12,God bless y'all!

"After careful consideration of the present circumstances and in an effort to comply with federal::: state and Church guidelines::: the decision has been made for BYU‚Äôs commencement ceremonies on April 22::: 2021::: to be held virtually. The commencement exercises and speeches will be broadcast live on BYUtv from the Marriott Center.

‚ÄúThis decision was not made lightly::: and we know how disappointing this news may be for you and your loved ones:::‚Äù said BYU Academic Vice President Shane Reese. ‚ÄúWe look forward::: however::: to the opportunity to recognize our outstanding students as graduates with perhaps ‚Äòless pomp::: but more circumstance.‚Äô Our COVID circumstances have provided opportunities for unique recognitions that are commensurate with our truly remarkable graduates.‚Äù

More details about the specific commencement program as well as convocations will be announced shortly. In the meantime::: all things graduation can be found at graduation.byu.edu.",2/24/2021 15:22,With a 99.991% survivability rate this makes complete sense to fear. You know::: because fear is clearly more powerful than faith.,So glad that BYU cares about the health of the grads and their families. IÔ∏è wish more people would show that they care. #maskup,This is ridiculous. The risk to the students is so minimal of getting sick::: that they should be living their lives as normal::: other than avoiding people risk categories. Those people in risk categories could watch the ceremonies virtually. With social distancing and smaller crowds there should be so little risk especially in April. By then there will be so many vaccinations and reduced numbers of infection that not having graduation is going to look like an unnecessary sacrifice.,Hilarious::: 4 years of hard work with tens of thousands of dollars invested. It‚Äôs like running a marathon only to get to the end and cross a finish line that‚Äôs been packed up and put away.,So we can have the super bowl and other large gatherings but not graduation? This is so pathetic. Big important life events are reduced to virtual üò•,Then why are the temples reopening. We just had a superbowl (did thousands die)? When can we try to move on? Why are students allowed on campus::: dorms and classrooms?,"I feel like there were more choices here besides just Option A) Hold regular graduation and Option B) Don't hold regular graduation. We could have limited the in-person ceremony to graduates only (approx 4:::300 according to the web - and if 6:::000 people can come to a football game::: 4300 grads can come to the stadium and walk) with families joining virtually. We could have rapidly tested all graduates 24-48 before graduation and those with a positive test stay home. We could have opted for multiple ceremonies across three days with sanitizing in between...or here's a thought! Do ALL the things! We've implemented and are already working within so many safety measures for school/church/
travel::: I'm not sure why we're not using them here?!","The Lord has prepared the strongest people for these::: the hardest days of this earth. Congratulations
to the class of 2021! You will go down in history as one of the finest and the bravest. No virus or the lack of ceremonies can take away the efforts and hard work you have endured til this day. You are much stronger for it. Life is changing for everyone. Those with eyes to see::: can see it. Keep up the good work! Go forward in faith and the blessings of prosperity awaits you::: no matter how hard things may be today. üëèüåà‚ù§Ô∏è","This makes me so sad. I graduate this June and feel robbed of my experience. But I understand why they are doing it and I‚Äôd rather forgo this event if it means people are safe.especially
older family members who might want to attend.",Wow. There really is zero courage left in the world. Weak and Pathetic decision.,"Honestly::: if you believe in the Mormon faith and don‚Äôt believe that Covid-19 is real or deadly::: then I can see where you might think that your graduation ceremony is more important! Wow. Woke??? You have a long long way to go. Congratulations
on your graduation::: college is an accomplishment.
You might want to thank the people that afforded you that luxury and show them why you were able to do it::: instead of whining about a ceremony that most folks want to skip.
Covid -19 can be a deadly illness and should be taken seriously.",After careful consideration of the fact that Communists have taken over the country through subterfuge and that we as a University want to fly below the radar as long as possible so we can continue to operate without being attacked::: the decision has been made to have a virtual graduation.,"‚ÄúOur Covid circumstances‚Äù.
.. aren‚Äôt you done beating that tired::: EXHAUSTED horse?

Hold the graduation and let people decide for themselves who will attend and who won‚Äôt.

You know::: like that crazy agency thing??","I graduate this semester. I rather be done with COVID than attending in-person ceremony.
The risk of skyrocketing the case and losing more lives to COVID is not worth the graduation ceremony. This is how I see it - welcome to disagree with my point of view.",Sad. Missed my daughter‚Äôs HS graduation last year and now can‚Äôt attend my son‚Äôs college graduation. First child to graduate from college.,"Insert eye roll again. I‚Äôm done::: we are all actually done::: really just done. Driving/
Traffic deaths still rise over 1.3 million per year world wide and yet...nothing but crickets called tickets in our country. Nearly 10:::000 in the US alone are alcohol related and prohibition has yet to set in. Car Crashes kill us and others around you a whole lot faster. So why no moratorium for driving? Some virus they recognize nationally as ‚Äúcreated‚Äù and we do nothing literally nothing except lock up everyone who isn‚Äôt the problem. We lock up the good people::: the uninflected::: and we stuff our old folks into nursing homes so they can get sick and die. 100% equivalent to throwing them into a taxi with a drunk driver and hoping they make it home ok. Enough.",Thank you BYU::: for taking the lead in this and planning a safe alternative. Although many will be unhappy with this::: it is the correct decision in the midst of an ongoing pandemic. I appreciate this! And congrats to the graduates! Your graduation may not be the traditional one::: but you will be celebrated amongst your peers and family for your hard work.,BYU professor here. Of course I‚Äôm saddened and disappointed by this news. I always delight in seeing families enjoy graduation festivities. However::: to those at odds with the university‚Äôs decision or who feel as though this is a slap in the face at the very end of your BYU experience::: I personally take that as a slap in the face as well. I would hope your most cherished take-away from higher education would be the education. I‚Äôm considering what circumstances would otherwise warrant virtual or cancelled commencement - would we move forward into our fields of work or further study after graduation with the knowledge and positivity a BYU grad should have::: or sulk? Most scheduled large gatherings of any kind have been cancelled until either late summer or fall of this year. BYU is not alone. Don‚Äôt single us out.,Thank you! I support this decision completely.,"I earned a masters degree from BYU in 1976. In those days we had to have permission to skip the graduation ceremonies. I had other responsibilitie
s and chose to get that permission. I had my memories and my diploma - my ticket to the career I wanted. In the 45 years since then::: I have never regretted missing all the pomp and circumstance.",BYU is coming out of my will. To be sure it was only in as a contingency but even that token will be removed.,You‚Äôre not keeping anyone safe. You‚Äôre just another institution trying to have good PR and not ruffle any woke mob feathers. Those that don‚Äôt want to get Covid and don‚Äôt want to be at a commencement won‚Äôt go... those that want to go should be able to go. Simple as that. As someone who‚Äôs graduating‚Äî don‚Äôt expect a single cent from me as an alumni.,It is a very American thing I see in these comments about the low risk to the young students. The idea that everyone should be able to just make decisions about themselves and not care if it hurts anyone else. The myopic narcissism is pretty astonishing. Yes those students will almost certainly survive from covid if they catch it in a superspreader celebration of themselves. But the grandparents they have dinner with might not::: the patient of the nurse they spread it to in the grocery store might not. I have patients with disabilities who have not left their homes in a year. But when community rates get high thanks to low risk people who don‚Äôt think beyond themselves - nurses catch it in the community::: doctors catch it::: people that others people with disabilities literally cannot live without catch it. Then the most careful::: the most vulnerable will catch it and die. For a religion based on community and helping the ‚Äòleast‚Äô it certainly has fully moved to the American ideal of I‚Äôve got mine - everything else is your problem. It‚Äôs kind of disgusting.,What efforts has BYU made to oppose draconian::: ineffective::: and unscientific lockdown policies at the state and federal level?,At this rate just make BYU an online school if they‚Äôre going to lock us down forever like this,I didn't even go to my college graduation. I just wanted to start my career and get moving.,It‚Äôs starting to feel like the liberals in the church run the show. Oh well::: whatever. The rest of us don‚Äôt have to live in fear!,Bummer...this is the year I have my last TWO kids graduating BYU. It‚Äôs the end of an era for us. Very disappointing.,I am sure that decision was made by a Prophet of God!!!,Seems like some creativity could be used here. Use the outdoor stadium::: let students be in person::: broadcast it for older family members or others not comfortable attending::: have the big ceremony virtual and smaller ceremonies in person. So many things could be done besides just making the whole thing virtual. It's so sad for these kids. Put some creative students in charge of planning instead of fearful adults and you might be surprised what you get.,I know this is very disappointing to so many::: but thank you for making this tough decision responsibly.,death rate of 20ish yr olds .002! BYU I'm ashamed of you.,Church needs to go ahead and break ties with BYU like they did scouts. BYU is commie and liberal viewed anyway...,Extremely sad and disappointed in BYU. Wish they could have at least done something like this for us graduates last year (2020).,This is a major experience of college. Not getting the full experience should not get the full tuition.,The most special moment from my graduation is when they asked grads to turn and look at the people in the crowd who helped them get here. Hopefully this year's grads can create a moment like that with a little creativity.,If they've been able to be on campus all year::: they should be able to have an in person graduation.,Weird that people are losing their minds about this yet the general authorities and apostles announced general conference will be virtual and not a peep ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,I would better be able to support this decision if they were not just starting to allow fans into games to watch. Why can athletes have people in the stands but students can‚Äôt even have a graduation ceremony where they are the only ones present?,"Honestly::: this is best thing that can happen to commencements.

You can mute out the speakers you don't want to hear. You can stay in regular clothes. You won't have to spend money on graduation robes. And then you can leave from your house to go out to eat and celebrate.

No long line of people walking to the stage to get a diploma case and a quick picture.",The most important way to end time spent getting a degree at BYU is receiving the degree. Excited for my BIL to finish up this spring and happy to celebrate with him virtually!,A lot of people will be vaccinated by then. Why don‚Äôt you consider holding the event outside? Online truly is not the same. Graduation day for me was a multi-sensory experience: the sounds of people shuffling in their robes::: the air on my smiling cheeks as I walked across the bridge into the Marriott Center. It was an unforgettable joyous day.,Not sure why BYU couldn‚Äôt do smaller department graduations!,This is ridiculous. We can go to Walmart and Costco every week but can‚Äôt have graduation ceremonies? This is insanity.,"Use the money saved for all the regalia for your private celebration. Treat yourself to something special. Congratulations
! On enduring to the end!","This is good! Thank you.
Stop complaining everyone. It makes you sound so spoiled and it's gross. I didn't have a junior high::: or high school graduation. I was really looking forward to college::: but guess what? We are in the middle of a pandemic. Do your part and stop complaining. There are people dying. Still.","Regardless::: isn't it interesting that the Pandemic no longer applies to Air Travel? I mean::: not really.
It's okay to cram 100 people into a flying metal tube::: without social distancing::: because the masks really do work. Right?
Now Wait! Think about it!",Time to move on and open up! Life goes on!,You can feel sad and upset about not having the experience while still understanding why this is happening! I‚Äôm supposed to walk in April::: but now I don‚Äôt have the grand experience::: and I am sad about it. But::: I also want me and my family to be safe. Life is about sacrifices::: and this is one of them. Take pictures in your cap and gown in front of all the BYU signs and walk around campus taking in your last days there. It will be okay.,Since Covid is the 3rd leading cause of death in the US::: and it's contagious::: this decision is necessary ... even though it's disappointing.,This makes me sad. My sister in law is a registered nurse working at a front range local IHC hospital They have no dedicated wing/area for COVID patients any more. If someone comes in with symptoms they are treated and taken care of. If the sick can be treated like this then the well should be treated like this.,Way to be a follower and not a leader BYU way to have fear over faith. Way to teach this future generation to act like sheep. EVERYTHING against all we have been taught. This all with a 99.991% survival. Can‚Äôt imagine what decisions you would make with a real crisis. What a disappointment you are,Take a stand for something::: BYU! This is ridiculous. You don‚Äôt accept federal funds for a reason. You do it so you don‚Äôt have to follow federal guidelines or federal mandates. Stop trying to be like the rest of the universities in this country. It‚Äôs good to be different and to go against the prevailing winds of state control.,I don‚Äôt even remember who spoke at my graduation! What I do remember is the great work I was able to do because of my education! Pomp and circumstance don‚Äôt really mean a lot!,By the end of April::: infection rates will have dropped significantly (like they already have) and many more of us will be vaccinated. Don't act like this decision is based on science. It's based on fear of the woke leftist mob's backlash. Such a massive shame. I'm glad to be done with BYU because they seem to go downhill every year when they make decisions that cater to the left's ideology.,If you‚Äôre not graduating this April::: do not comment on here about how you‚Äôre happy for BYU. No one cares. You‚Äôre not graduating.,"Boring exercise in Mammon‚Äôs honors anyway. Zion or bust.

But congrats to the grads who actually sought learning by study and faith out of the best books. Now::: go build up Zion. üôè","Lest we forget::: graduation was held virtually last year too. Now we have two years worth of BYU graduates who didn‚Äôt physically attend a ceremony. I get it. It‚Äôs disappointing. But life is full of disappointments
. You pick yourself up and move on. Be grateful you are part of the few who get to graduate at all.","So faith in the vaccine and almost half of the country infected and survived isn't enough to get back to normal....?!?!
üòíü§≥üèº",Folks::: it‚Äôs about time spent with others that might be exposed or sick. I still see no intelligence about real science or illness. I say this is a good way to discover if your religious believes are right or not. Dear God::: preserve the feeble minded. Amen. It makes me angry that people do not believe that this is a true illness with potential for grave outcomes if you do t protect yourself and your family. It Has NOTHING TO DO WITH POLITICS!!!! Please listen.,So much fear. BYU graduates are nearly all young.,I was clearly born 20 years too early. Kids these days are so spoiled ü§£,This for the age group lest likely to have any problems from covid and those that are could use their brain and not go. PC everywhere are they afraid of public opinion?,But yet congregations are holding in person church all over the state? Inside a building? Why don't they just spread it out over a week like they were considering. This is just ridiculous. If everyone makes up it would be fine. Have you been to a Costco on Saturday? This is just mind bending. And people are just going to hold grad parties right afterwards. Come on. SMH.,Just another example of the admin putting fans who donate to them above the actual students. Sports get spectators::: the fans and donors are kept happy. Absolutely no reason BYU couldn't make an effort to have a socially distanced graduation! The only ones who NEED to be there are the seniors. This is just a public show that they are doing something with the pandemic::: anyone on campus knows social distancing and masks are a joke.,My daughter didn‚Äôt even get a commencement last year. I‚Äôm glad they‚Äôre doing something.,Definitely an upgrade from last year! Good to see responsible and supportive choices being made.,How about you do both? Virtual and in person. Let people choose!!,Good for you! It's not like you need to have a ceremony to have a valid degree. Doesn't show on a resume.,"But look at the bright side...now you can save money not traveling...and
you don‚Äôt have to post later about: ‚ÄúMy word::: if I have to attend another graduation-type
ceremony it will be too soon!‚Äù üòâüëç","People there are so many horrible things happening in the world right now to all kinds of people::: believe me you are all blessed to a degree that you don't even know.
Please STOP complaining. Just appreciate.",Why make this decision now? Heck mask mandates will be gone by April,You allow students to attend basketball games but not willing to hold commencement or convocation ceremonies. How sad that these are your priorities. Our only child graduates next month and you have robbed all of us of this important experience.,So glad the traffic jams associated with BYU commencement will not be happening this year. That virtual thing has virtue! Thanks!,Sorry üòû I did not go to my BYU graduation and it is one of the life regrets. But hopefully the impacted students will have really fun celebrations with lived ones to compensate.,I hope that small convocations can happen. Even if it is just the graduates in person and everyone else virtual. These kids have worked so hard and need to be celebrated!,well the good news is there will be significantly less robes of a false priesthood this year. The bad news is that it was done in the name of another false priesthood...,"This entire thread makes me worried. It's like::: ""church leaders are only inspired if it follows my predetermined beliefs.""",Thanks BYU for caring about the health and wellbeing of students and faculty. Sorry for those that will not have a graduation ceremony but think about the staff members at BYU which are part of a COVID high risk group.,We live in a litigious PR world. Can you imagine the media uproar (and lawsuits) if even one case were traced to the graduation ceremony? Thank you BYU for going above and beyond to navigate this corona craziness. This Ute is a mom of a current Cougar.,While I understand this with a lot of crowd and so on::: I wish BYU has done something that Texas A&M is going to do by spreading ceremonies in a week or two span instead of in 2 days. Or maybe use the football stadium... Oh well.,This is such a heartless college. The things you make students go through on top of the graduation application almost 8 months prior for a $15 fee is insane. You all are real pieces of work. What a shame for these students who endured so much.,You should have done something like this spring 2020! Why didn‚Äôt you? Shameful!,By end of April most older adults and many::: many younger::: will have been vaccinated. I believe this is all about LAWSUITS.,"My original response to a post got deleted so I‚Äôll repost here since it applies to the murmurers here.

Sorry::: really not related to BYU::: per se..just pushed by LOGIC buttons!!!!","From my son today who will be finishing his degree next month..and won‚Äôt have a graduation ceremony:

There will officially be no in person convocations for any of the programs at BYU::: even though they just had a basketball game with over 2:::000 people present haha",This is so sad for the kids. I trust the Administration but what a tough. decision this must have been. Frustrating but understandable.,Yet basketball games can now be attended? Idk if I‚Äôm liking these priorities.,üôÑüôÑüôÑ if you're saying that BYU is run by communists based on this decision than BYU really did fail you.,So sad. This was the same last year for my granddaughter and grandson. üò£,So much better than sitting in small chairs at the Marriott. I would have been for this 5 years ago.,How can high schools and kindergartens manage graduations but colleges mail you your degree?,Gotta hide this post. When is this going to stop::: let's move already and quit living like this.,If its gonna be virtual. Why would anyone want to listen to it? Seriously! No one wants to listen to your BS talks about how it's now time to go out into the world and make it grow!,I was told that the reason there wasn‚Äôt widespread Covid events at blm protests is because they were largely outdoors and people wore masks. Logic tells me that using a similar approach here should yield a similar result. What am I missing?,Religion and science meet with intelligence. ü§©,The Study out of Sweden show transmission of Coivd from child to adult doesn't happen. This is a huge lie.,What is disappointing are all the political statements on this string. Some sifting appears to be going on here. That's certainly one of the spiritual purposes of the virus. Reminds me of the children of Israel following Moses.,"Good for them.

It also makes me worried there will be spikes again or that maybe the vaccine won‚Äôt really help.",I was in California.,‚ÄúYour will‚Äù?? We know we‚Äôll live to see the second coming. We‚Äôre both to hardheaded to die.,Yes we should comply with the government.. keep up the fear mongering,I graduated last year. It‚Äôs nice that I was mailed the piece of paper and square hat::: but after five years of college education::: I still don‚Äôt feel like I graduated. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,So sad that life's events are interrupted and changed forever it seems by this virus...,I‚Äôm losing faith in people to see the truth of the purpose of this virus. We need to just rise up and say no! The removal of freedom is killing us faster than this virus!,So we can do basketball games but not graduation?,Amazing to see so many people complaining.. Then you understand why so many people didn't believe in Christ despite witnessing His miracles... You are lucky you haven't been affected by the virus and that you haven't lost a dear friend or family member::: hopefully despite your arrogance it stays swell for you. If the ceremony means so much to you and your children::: make one in your house::: make the mistake of inviting everyone you would have invited to the commencement::: simple as that... Complaining and blaming it on the liberals won't change anything::: the decision is made::: stop being selfish.,Fear fear fear. I‚Äôm so sick of living in fear.,The virus does not warrant these extremes,I didn't finish school (thank goodness) so I could care less but GO COUGS!!! ü§£ü§£ü§£,"Was this decision made after much fasting and praying? Nope! BYU is cowering to government tyranny. So much for ""doubt not::: fear not.""",So glad that BYU cares!,Is Jim McMahon graduating ?,"So many are paranoid about the virus. The following worked ‚Äî

‚ÄúIn the 60s::: the KGB did some fascinating psychological experiments. They learned that if you bombard human subjects with fear messages nonstop::: in two months or less::: most of the subjects are completely brainwashed to believe the false message to the point that no amount of clear information they are shown to the contrary can change their mind.‚Äù

If the same response were made to this virus as with SARS1::: then it most likely would not be any worse. SARS1 is 78% identical to this virus. We have been lies to about every part of this virus. We have been and continue to be played. And you would think that BYU would know how to use common sense and logic to see what has been going on::: but the KGB experiments seem to have worked very well in all aspects of this virus.","So sorry Ally Barry ! You deserve better and so do all the other graduates. Congratulations
on your achievements! I'm so proud of you!!!!",So sad. Robbing these kids of all the hard work. They deserve to be recognized. Shame on you BYU.,No one said this would be easy.,So grateful to see science and logical thought being applied.,All the hotels and restaurants probably aren‚Äôt happy.,Dang::: well at least I don‚Äôt have to buy a cap and gown,Not to mention the entire school year has been online. All the tuition and costs but none of the experience.,What‚Äôs really sad is watching people and institutions give in to the fear. Our pioneer ancestors who endured mobocracy::: famine::: disease::: and numerous other challenges just might be hanging their heads in shame at the fear of a disease with a 98% recovery rate.,Can y'all just mail me some free stuff as compensation? lol,I didn‚Äôt even walk when I graduated üòÜ,You guys realize you're NOT paying for your kids graduation ceremony right? You are paying for their EDUCATION. An education that will allow them to be a productive human in society. I understand that formalities are really important to some people but in all reality the degree is what your child is after. Not a fun party with their friends. It's beyond unfortunate but the negative comments from parents are really petty. Good grief.,BYU caved.,Sad that BYU has to bend over to the government,The Graduation Ceremony is SO important to the graduate and family. When I finished on a serious shoestring budget::: I couldn't even afford the announcements. I have always regretted the decision not to tie that shoestring a little tighter so I could have at least sent them::: even if I couldn't do the cap and gown part. I am so sorry to hear this sad decision::: but on the other hand::: at least now the family and loved ones can attend virtually. Thanking God for the technology and asking Him to bless America!,So glad BYU cares about legal liability so they don‚Äôt get sued.,The world will not end::: even though I think that this is a bit extreme.,"Oh disheartening..
. it‚Äôs been over a year ..",If masks work.......,It‚Äôs going to be okay.,I think if you don't invite a fun guest speaker::: it probably doesn't matter.,Just pretend it's a football game,Because robbing one graduating class wasn't enough....,They need to quit bowing to the tyrants,Bought in,No wonder so many members vote democrat.,You all going to byu ...its a privileged to attend such school ...it has been my dream school but here i am. I'm about to run a post graduate program here ::: and because of this pandemic everything has gone up...so please am seeking for sponsors please ...,Gross. Puppets of the deep state 100%.,"You can pull a straw man on me if you want::: but then that defeats the point of actual debate. Here's what I think (with links and references):
(1)""Those who govern their thoughts and actions solely by the principles of liberalism or conservatism or intellectualism
cannot be expected to agree with all of the teachings of the gospel of Jesus Christ. As for me::: I find some wisdom in liberalism::: some wisdom in conservatism::: and much truth in intellectualism
‚Äîbut I find no salvation in any of them.‚Äù
(-Dallin H Oaks) This school‚Äôs selling point isn't conservative or liberal ideals::: but the Gospel of Jesus Christ.

(2) ‚ÄúIn order to complain::: you have to know there is something better available that you would prefer...but that you are not willing to take the necessary action to create. You would rather complain because it protects you from having to take the risk to create the way you want. When you complain::: what you‚Äôre really saying is:::‚ÄòI have something I prefer::: but I‚Äôm not willing to risk creating it...so I‚Äôll complain to you instead‚Äô‚ÄùIf you really want to see change::: why are you complaining on Facebook? Write to the leaders of the school explaining your case. Perhaps then you will get the answers or the change you seek.

(3) I go to BYU. I go to a school that ‚Äúis 80% cheaper than the national average private non-profit four year college tuition of $29:::191. The cost is 55% cheaper than the average Utah tuition of $12:::890 for 4 year colleges.‚Äù They are cutting me a deal financially so saying that because I paid ‚Äúlots of money‚Äù I ‚Äúdeserve‚Äù a commencement ceremony is a bit selfish. Albeit::: I am not graduating this year. However::: BYU students seem to have a much bigger stake in graduation than those who are not students in this chat...

(4) I decided to come to this University. I signed the honor code saying that I will::: ‚ÄúObey the law and follow campus policies.‚Äù Is this not a campus policy decision? It's not fair to paint this as BYU reneging on their agreement as a university::: when I am the one who is doing just that as an individual.

"The cooking sessions in BYU professor Marie Orton‚Äôs Italian 361 class represent her passion for helping students to connect‚Äîwith each other::: with her::: with the subject matter. Orton said her teaching methods are inspired partly by the examples of many colleagues in the unique language programs at BYU::: which offers its students immersive course experiences in 63 languages and which ranks third in the nation for the most bachelor degrees in a foreign language.

Orton‚Äôs fall class investigated what makes Italians ‚ÄúItalian‚Äù: how history::: politics::: sports::: fashion::: music::: literature and (of course) food create a common identity among a people who unified from a loose group of nation-states less than two hundred years ago.

Teaching a typically in-person experience‚Äîcooking as a class‚Äîinto a virtual experience is no small feat::: but Professor Orton believes it has kept the Italian mentality of cooking food together intact.

‚ÄúIn Italy::: food and group identity are inseparable:::‚Äù she explained. ‚ÄúEverybody who goes there realizes very fast::: food is about anticipating and preparing::: cooking with other people::: letting a sauce boil down for six hours and talking about it as you eat it. It‚Äôs all about what we‚Äôre doing together.‚Äù

‚ÄúOne thing that I‚Äôve loved about Professor Orton‚Äôs class is that she is really good at bringing us close to the things that we‚Äôre learning about:::‚Äù said BYU senior Emma Stucki. ‚ÄúTechnology can be a barrier sometimes::: but it was lovely to share Italian food culture as a class.‚Äù",1/26/2021 16:56,She is THE BEST!!!

My son has already decided he will not even apply to BYU for his master and my grandchildren will not attend either.

"In accordance with Utah State Public Health Order 2020-27 and the Utah System of Higher Education COVID-19 Intensive Testing Plan::: Brigham Young University students 18 years or older who live in on-campus housing or attend at least one in-person or blended class are asked to take a COVID-19 screening test during the first ten days of winter semester. These students may also be invited to participate in focused and random testing throughout the semester if selected to do so.

Similar to the voluntary testing in November and December::: BYU will be administering these COVID-19 screening tests free of charge to students who are not experiencing any symptoms and haven‚Äôt tested positive in the last 90 days.

Entry testing will run Jan. 8‚Äì20 (excluding Sundays and the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday) in the Wilkinson Student Center Garden Court and in the Richards Building. Register for a testing time at byu.edu/coronavirus/student-covid-19-testing.

If you are experiencing symptoms within this testing period::: you can receive a test at the BYU Student Health Center which will be covered by your insurance or by BYU.

In addition to this initial entry testing::: BYU will continue to require face masks and use of the Healthy Together Passport app (or the digital or physical daily passport forms) in order to access certain on-campus services and facilities::: including the Harold B. Lee Library and devotionals and forums. These rules apply even if you‚Äôve already had COVID-19.

I think it is good to get tested so that you don't have to quarantine as much.

It must be difficult to navigate this known that the state can just shut you down if you don't follow the health department guidelines. While I completely disagree with mandatory testing and masks I see the position you are in. Some classes really can't be fulfilled online only. I do hope all the universities will be more honest and forthright about what student educations might look like instead of allowing them to register for in person classes::: pay for tuition::: secure housing only to be locked in a dorm and all activities canceled when they could have stayed home for so much less or waited to take classes until they could be in person.,So what if the student tested positive over Christmas break. Do they need to show that to someone at BYU?,Are they still going to require weekly testing?,So what happens if BYU decides not to bow to the health department and decides not to test healthy people ?

Whichever one it is::: it will either help get our country more in debt and/or raise our taxes::: or it will raise the cost of student fees in the near future.

"Utah Governor Gary Herbert declared a state of emergency and issued an executive order on November 8. In addition to other statewide restrictions and requirements::: the executive order requires weekly COVID-19 testing for college students who either live on campus or attend at least one in-person class per week. Each university campus is required to have a testing process in place by January 1::: 2021.

In an effort to rapidly implement large-scale COVID-19 screening testing for students on campus::: BYU has adopted the following three-part plan for the remainder of fall semester:

1. BYU will begin student COVID-19 screening tests November 18 through November 21.

2. COVID-19 screening tests are only for current students who are not experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 and have not tested positive for COVID-19 within the last 90 days. Students who are experiencing any symptoms of COVID-19 should get tested at the BYU Student Health Center or through another healthcare provider.

3. BYU non-student employees will not be part of the COVID-19 screening tests. Faculty and staff who wish to be tested can visit coronavirus.utah.gov for information on state testing locations.

Current BYU students may volunteer to participate in these screening tests. This information will give you the opportunity to make compassionate decisions that are best for yourself::: your family::: and your friends during the Thanksgiving holiday.

Testing will take place in the Wilkinson Student Center Garden Court this Wednesday through Saturday (Nov 18‚Äì21) by appointment only. These screening tests are a ""short-swab"" nasal test::: brushing 1 inch into your nostril. Test results will be available shortly after each test is administered.

After January 1::: 2021::: this testing will be mandatory for students living in on-campus housing and students taking at least one in-person class.

Thank you for your continued efforts to protect yourself::: your loved ones::: and our BYU community.

Student COVID-19 Testing",11/16/2020 22:41,Imagine being so privileged that the only oppression you ever felt is being asked to wear a mask and get tested to be allowed on campus.,With the virus spreading at other campuses::: I think that BYU is doing the right thing. I think that it‚Äôs for the greater good and students will feel much safer being on campus. I feel like people will always complain and they can‚Äôt separate politics from the virus.,"Why? Seriously for a flu with a recovery rate of 99.8%? Are hospitalization
s due to covid trending up? No! They arent! And false positive tests::: which there are MANY not to mention the tests where one nostril tests positive and the other negative?
BYU is SO concerned that all BYU gyms are still closed EXCEPT for anyone on a school team. (Is that not the epitome of hypocrisy?) All of which have been seen not wearing masks or social distancing! Gym access is part of tuition! Is there going to be reimbursement for those students NOT participating on a school team? The mandatory testing is another ridiculous overreach for what end? What is your end game? To have all classes online only? Online classes do NOT allow the same learning experience as IN person classes! I am sick of hearing ""if you dont want testing::: its your choice to live off campus"" BULL. BYU is turning out to be another crappy woke liberal thinking University! How sad for the LDS students.",The comments here make me question the value of my byu education. I just gave my weekly national covid briefing this afternoon. The correlation between states mask compliance and increasing rates of infection was striking. The exponential infection rate will be followed in 2 weeks by an exponentially increasing number of deaths. Low mask compliance can‚Äôt be fixed with a weekly test but it is a start and marginally better than nothing. It is astonishing to me to see Americans failing the basic Darwinian standard of self preservation. I don‚Äôt think it will sink in for some people until they lose people they love.,Thanks God::: I'm doing my program online::: perhaps the campus students should take precautions,BYU is becoming a joke.,"I would like the administration address the rationale of not having a few thousand fans at LES that holds 65:::000. We all know what the mandate is::: but what is the basis behind that edict? USU had more students at an indoor game this last week.

It's find to have rules::: but at least explain it to the fans.",Literally there‚Äôs been 2 vaccines announced y‚Äôall. Chill,We can't get him out fast enough,Seems to me that maybe they should have told us the truth. I don't believe anything they say anymore.,Sounds like a money maker for the Covid test companies. Someone should check to be sure no one is getting a kick back!,"I feel so sorry for the students at BYU. There are many students who are probably scared to say how they feel about this for fear they'll be thrown out of school for speaking out against university regulations. Hopefully they have the option to take the classes they need to from home if they don't want to do this.

Imagine being forced to be tested once a week to keep your job. Imagine being forced to be tested once a week or you're forced to move out of your community.

That's what these students are facing. How can the governor feel justified in this kind of discrimination?
How can he feel justified in creating this gross violation of rights?

Nobody should be forced to have tests done on their body if they don't want them done. Why are college students the ones being targeted by this kind of requirement? There are many other groups of people that could be contributing to the spread. This isn't right.",How thankful I am I am not a student. This is horrible,Great investment!!,With all this being said::: BYU needs to go üíØ online through January or longer if numbers keep rising. Most state schools are and you should follow suit.,I have 2 kids at BYU and they don‚Äôt know anyone who is sick. This mandatory testing is ridiculous. And then forced to isolate if positive even if no symptoms. I don‚Äôt trust the accuracy of the test. Sad they have to go through this. Feel like it‚Äôs just to drive up case numbers so then more govt control.,"The healthier you are::: the better your body will fight infection and disease. Boost your body‚Äôs immunity by carefully following the Lord‚Äôs Law of Health in Doctrine and Covenants 89. The promises are amazing...

‚ÄúAnd all saints who remember to keep and do these sayings::: walking in obedience to the commandments::: shall receive health in their navel and marrow to their bones; And shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge::: even hidden treasures; And shall run and not be weary::: and shall walk and not faint. And I::: the Lord::: give unto them a promise::: that the destroying angel shall pass by them::: as the children of Israel::: and not slay them.‚Äù

The best way to avoid sickness and disease is to build your defenses!

tulGQmzkAIo",Thank you BYU!,"I have been stunned at the stubbornness and short-sightedne
ss in UT during the last few months. It's frankly alarming to me to see so many people who view emergency public health measures as equivalent to a communist takeover. When will you realize that these measures are about keeping vulnerable people safe? When will it start sinking in that this is not all about YOU::: but about all of us? Arizona has already had more than 6:::300 people die from this virus...how many deaths will it take for you to start taking this seriously? Just wear a mask.","From Yale Epidemiologist:::
Jonathan Smith: An important Covid Message

""As an infectious disease epidemiologist:::
at this point I feel morally obligated to provide some information on what we are seeing from a transmission dynamic perspective and how they apply to the social distancing measures.

Like any good scientist I have noticed two things that are either not being articulated or not present in the ‚Äúliterature‚Äù of social media.
I have also relied on my much smarter infectious disease epidemiologist friends for peer review of this post; any edits are from that peer review.

""Specifically::: I want to make two aspects of these measures very clear and unambiguous.

""First::: we are in the beginning of this epidemic‚Äôs trajectory. That means even with these distancing measures we will see cases and deaths continue to rise globally::: nationally::: and in our own communities in the coming weeks.

This may lead some people to think that the social distancing measures are not working. They are. They may feel futile. They aren‚Äôt. You will feel discouraged. You should. This is normal in chaos.

But this is normal epidemic trajectory. Stay calm. This enemy that we are facing is very good at what it does; we are not failing. We need everyone to hold the line as the epidemic inevitably gets worse.

""This is not my opinion; this is the unforgiving math of epidemics for which I and my colleagues have dedicated our lives to understanding with great nuance::: and this disease is no exception.

I want to help the community brace for this impact. Stay strong and with solidarity knowing with absolute certainty that what you are doing is saving lives::: even as people begin getting sick and dying. You may feel like giving in.

Don‚Äôt.

""Second::: although social distancing measures have been (at least temporarily) well-received::: there is an obvious-but-ove
rlooked phenomenon when considering groups (i.e. families) in transmission dynamics.

While social distancing decreases contact with members of society::: it typically increases your contacts with family members /very close friends.

This small and obvious fact has surprisingly profound implications on disease transmission dynamics.

Study after study demonstrates that even if there is only a little bit of connection between groups (i.e. social dinners::: playdates/
playgrounds::: etc.)::: the epidemic isn‚Äôt much different than if there was no measure in place.

The same underlying fundamentals of disease transmission apply::: and the result is that the community is left with all of the social and economic disruption but very little public health benefit.

""You should perceive your entire family to function as a single individual unit; if one person puts themselves at risk::: everyone in the unit is at risk. Seemingly small social chains get large and complex with alarming geometric speed.

If your son visits his girlfriend::: and you later sneak over for coffee with a neighbor::: your neighbor is now connected to the infected office worker that your son‚Äôs girlfriend‚Äôs mother shook hands with. This sounds silly::: it‚Äôs not. This is not a joke or a hypothetical.

We as epidemiologists
see it borne out in the data time and time again and no one listens. Conversely::: any break in that chain breaks disease transmission along that whole chain.

""In contrast to hand-washing and other personal measures::: social distancing measures are not about individuals::: they are about societies working in unison.
These measures also take a long time to see the results. It is hard (even for me) to conceptualize how on a population level::: ‚Äòone quick little get together‚Äô can undermine the entire framework of a public health intervention::: but it does.

I promise you it does. I promise. I promise. I promise.

""You can‚Äôt cheat it. People are already itching to cheat on the social distancing precautions just a ‚Äúlittle‚Äù- a playdate::: a haircut::: or picking up a needless item at the store::: etc.

From a transmission dynamics standpoint::: this very quickly recreates a highly connected social network that undermines all of the work the community has done so far.

""Until we get a viable vaccine this unprecedented outbreak will not be overcome in one grand::: sweeping gesture::: rather only by the collection of individual choices our community makes in the coming months.

This virus is unforgiving to choices outside the rules.

""My goal in writing this is to prevent communities from getting ‚Äòsucker-punched
‚Äô by what the epidemiological
community knows will happen in the coming weeks.

It will be easy to be drawn to the idea that what we are doing isn‚Äôt working and become paralyzed by fear::: or to just 'cheat‚Äô a little bit in the coming weeks.

By knowing what to expect::: and knowing the importance of maintaining these measures ::: my hope is to encourage continued community spirit::: strategizing::: and action to persevere in this time of uncertainty.""

Veterans Day is for all who served",Thanks all of them for their service.,Thank you all for your Service .‚ù§Ô∏èüôèüá∫üá∏,Wow::: that's awesome,"If I may::: last year I was visiting campus and someone::: whom I believe was a faculty member::: was hosting a conference call in your Memorial room at the Wilkinson Center. I patiently waited for her to end her video call and I kindly asked her to keep reverence in the room. Of course::: she was apologetic::: but I was wondering if there's anything we can do to maintain the reverence of your Memorial room?

For those who want to comment to help me distinguish the difference between Veterans Day and Memorial Day::: I assure you I know the difference. But I thought I'd take this opportunity to comment given the nature of this post.",God bless you brothers and sisters!ü§∫ü§∫ü§∫‚ù§Ô∏èüôè‚ù§Ô∏èü§∫ü§∫ü§∫,Gerson Rodriguez,God bless all current and previous soldiers!,Wade Ardern,I love America üá∫üá∏,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hung onto the ball too long::: took a fair share of sacks::: and his deep ball was way off all night::: but his receivers bailed him out. Also set the receivers up to be plastered.

However::: this is just another win. Not the big marquee win as Boise State was playing with inexperienced 4th and 5th string freshman. Plus::: the D/ST got roasted by Shakir 3 times in a row. Boise State also without star RB and most dynamic player on D.

Better hope people just see the score and didn‚Äôt follow the game.",I was cheering you guys on the whole game::: and scaring my three little ones in the process. ü§£It was so worth it! GO COUGS! üíôü§çüíô,"Not only is BYU winning::: but winning BIG! Congratulations

Just manhandled them.,I hope we can schedule some more games so we don't have any bye weeks::: we have a really good chance at the playoff if we keep playing like this. A few weeks off will hurt us.,The Smurf Blue Turf Jinx is No More !

‚ÄúToday at Brigham Young University I shared a message about important issues of our day::: including overcoming racism. Personal attitudes and official practices of racism are not consistent with the revealed word of God. We know that God created all mortals and we are all children of God. The challenge of racism is not a new one::: but recent events have precipitated the current discussion.

‚ÄúThe shocking police-produced death of George Floyd in Minnesota last May was surely a trigger for nationwide protests in the United States::: whose momentum was carried forward under the message of ‚ÄòBlack Lives Matter.‚Äô Of course Black lives matter! That is an eternal truth all reasonable people should support.

‚ÄúDear friends::: let us all heed President Russell M. Nelson's call to repent::: to change::: and to improve. Only the gospel of Jesus Christ can unite and bring peace to people of all races and nationalities. We who believe in that gospel‚Äîwhatever our origins‚Äîmust unite in love of each other and of our Savior::: Jesus Christ.‚Äù ‚ÄîPresident Dallin H. Oaks

Artwork: used with permission from the artist Amber Eldredge",10/28/2020 2:14,To Heavenly Father and hopefully to all of us... every life matters.,I don‚Äôt like that Oaks commented on the Floyd death when there is no verdict yet and it may very likely be not police brutality at all! This goes against everything were taught about obeying laws of the land which states innocent until proven guilty! Also what is alarming is to hear him assume racism is a big problem right now when it statistically is not! When the church denied blacks priesthood there was racism but he didn‚Äôt remind us of the church‚Äôs mistakes with this in the past which was far more harmful! He also must not realize that mask wearing is a state issue and not a federal mandate! My state does not require masks::: yet the church has not respected my states law that allows mask wearing at church! The church has asked all states abide by the church mandate::: infringing on individual states rights! Sadly::: Oaks is out of touch and living in a bubble!,Today while I was in the check out line at Target::: there was a little black girl in front of me. She was so cute and precious! She made my day! There is beauty all around us::: if we just stop::: look and listen.,"In my ward::: I am the Relief Society president. For me and members of my diverse ward::: the BLM movement has been about asking tough questions about who gets heard::: about who is made uncomfortable or made to feel other when they come to church or activities::: about who gets callings. It has led to productive conversations and real steps forward. Our stake president has been asking the tough questions as well. We are learning to ask and listen. The civil rights movement took us some distance::: but there is progress to be made.

The BLM movement is about creating that change from wherever we are. I believe that we all need to do that work. I think of the scripture::: ""Wo be unto him that is at ease in Zion. Wo be unto him that crieth: All is well."" If we want to be like Jesus::: we have some soul searching to do. By looking for things we disagree with in the BLM movement::: we can miss the point-\-\sort of looking for the mote in someone else's eye when we have a beam in ours. Concerning ourselves only with rioting destruction::: is misguided. That destruction::: I believe::: can grow out of a sense of powerlessness and rage that comes from not being heard. I want to be one of the listeners. Destruction needs to stop::: but I'm not going to be the one tasked with tending to that. Consequently::: I don't want it to stop me from from paying attention to the things I can actually do something about.","If the title is so misleading why does President Oaks have it on his personal page. How dumb are people in the first place::: that they think that everyone who says::: ‚ÄúBlack Lives Matter‚Äù are ONLY those who align with the organization that bears the same name? Why is it so darn hard to understand that we are referring to the sentiment and not an organization???
? Why does this ALWAYS need to be clarified??? Why? Because people with racism and racial bias can‚Äôt get with it. Point. Blank. Periodt.","You have to read the whole article to really understand that he is not endorsing blm. He is reminding us that the only way to really come together is to come closer to Christ. As His representative:::
he will always teach that.",Comment threads are such a revealing gauge of what people want to hear and what they've chosen to retain. Taking a close listen to President Oaks' remarks takes us away from the fringes and reactionary mindsets in which many of us have taken refuge::: and allows us to see that the 'sides' of our man-made culture war offer little of worth in the face of what the gospel of Jesus Christ offers us and instructs us to create - unity::: community::: equality::: family. Zion. He and others offered this counsel at our October General Conference. It's so disheartening to see to what lengths we will go to reject the words of our prophets. On the other hand::: having the dialogue::: challenging ourselves and each other to work past the ideas we have previously held is part of the process of conversion. Here's to those who are willing to take those steps.,is byu open or anyone know when it's opening back up again?,I don‚Äôt know why we are pretending that we are all racist. I‚Äôm tired of playing this divisive game::: and so should administrators at BYU. This is what creates racism in a previously post racial society.,Police produced::: or drug overdose?? We simply don't know yet. Maybe both.,"We all need to be very conscious of race relations and while we do need to look out for bad attitudes about minorities::: they need to stop the white shaming and blaming and insistance on the perjorative use of ""whiteness."" Love folks of all shades and colors and hope for the same in return.",With you on everything but George Floyd who died by proof of the coroners report withheld for some reason until later that proved he died of a self inflicted overdose of two drugs.,"I see that ""even the very elect shall be deceived""!",So we are at church point in history when we have to be told that racism is bad? Are we spiritually stupid? Anyone who has been taught anything about the Savior knows that treating some else wrongly for any reason is bad and therefore racism is wrong. When has that ever been in question? It is only in question now because of BLM outbursts::: which comes up ironically around election cycles. I wish the church leaders would address issues based off of our spiritual needs::: not based off of the demands of terrorist groups like BLM.,Black lives matter is a semantically overloaded statement. That semantic overload is 100% intentional. The BLM organization uses this inarguably true statement in order to drive semantic confusion and inevitable discord (as is evidenced within these comments). Elder Oaks is clearly referring to the statement::: and not the organization.,"What was the message BLM carried anti-police anti-religion anti-government
and hate for all the people they killed the church should not even mention them it‚Äôs embarrassing",This is obviously a political statement::: please don‚Äôt talk in the name of God or the Church. For God all lives matter::: asian ::: white::: black::: Latinos like me::: etc.,"First::: this post is misleading.....
.Pres Oaks never indicated a support for the movement of BLM...the organization is a blatant racist organization that is ant-Christian..
......Second::: racism is found in all races...affirma
tive action::: black only scholarships::: companies that hire a mandatory number of minorities::: all these things that our society deems as ""normal"" are all racist programs that promote one race over whites.....the only way to do away with racism is to quit treating people differently because of race.....no one should get preference over another::: it should all be merit based.",Most of us are guilty of selective obedience::: especially me.,"BLM is a socialist/
communist organization that wants to dismantle the family üò≥üò≥",Whatever President Oaks intended::: these comments would aggrieve him. Is anyone echoing his message of relying on Christ? Christ calls for compassion::: and for loving our enemies-\-\even our political enemies. That's not what I'm reading in these comments. Let's be one in Christ because we certainly can't be one otherwise.,Do not construe that BLM is in anyway endorsed by The church if Jesus Christ of latter day saints.. the doctrine that all are alike unto God is true and is being addressed::: which is much different than supporting a violent self described Marxist organization of which one founder declared the traditional family a threat and has voiced destain for men marriage and parenthood particularly that fathers are not needed and females should not be encumbered with children but available to march and riot as directed for social justice... doctrine of all alike is eternal and true .. BLM is not,I‚Äôm so grateful for an apostle of God who has spoken out against racism in very clear terms. We would all do well to actually study and contemplate his words and begin the tough::: messy work of trying to create positive change that will come as we listen to our Black sisters and brothers.,üôÑDon‚Äôt hate! Don‚Äôt murder!( Adults or babies). Dont lie! Don‚Äôt condone violence! These are all things we‚Äôve been taught as important principles. Do not politicize what the prophet says. It‚Äôs a great. Reminder::: but nothing that as Christians we shouldn‚Äôt already know. In regards to our moral compass::: It doesn‚Äôt matter who is elected::: all the issues we are facing will only change as Americans search for kindness and goodness. Conodoning violent protests (no matter the reason) is not leading us in the right direction. üôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑ,I thought of positive comments for this quote coming from the apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ... But it seems that ideas are coming from different directions.. i think i need to apply the statement to myself because i myself admit that i am a judgmental person and needing to repent... thank you whoever post this statement because we need this to improve ourselves and to be what the Savior wants us to be...,I think you can beleive the church:::want police reform:::and not want racism while not supporting black lives matter.,"Horribly written summary of the speach. It gives the impression that President Oaks came out in support of the BLM movement. Couldn‚Äôt be more different than what he said when taken as a whole. I encourage everyone to read the full text.

Many believe it has done just that.,Floyd would not have died from the police‚Äôs actions if he did not have 4x the lethal limit of Fentanyl in his system. I know it‚Äôs hard to admit that a black person is responsible for their own actions and that all black hardships are not caused by white police.,I love what he said about wearing a mask!,Thank you BYU and sharing President Oaks‚Äô words today.,A lot of people here with the incorrect assumption that the church will always stand in the same corner as American conservatism. Sad that your loyalty to a political side is more important than your commitment to following guidance from our prophets and apostles.,Jadzia Padilla imagine thinking BLM is a political statement and still refusing to accept the movement even when an apostle of God tells people that it's an eternal principal that should be lived.,All correct and when I stated this l got unfriended. No loss but there‚Äôs too many people that have their heads in the sand,Q Anon is rampant here......,I went to BYU. I read this article to find empathy::: compassion. However::: lots of comments here full of hatred. Judge not least you be judged.,Amazing to see people believe their dictator rather than general authorities.,It is ridiculous that church's university posted about politics and supporting on this a post a one candidate..,Blm eternal truth? Lol.,Wow. I hope didnt learn that at the Y,There is a difference between black lives matter and Black Lives Matter. One is clearly something we embrace. We are all children of God. The other is a Marxist movement that wants to destroy our form of government::: Western culture and the traditional family.,Black lives matter It is a criminal organization. Supported by Genocide George Soros.,So the person who put this article togeather did a very poor job woth the quotes. Elder Oaks never said George Floyd's deather was police produced. That was commentary by the writting and was not a quote. Be sure to pay attention to what is a quote and what is not. So i went back and reread the actual devotional and he did say that. I will say he is of a sound mind. And is not one to promote crazy lawlessness. And that he is human and allowed to make flaws.,Shame on you::: BYU for assuming someone acted with racist intent with zero evidence to back up that claim. Really sick of your PR team lately.,George Floyd‚Äôs death was not produced by the police it was a fentanyl overdose. Black lives matter is a Marxist communist group whose stated goals if you‚Äôd care to look them up are totally antithetical to the gospel and they have done nothing to help or benefit the lives of out brothers and sisters::: who just happen to have black skin. Stop promoting propaganda. Racism is and always has been evil and has always been used and promoted by the self-righteous.,Not true Douglas.,Im getting really sick of this. Im sure there is racism. White to black black to white and everyother race but it is not systematic and every white person is not rasist and every black person innocent,That art is awesome,I heard you exclude white people from your multicultural center is that true? If it is true is that racism? Would Jesus approve?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is an unprecedented season with so many unpredictables.
..BYU would take the best competition they could if the schedule allowed. They had a gauntlet of a schedule before this happened and though they might not be sitting at 6-0 and #12-#10 in the country::: nothing boosts confidence::: refines talent and fortifies a program more than winning football and winning BIG at that! These coaches and kids start believing they can beat anybody and they just might see it through!

"A shortage of N95 masks worldwide has led to important developments on campus with the Nanos Foundation. Undergraduate students from BYU's Sensors and Applied Biomechanics Engineering Laboratories helped develop a way to turn a regular cloth mask into an N95 mask.

Using a process called electrospinning::: student researchers create membranes comprised of trillions of nanofibers that trap particles‚Äîincluding viruses. These nanofiber membranes within a regular cloth mask provide the same filtration as an N95 mask.",10/20/2020 15:29,"""When Should a Mask Be Used?

Face masks should be used only by individuals who have symptoms of a respiratory infection such as coughing::: sneezing::: or::: in some cases::: fever. Face masks should also be worn by health care workers::: by individuals who are taking care of or are in close contact with people who have respiratory infections::: or otherwise as directed by a doctor. Face masks should not be worn by healthy individuals to protect themselves from acquiring respiratory infection because there is no evidence to suggest that face masks worn by healthy individuals are effective in preventing people from becoming ill.""

"Catastrophic fires in the West are burning hotter than ever::: leaving paths of destruction through both human development and native plant ecosystems.

Using seed enhancement technology never before used in rangeland restoration::: BYU professor of plant and wildlife sciences Matt Madsen and his students are leading an effort to reseed fire-scorched landscapes across the Great Basin with native plants. This technology includes seed coatings traditionally used in commercial farming (for food products) and other treatments that are specifically formulated for rangeland seeds.

How it works and which coating is used depends on the seed::: but the goal is always the same: help the seeds get distributed evenly into the soil and give them the best chance for survival.

"In response to recent COVID-19 trends in our county::: the following joint letter was sent this morning to all BYU and UVU students from President Worthen and President Tuminez:

Dear Students:::

As the presidents of the two largest universities in the state of Utah::: we are grateful that we have been able to open our student facilities and offer face-to-face classes this fall semester. We thank those who have been compliant with the safety guidelines that have been put in place due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

However::: we are greatly concerned about the dramatic rise in positive cases of COVID-19 in Utah County::: particularly among college students. This is both alarming and unacceptable.

We‚Äôre concerned not only for your well-being::: but also those in the local community who are affected by the trends we‚Äôve seen in the last week.

Behavior must change. We implore you to stay home except for in-person classes::: work::: church::: and other essentials. We ask that you limit your social interactions to only those within your household and avoid small gatherings where individuals aren‚Äôt wearing masks or maintaining physical distance. If you‚Äôre feeling sick::: stay home. If you've had a known exposure to the virus::: may test positive for the virus or are awaiting a test result::: follow the quarantine guidelines of state and local health officials. We expect you to follow all safety requirements on campus and all state and local mandates off campus.

If circumstances do not improve within the next two weeks::: more dramatic action will be necessary. This may include a two-week quarantine::: closing campuses to the public or a complete retreat to all-remote instruction for the rest of the semester.

Please be wise. Your individual choices will make all the difference.

Sincerely:::

Kevin J Worthen::: BYU President
Astrid S. Tuminez::: UVU President",9/22/2020 16:53,Faith over fear! What happened to living by gospel principles? BYU has sold out long ago. Yuck.,I'm surprised at how many people get all ruffled by something as simple as this. They're just asking the students to help out in this situation. Wearing masks and social distancing isn't that hard. None of us like it but it's the charitable thing to do right now. They are the main tools we have to fight this and help us get back to normal::: which we all want! So maybe try to set your grievances aside and do what's best for the common good!,"I am shocked at this statement. It is so condemning and full of blame. Germs are not going away. Colds are not going away. This statement blames college students for coughs and colds. There has been and will be coughs and colds and sickness and death. Staying home for part of the day or putting on a mask will not stop colds not viruses from affecting humans. This year nor next year nor the next year::: bacteria and viruses will still affect humans by causing sickness especially to weakened immune systems. Telling the young people to get more sleep::: eat more fruits and vegetables::: drink more water::: and to eat much less junk food would have a better affect on their health than telling them to isolate themselves and create more loneliness and fear.

Please please don‚Äôt blame the students for coughs and colds and fall viruses. Let‚Äôs support them in healthy socializing and normal social living. No blame only truth in science and in health.",Thank you::: BYU! This is so important. I‚Äôve been really impressed by how campus has mitigated the spread so hopefully we students can do our part!,Such a rude::: demeaning::: power hungry letter. Too bad leaders like these have such need to stroke their egos to fulfill their need to feel all powerful.,I love how the president of BYU and UVU came together and posted this announcement as a team ü•∞,Keep it in perspective. What are the risks to these healthy young people. UNLOCK THE STATE AND HER PEOPLE. LET FREEDOM RING.,Thank you::: BYU for taking this seriously. I can‚Äôt imagine my freshman year with out all the random socializing and huge get togethers::: but this is the reality of 2020. It‚Äôs so disappointing and embarrassing to see members of our alumni::: most from my own church::: disregard science and the lives of other people.,"""We ask that you limit your social interactions to only those within your household and avoid small gatherings where individuals aren‚Äôt wearing masks or maintaining physical distance."" This doesn't resonate with college students. Provide alternative activities.",All the self-appointed FB doctors to the rescue!! Some of these responses are so alarming. I‚Äôm *really* hoping most of them aren‚Äôt current BYU students or alum but just disgruntled U of U fans trolling the BYU Facebook page. üòÇ,It has never been a practice to quarantine the healthy. Those high risk should quarantine themselves. Let the rest of humanity get on with our lives and businesses and school and back to normal! The mental::: emotional::: and financial cost of this insane lockdown has far outweighed the risks. The six month anniversary of the two week flatten the curve has gone long enough. We flattened the curve! This isn't gonna go away. We are all going to get it eventually. In the meantime::: let's be more concerned about the businesses that have and will cease to exist. The travel industry::: the hotel industry::: the bowling alleys::: the hair salons::: the corn mazes! Enough is enough! I'm disgusted that my Alma Mater is shaming their students including one of my own. Shame on BYU for bending to the pressure and ignoring the actual Utah data. (i.e.::: 92% of deaths are high risk::: 73 is the average age of death::: over 72% who died are over 65 yrs old).,Does everyone realize that the current campus case count is 400 active which is 0.93% of the campus community? The total reported INCLUDING those who have recover is 927 which is only 2.2% of the campus community. So please explain to me why are we causing everyone to freak out?,Provo and Orem is going from yellow stage of recovery back to orange starting Wednesday. Follow the rules and we will go back to yellow. Masks are also mandatory starting Wednesday.,A rise in cases... but not a rise in DEATHS. This has become a common cold. The common cold is a coronovirus::: so if you get a free test that they are handing out like candy (hence a ‚Äúrise‚Äù in cases)::: then you will test positive for ‚ÄúCovid‚Äù even if you don‚Äôt have it. This is the first health crisis to cause fear and shut down our economy based off of CASES and not DEATHS. Let people live their lives. If you are afraid or high risk::: then stay home::: but the rest of us would like to get back to the REAL normal.,If BYU goes totally remote::: my husband won't be able to finish his incredibly important video projects. Getting a job in the advertising industry is highly determined by your portfolio. Moving all studies online won't allow him to finish up the projects planned for this year. So::: PLEASE PLEASE wear a mask!,I can see how a young student can have the mindset that since it won't affect them it is all a big over-reaction. It's hard to see how it can affect other people. Glad BYU and UVU are on the same page about this and are trying very hard to stay open for in person classes but are being so careful about it. You can still have fun at college while following these guidelines.,"The goal is to reduce the curve::: correct? Not to necessarily prevent everyone to exposure. Are these cases leading to hospitalization
s? Tell us the all the facts not just positive results. Positive results without hospitalization
s could be a good thing as we get closer to herd immunity. Don‚Äôt just play the scare game- give us the facts. We already have one Fauci::: we don‚Äôt need another...",Lollll how do you expect students to follow the rules when members of the administration don‚Äôt???,I love BYU. But have we ever been ‚Äúgreatly concerned‚Äù about a rise in flu cases in years where the flu was going around? I doubt it. The students are more at risk of danger crossing the street on 9th East with crazy drivers or sledding at an FHE activity than they are from the Covid flu.,Based on the comments here from students::: it seems both BYU and UVU are failing in educating their students with a proper understanding of basic biology::: statistics::: and the difference between legitimate sources of information and biased media.,"Please make this the last chance. We in the community don‚Äôt want to continue to suffer for the students selfishness or the administration‚Äô
s inability to hold them accountable/
take necessary action in the face of their recklessness.",Thank you for the warning and the reminder. I have kids that attend both schools and have been surprised to hear of the gatherings taking place around them::: especially after they signed and agreed to compliance with social distancing standards. I'm concerned for them and others as this virus once again takes a strong hold.,Wow!! I love how they are unified together!,Data and information. What is the percentage of false positives? Can any of you give me that statistic? Have the ‚Äòexperts‚Äô given us that piece of information? Why the shift to positive cases now? How many of those students are asymptomatic? How many are in the hospital? How many deaths? Why shut down everything because of cases? Weren‚Äôt masks supposed to stop the virus? Well::: if they are being negligent::: the people wearing them should be ok::: no? How many people younger than 25 have died from -not with- Covid? As of September 16th in all of the US::: 333 people between 15-24 had died WITH covid. 64 more from 0 to 14. Is this response commensurate to the risk? Just asking questions::: feel free to answer them for me::: but spare me your personal opinions and attacks::: just looking for data backed answers::: is all::: and wondering why so many people don‚Äôt ask more questions!,99.6% survival rate. Let‚Äôs move on already,I don't care about the number of cases. How many deaths have their been?! Are we going to cancel and shut down school for the flu too? I don't know...I think this is extreme for a virus with a 99.7% survival rate.,"Blaming students is a fast way to shirk administrative responsibility.
The tone in this letter should have been from the beginning rather than passive aggressive messaging. Of course the students rebelled.",What exactly is the End game? The virus is not going to disappear and this political BS is not going to change that. When will it be over? The sooner everyone gets it and gets over it the better...,Uh::: just drive by the creamery literally any night and you'll see the root of the problem.,Parhetic. It‚Äôs a casedemic at this point.,Less geddit people.. I‚Äôm here for the comments,Let them stay::: they'll get over it and be better for it.,You cannot demand people behave a certain way outside the school grounds. You are not dictators.,Yeah let's let depression and mental illness kill them instead. Much better that way.,#maskup Provo! Get it together!!,"I want to believe these choices are founded. It would be helpful to judge from all the data.

Leaders need to be transparent with the factors used. Deaths::: numbers of new tests and reasons for increases. Changes in ratios between tests::: cases and deaths.

If this is not fear mongering::: and if we are to begin trusting each other and having strong societal integrity::: this is necessary.

Americans are all meant to be experts delegating powers to leaders. Leaders need to trust constituents with factors of decisions.",Oh no! A whole bunch of positives from a useless test::: where no one had symptoms and no one got sick! Shut it down! The sky is falling! üò±,"I‚Äôm so sick of the whole propaganda::: fear-mongering:::
shut-down society as we know it mentality! And I‚Äôm disappointed:::to
say the least::: that my Alma Mater (and my husband‚Äôs) have hopped on board this crazy train. Yes::: people have died. And people die for the flu and from drunk-driving and all sorts of horrible::: sad situations. But we do not shut down our country for those issues::: which are just as real and sad. Now::: we have resulted to SHAMING students for wanting to live life (the audacity). Enough is enough!!","""Any public health plan that requires radical changes in behavior and perfect compliance is doomed to fail...If school administrators could put themselves back in their 18-year-old selves for just a minute::: it would become clear to them that what they're asking from a college student is unrealistic...B
ut I think there's been a lack of empathy in what's happening on campuses."" https://

So not happy with my Alum University.",Thank you to all the students who decided to be negligent and continue to host and go to parties and have large gatherings of more than 20 people. We love how selfish you are all being,This is exactly the stuff we need right now. Thankyou,Thank you üôèüèª,Thank you for saying something.,It‚Äôs a little late for this warning. Too many careless students have infected an entire campus causing some students to miss out on lab classes that cannot be done virtually.,How about before you tell all of us students how unacceptable you are::: you realize that your ‚Äúmask standards‚Äù are ineffective in the first place. Most masks people are wearing on campus are not effective at blocking COVID from others::: so maybe if you educated us on which masks were actually effective::: or even if you supplied them to the student body::: then you would see the results you want. I mean you could at least try doing something::: other than hanging cheesy posters all over school::: before you come at us and tell us how awful we are.,Tuition should be lowered::: because these college students are getting an extremely limited::: lower quality experience!,Time to pull up your pants and act like adults::: otherwise we will have to put the diaper on.,Would be cool if maybe also BYU took their honor code as seriously with students not following Covid precautions thus breaking the honor code::: as they do with lgbtq students.,"This just in: Facebook is a dumpster fire where everyone comes to yell at each other::: dehumanize::: and claim they are an expert on some particular topic or opinion because of something else they read that rings personally true...

but boy can it be entertaining to watch a big dumpster fire!",Just remember everyone that this virus is so dangerous that mayors in this country literally had to cover up their numbers because the spread was so small and didn‚Äôt justify their actions...,"In other words we still want your money and we still want you to go into massive amounts of debt so that we can pad our pockets but we don't want you to socialize or have anything close to a normal life or to progress with your personal life in any meaningful way with things like human connection::: friendships::: or heaven forbid::: romantic relationships.
There's a reason college kids go to brick and mortar schools. It's so they can meet and be with other people their own age. If it wasn't for that motivation everyone would be doing online school. It's more convenient and often cheaper. This letter is essentially taking away the sole reason people still go to these physical schools.

Honestly students shouldn't have to tolerate being threatened after paying so much money. which is basically what the last paragraph is doing.
Why don't the schools just. Do the honest thing and refund the students and cancel the school year.",Good ever loving grief. ü§¶,So did the Workdwide Fast not work? It did work if you look at the numbers and the mortality rates! We were blessed but the media won‚Äôt let us all enjoy it. Will they ever let us enjoy peace again? Will normalcy be enjoyed anytime soon?,I am proud of my granddaughter who is happy to respect others by complying to covid protocols. She is at BYU to get a degree and share life with those of similar standards. Life is not about entitlement. Love others with empathy. Grateful for our leaders who take safety seriously.,"A young man I know was trying to set up a socially-distan
ced date with a girl from a dating app::: and the girl literally said to him (in the dating app)::: ""Oh::: by the way::: I have Covid but I'm on like day 8 of my quarantine so it's chill""... They did not go on the date. Totally support BYU and UVU pushing all students to take precautions more seriously!",So many sheep::: ok with putting masks on and shutting their lives down ü§£,Update: My daughter at BYU was exposed to Covid. She has tried for three days to be tested but the testing center tells her she can't afford it. What??? She has great insurance that will cover it::: and if not::: I will cover the cost::: so I don't understand why students who have symptoms and have been exposed are not able to have testing done. I have put a call into the state health office::: but honestly::: this frustrates me. I have also had friends post about their kids who are in the quarantined dorms unable to get food::: even those on food plans. ? I think BYU needs to form a plan and stick with a good one. First and foremost::: open testing to students (free in the state of Utah) so those testing positive willl stop spreading it to others. Maddening.,Those who are at risk should be free to stay home until the pandemic has passed. (Hint: Current stats suggest this has already happened.) Holding young people responsible for the mortality of their grandparents is cruel::: cowardly and scientifically indefensible.,Thank you! Students need to consider the consequences of their choices on the greater community. They can greatly impact the spread of COVID-19 in the community benefiting their vulnerable neighbors. I fully support BYU taking disciplinary action against individual students disregarding guidelines::: as well as implementing wider campus restrictions.,Honestly::: I‚Äôm surprised that BYU is reacting like this when there are a little over 12:::000 active cases total in the ENTIRE state,Why is the campus still open?... BYU is actually doing its job: Furthering the Kingdom of God...by helping to add more souls on the other side of the veil üòî,I am so disappointed in BYU. Your mandate for the communist APP is wrong. I refuse to allow my BYU student to use my phone for this anti-freedom APP. I also am so disappointed in the random COVID testing and Mask mandates. Reporting a POSITIVE for the radom testing if you dont show up for this forced test is WRONG. Herd immunity must happen and the only way that will happen is if we allow this virus to run its course. We have over 3:::000 viruses and BYU students are not in the age range for death. Stop acting like a communist organization.,Bless your hearts BYU & UVU. You think you‚Äôre going to continue pressuring people to quarantine using your relationship with government. You‚Äôre also implying the use of force on the citizens. We reject your message::: we do not consent::: and as members of the Church we‚Äôll pray for you to repent and change your ways.,Has my generation been responsible for raising a generation of irresponsible young people? The sins of the fathers and mothers.etc. etc. The lessons of consequences will be learned. Hope it is sooner rather than later.,Like dating and finding a spouse is not a priority any more??? Not if you might get sick for a week?!,I wish the group of students going to large parties on the weekends were not so greatly effecting the lives of all the other students who just want to go to class,Doesn‚Äôt anyone understand that the brethren have to uphold and sustain the laws of the land. That is all they are doing here. This will change when the law does.,When you bring a large amount of people back to the Provo/Orem area::: the chance cases are going to rise is going to increase. People should still follow guidelines and wear masks::: but I think it‚Äôs only natural when you have a large arrival of people returning to the area.,One thing I don‚Äôt understand why punishing citizens of Utah County based on college students being selfish and negligent on their part. If they live in or out of state then send them back to their parents home to quarantine.,"After a while::: we need to think of the STUDENTS needs. ""Think of others:::"" we say. Meanwhile their quality of education and joy of life in this critical stage is being sacrificed. My BA could have been earned online::: had that been available back then::: but what about the sciences::: engineering::: nursing? Covid is not going away. Even if they develop a vaccine there are enough antivaxxers to diminish its effectiveness. Are those that will refuse the vaccine thinking of others? Hardly. So I repeat: Covid is not going away.","I am interested to see how many of the current positive tests actually have PCR settings that are too high-\-\resulting
in positive tests when there is actually no active or viable virus present. How many of those testing positive now are actually sick?",We all need to stop being afraid of the virus and get on with life. Less tests need to happen as I believe the test isn‚Äôt even that accurate and please just use a mask. By social distancing and using a mask::: WE ALL can start returning to a normal life. Stop being afraid guys! I‚Äôm not happy BYU üò§ this is absurd.,Church! Lol 100 plus people! Essential!,"I don't think students paid your stupid tuition prices to get a horrible education online. If you take ""more serious action"" how about you refund the students their money?",And for all that is good and holy::: don‚Äôt allow yourself to contract a virus that most likely you‚Äôll never know about because your immune system killed it. Don‚Äôt become one of THOSE people who develop an immunity to the virus negating the need for a vaccine.,"We need more info to know. 10 cases per 100 or 10:::000. Is that higher or lower than auto deaths? More or less deadly than peanut allergies? Better or worse then high blood pressure?

These numbers alone tell us nothing. We have nothing to compare to. I know the risks of driving a car and accept those risks everyday. WHY are they hiding enough info to compare and understand.

Also::: why are they using ""contracted"" the disease. Right now tons of people are ""contracting"" the flu and cold viruses. They do not report those on a daily basis? IF they did we could compare them to Covid::: we could know.",We lost a student to the virus at UVU when this all started::: he was 27. There are elderly and those at high risk that live in Provo and Orem year round. We as students need to start taking this seriously before we harm the local population and businesses with what may come.,"""Alarming and unacceptible"" for sure::: but certainly not surprising. Right? I don't like to say this::: but I think the BYU administration was ""alarmingly"" negligent in being so open and non-chalant about students returning to campus. I'm also amazed at this negiligence::: given the close connection to the CJCLDS::: which has been very responsible and concerned when dealing with the C-19 pandemic. What/Who went wrong on this?",I‚Äôm a gonna blame the UVU students. Surely the zoobees would not be so dumb to think wearing masks is a violation of their liberty. Don‚Äôt be dumb kids!,Just tell then to stay away from old people. The sooner young people get over it::: the sooner everyone else will be safe. I don't know how people can still be stuck on this whole no transmission ideal when it's clearly impossible.,Do they really expect freshmen who are living in 5 by 10 sardine cans with a roommate to be listening to this at all?,Oh::: brother...the game is rigged. How many more tests are being given? Is the death rate going up? Are hospitals overloaded? What is the positive threshold of the labs? Are they uniform? How about we protect the vulnerable and allow this virus to run its course? Seems a lot more logical than shutting down our country.,Has any college student died or even been seriously I'll from Covid-19?,I support this statement and argue that the students need to do better in combating the spread of Covid-19. This is a serious issue that needs to be dealt with!,I am very concerned by the delayed response of BYU in handling COVID-19 as they‚Äôve reopened for fall. There are many other colleges that have shown a better response to support students who become ill::: contact tracing::: etc. Require compliance with masks and social distancing rather than just suggesting it. This is some progress but it almost feels like too little too late BYU. üò¨,"It is sadly apparent from many of the responses to this post::: widespread misunderstandin
g and ignorance continue to abound. No wonder the numbers continue to rise. Proud of the universities for being proactive and protective of the community.",My son tested positive for Covid last week. He has firmly adhered to guidelines and doesn‚Äôt know where he picked it up from. His 3 room mates who weren‚Äôt as strict about wearing masks and not gathering all tested negative. The biggest issue is that BYU doesn‚Äôt have a firm plan in place and isn‚Äôt responding quickly enough to what is happening. My son was finally isolated 24 hours after his test came back::: and it took another 50 plus hours after that for his case worker to finally contact him. Luckily::: he had already texted everyone that he had had been into contact. Some people chose to get tested and others didn‚Äôt. He can only pass along the information. The other issue I see is just how difficult going into isolation is. These kids often feel sick and are placed in a situation in which they are entirely alone. It was stressful figuring out meals and how best to support him from afar. I think this needs to be better handled. My son felt a complete lack of compassion and I felt that he had been totally left alone and that he had no one checking in on him (until he received a call from his case worker 3 days later) and this is unacceptable. I understand that they are adults::: but I also believe that BYU has a responsibility try to take care of them. I worry that this may be preventing kids from being tested who probably should be. Without testing we can‚Äôt monitor or understand the way this virus is working.,Sounds like something's wrong with Utah County lol,Your colleges and have no power to tell people how to live their life‚Äôs if you‚Äôre really that scared and worried about it then close your schools but y‚Äôall won‚Äôt do that cause you want our money so shut up and teach the stupid classes and stay out of peoples personal life‚Äôs or put your money where your mouth is and close your schools and refund people...,Thank you byu for getting together with uvu and addressing the students like this.

Imagine if regular influenza had not made the jump to humans until 2020 and we suddenly had 50:::000 excess deaths. We'd be locking down. But hindsight tells us we can live with it::: and viruses resulting in higher deaths because they're more contagious::: not because they're more intrinsically fatal.

It is perfectly ridiculous to go about whimpering and drawing long faces because the scientists have added one more chance of painful and premature death to a world which already bristled with such chances and in which death itself was not a chance at all::: but a certainty.

‚Äî ‚ÄúOn Living in an Atomic Age‚Äù (1948)","People do not think about this:
If the area under a flattened curve is much the same... What is the point?
(I know::: it was to keep hospitals from being overwhelmed. They have had time to assess and prepare::: and outside of NY they never got close to capacity. Relative to last year::: medical facilities are ghost towns with people avoiding or postponing non-covid matters.)
The relatively small amount of human suffering and death that come from this virus are not reduced by austere enforcements::: it's just dragged out over months (and years?)

Those at extreme risk (nursing home residents and staff::: chemo patients::: ect) should be the only ones quarantining (and they should be very strick about it).

All others::: especially young healthy college students::: should be living their lives and building the population's herd immunity. This is nature's vaccine if you will. A developed vaccine is going to take a while.

Look at Sweden: they did it right and they've had no 'second wave' like the US and elsewhere in europe. It's nearly over for them and their communities are intact.

Also::: even if on-campus students do their best::: you've got 6 or so students living together::: and each spends time with a different circle of classmates and co-workers. That is a recipe for virus spread even with masks. Regardless::: social interaction is important for humans. No need to be hard on students.

'2 weeks' became 'a few months'::: and will that become 'a few years'? You would never swear off driving because of the risk of death... Because you assess the benefits of transportation to be greater than the cost. We need to seriously reassess what an appropriate response looks like.

I don‚Äôt think the increasing numbers are due to ‚Äúpartying‚Äù or being irresponsible I think it‚Äôs just a mere matter of putting that many new people together who haven‚Äôt been around each other before i.e. new roommates living together etc. New roommates are not going to be wearing a mask around one another and if you‚Äôre asymptomatic you‚Äôre not going to know that you have Covid and possibly pass it to a roommate. I‚Äôm not saying some students weren‚Äôt being careless::: I‚Äôm just saying things need to be kept in perspective when it comes to percentage rates of people testing positive. When I went on campus with my daughter a few weeks ago everyone was wearing a mask and doing their best as I imagine most students are.,Hmm basically saying going to work is okay::: but being consumers and helping businesses survive isn't... so stop going out and contributing to the economy so we can further increase the unemployment percentage for when we all graduate. Got it!,Tyranny rears its ugly head again::: even in Utah County. So sad.,"Cases.... but there's no evidence that supports how many cases are 'sick' and how many are completely healthy (getting force tested but absolutely zero symptoms)

When at people going to wake up and fight back","To everyone saying ""how many deaths"" or ""there's a 99.7% survival rate""as an argument to reopen campus::: if all 43:::000 people at BYU::: roughly 100 (give or take) people will die. Which people in the BYU community should die so we can full open and stay open? In addition to that::: yes::: there is a 99.7% survival rate::: but how many people develop long term conditions from COVID? I know I did::: I now require an inhaler to walk to campus. I know countless other people my age did. But hey::: let's disregard science and fully reopen so 100 people can die and thousands develop long term conditions.",Whose deleting the comments? I've tried to like 3 comments but they were no longer available for comment. Were they deleted by the admin? Are we being censored?,"If masks work::: why the distance? If masks and distance work::: then why the continue in cases? Why are we not being told the end goal? Why are we only hearing bad things and things to scare us from the media? Why can thousands protest but 100 can‚Äôt watch a high school football game? I believe there are many false priests who oppress and wolves in sheep‚Äôs clothing among our government. We‚Äôre all just political pawns and the miracle vaccine will save us in November (Yes vaccine is scheduled to be ready by November::: what a coincidence!)

If you‚Äôre scared of COVID::: stay home. If you‚Äôre not::: go live your life and enjoy it. We don‚Äôt put the world on hold for strep::: the flu::: and so many other virus that kill thousands each year::: why is this different? Oh yeah because it‚Äôs an election year..

Do you remember when this all started? The roads were dead::: people were rarely outside. Playgrounds and even lakes were shut down. Yet the numbers kept rising somehow. We were ordered to wear masks and stay away.. 95% complied and the numbers still went up. We finally started getting things under control when guess what.. we were told ‚Äú COVID is spread by asymptotic people! but a symptomatic people can‚Äôt get tested because it will come back negative‚Äù In Michigan we were told to flatten the curve. Which we did in 14 days::: but the governor continued to restrict (she even said we couldn‚Äôt use boats with an engine on the lake::: row boats were fine though). Yet cases keep rising. Everyone in public has a mask on::: everyone is doing a pretty good job at standing on their colored lines like there getting ready for school recess. We‚Äôre being fed lies and miss lead. Wolves in sheep‚Äôs clothing are among us.","Maybe we should stick to common sense and listen to what intelligent medical experts (who have no skin in the game) advise. There‚Äôs this new concept called integrity. Something worth trying for sure! https://

T_rwHj8I","It‚Äôs the administrations
‚Äô job to create guidelines that have a chance of reaching their goal (reasonable Covid incidence rates). It‚Äôs the students responsibility to adhere to those guidelines and support the goal behind them (all students had to agree to this one paper) else face discipline personally or global repercussions in the form of the warnings found in this memo (stricter guidelines). It‚Äôs pretty simple. They‚Äôre just saying that::: so far::: the guidelines haven‚Äôt worked so they may need to be changed.
If the problem really is that a significant portion of students aren‚Äôt following the guidelines (just can‚Äôt make it through a year without parties and tunnel singing) then they have a chance to do better or else have an even worse college experience.
If the problem is with the guidelines themselves (in other words::: if the virus has spread despite reasonable attempts at social distancing for at campus classes::: mask wearing and random tests) then the guidelines still need to be changed to meet the goal of reasonable Covid incidence rates.

A whole separate conversation is whether their definition of reasonable Covid incidence rate is::: in fact::: ‚Äúreasonable‚ÄùüòÜ",No one should ever get tested unless you are deathly ill and need to go to the hospital::: and you should never tell if you are around someone that has tested!! If people would just stop this crazy testing !!! I‚Äôm in the medical field. Those tests we give people are not a covid 19 test. It is a generic covid. We‚Äôve all had a covid virus before!!! A covid 19 test can only be determined by blood and we only give those once you‚Äôre admitted to the hospital. So those daily numbers..... they are mostly just the regular flu and colds!!! A positive result does not mean you have covid 19!!! But.... they do get quite a bit of money for every positive test!,"I don‚Äôt know if I agree that the kids are scapegoats. We live directly among them. There are at least twice weekly large75-100 kids getting together in our neighborhood. Nary a mask in site.

I believe many of them are making good choices. Unfortunately many are not","I have a few legitimate questions. I hope that a few of you or maybe even the University leaders can provide legitimate answers. Based on the ""New"" Orange level Covid guidelines sent out by BYU University Communications one of the new restrictions pertains to all on campus recreational facilities Gyms::: Pools and such are all included in the following: ‚Ä¢ ""All campus recreational facilities will be closed except for use by approved groups::: including academic classes."" What exactly are ""approved groups?"" Are these ""approved groups"" the schools sports teams? Since The football team has been seen practicing and the pool team just this morning was seen at the pool::: all close together::: certainly NOT social distancing at all::: I am assuming the answer to that is a ""Yes::: No one EXCEPT those who belong to a school team may use the Gyms ect..."" Next question: Since these are newly listed COVID restrictions::: Why are only team members allowed to use the Gyms and other recreational facilities? Has it been proven by the school that team members don't contract covid or don't test positive for covid but the rest of the student population is responsible for all of the new cases of late? Isn't that blatant discrimination of the majority of the student body who DONT participate on a school team? Another question. The majority of students in a dorm on campus::: are taking mostly zoom classes with very little in person classroom experiences. Everyone knows how tiny these dorms are and with 6 people in each it must be difficult to find space for every ""Zoom"" class. There is a huge ""activity room"" in each dorm. Students WERE using this room as a quiet place to go to for their Zoom classes but now that the ""New"" Orange Level Covid guidelines were issues those rooms are locked to students to use to study and watch zoom classes. Are these activity rooms also closed only to the general student population but open to students who participate on a team? (sarc) Why are these huge rooms closed to students who simply want a quiet place to watch their zoom classes. How in the world is locking thise room in each dorm to those that want to study::: helping keep the spread of covid down when there is never more than 2 students in one of these huge rooms at a time? Asking for a friend.","Yeah::: staying at home will stop a respiratory virus from spreading. That's why the flu virus goes away during the colder months when everyone is forced to stay inside... ü§•ü§•ü§•ü§™ü§™ü§™

Wow! I expected this kind of stupidity from YBU::: but I'm surprised UVU stuck their heads up their butts::: too. Fascist idiots.",Sounds like a threat::: is it not? Sounds like coercion::: is it not? Aren't you aware we live in a Republic where we are SELF governed? It sounds like you're trying to assert authority that you do not have::: is that correct? You're asserting that you have the power over people's bodies::: but that side steps the law of creation does it not? You get government funding no?,"Yeah::: I see people at my apartment complex just hanging out or doing activities without masks. I suppose a germaphobic introvert like myself doesn‚Äôt face the risk that people who attend these activities do::: but I can only avoid such germs as long as the virus doesn‚Äôt get in my apartment of 6.

Honestly::: I kind of wish they had just done fall semester online. I understand that this makes it hard for certain majors to get things done::: but if the school needs to go to online anyway::: it could have saved hundreds of people the troubles associated with getting the virus.","What a moron. Seriously::: just change the ""COVID-19"" for any other benign sickness and the letter's ridiculousness becomes apparent to all.","If you're afraid of COVID-19 just wait until the vaccine comes out::: it has the potential of being far worse than anyone can imagine.
If you want a Zombie apocalypse::: this new vaccine just might do it.

Message from Robert F. Kennedy::: Jr.
""To all my patients:
I would like to draw your attention urgently to important issues related to the next Covid-19 vaccination. For the first time in the history of vaccination::: the so-called last generation mRNA vaccines intervene directly in the genetic material of the patient and therefore alter the individual genetic material::: which represents the genetic manipulation::: something that was already forbidden and until then considered criminal. This intervention can be compared to genetically manipulated food::: which is also highly controversial. Even if the media and politicians currently trivialize the problem and even stupidly call for a new type of vaccine to return to normality::: this vaccination is problematic in terms of health::: morality and ethics::: and also in terms of genetic damage that::: unlike the damage caused by previous vaccines::: will be irreversible and irreparable.
Dear patients::: after an unprecedented mRNA vaccine::: you will no longer be able to treat the vaccine symptoms in a complementary way. They will have to live with the consequences::: because they can no longer be cured simply by removing toxins from the human body::: just as a person with a genetic defect like Down syndrome::: Klinefelter syndrome::: Turner syndrome::: genetic cardiac arrest::: hemophilia::: cystic fibrosis::: Rett syndrome::: etc.)::: because the genetic defect is forever!
This means clearly: if a vaccination symptom develops after an mRNA vaccination::: neither I nor any other therapist can help you::: because the damage caused by the vaccination will be genetically irreversible. In my opinion::: these new vaccines represent a crime against humanity that has never been committed in such a big way in history. As Dr. Wolfgang Wodarg::: an experienced doctor::: said: In fact::: this ""promising vaccine"" for the vast majority of people should be FORBIDDEN::: because it is genetic manipulation! ""
The vaccine::: developed and endorsed by Anthony Fauci and funded by Bill Gates::: uses experimental mRNA technology. Three of the 15 human guinea pigs (20%) experienced a ""serious adverse event"".
...
Note: messenger RNA or mRNA is the ribonucleic acid that transfers the genetic code of the DNA of the cell nucleus to a ribosome in the cytoplasm::: that is::: the one that determines the order in which the amino acids of a protein bind and act as a mold or pattern for the synthesis of that protein.

Vaccine COVID = IRREVERSIBLE GENETIC DAMAGE - A CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY.
[25/08 6:05 p. m.] +58 414-0750240: SCHOOLING FOR THE POPULATION TO BE NO MORE ENGAGED:
DOES CORONAVIRUS EXIST OR NOT?
- CLARIFICATION:
1. DOES THE VIRUS EXIST?
Yes::: like many other viruses.
2. DOES IT HAVE A CURE?
Yes::: if you use the proper medicines and do not leave your health in the hands of corrupt and mercantile health systems.
3. ARE THERE GOOD DOCTORS?
Yes and many::: some are acting discreetly giving appropriate treatments::: others have been bolder and there are many videos in the networks talking about these treatments::: and many have been threatened::: disqualified or silenced.
4. ARE SCIENTISTS INVESTIGATING?
Yes::: and there is a world union calling for more doctors and scientists called Doctors and Scientists for Truth::: to expose the falsity of the treatment they have given to the bug issue.
5. IS IT A PANDEMIC?
No. The WHO changed the term that referred to the pandemic::: before the bug was launched in order to end the pandemic.
6. IS IT CONTAGIOUS?
Yes::: like all flu.
7. IF I CATCH THE VIRUS::: DOES IT MEAN THAT I WILL DIE?
No. If you have symptoms::: just take the appropriate medicine from the first day (strengthen the immune system::: take anti-inflammato
ry and anti-influenza)
and cure yourself at home.
8. CAN IT BE PREVENTED?
Yes::: being as clean as you should be::: and maintaining a high immune system. And you also have: Ozone Therapy::: Chlorine Dioxide with the preventive protocol.
9. ARE THE COUNT OF INFECTED AND DEAD BY THE VIRUS CERTAIN?
No. In the USA it was discovered that any data::: would be in fact 10% of that number::: because the causes of deaths were other diseases::: and the tests are not reliable::: they give false positives.
10. ARE ASYMPTOMATIC REAL CASES OF POSITIVES?
The human being has many microorganisms and viruses in the body and this does not mean that you are a sick or infected person::: or that you have the virus::: however::: the viruses that are supposedly ""so aggressive"" present some symptoms in the patients because the body releases alarms from an intruder (fever::: headache::: vomiting::: etc.) and according to Koch's theory the answer is NO.
11. WAS THE VIRUS CREATED?
Yes::: in a laboratory.
13. FOR WHAT PURPOSE?
To be the excuse to restrict freedoms::: to change the current economic system to a more oppressive / enslaving::: scary::: blind flock obedience.
14. ARE MANY COUNTRIES PART OF THIS MALICIOUS PLAN?
Yes.
15. WILL WE GET OUT OF THIS
Yes. And all those who contributed to the deaths and the plan will fall::: and they will pay for what they did.
16. MUST I BE AFRAID?
No. Fear diminishes your immune system and makes you mentally controllable.
17. IS THE MEDIA PART OF THE PLAN?
Yes. The owners of the media are accomplices. This is called mind control.
18. WHAT SHOULD I DO?
You protect yourself::: and if you get sick you already know how to heal yourself at home::: or with your trusted doctor who will not commit to the abandonment protocol.
19. SHOULD I BE VACCINATED?
No. If you get healthy::: vaccines bring chemicals::: heavy metals and a series of ""bugs"" that will only affect your health more in the medium and long term::: both physically and mentally. It's your body::: and it's your right to decide about it::: and about your physical and mental health. Would you trust a vaccine after a virus has been created to exterminate humanity?
20. IS THIS A WAR?
Yes.! And we will be victorious! We need to stay together and wake other people up::: giving a lot of information.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. - Wikipedia",Have all you returned missionaries from southeast Asia noticed that somehow this virus is NOT spreading around all that much in the places where they eat fermented shrimp paste the most regularly? I think glucosamine (via inhibition of il-6 activity and N/O-linked glycosylation) is helping them not get very sick and infect each other. I'm just a housewife with limited time::: but I'll bet some of you biology and premed students would have fun tracking this down. Especially if you've lived there and seen how close together they are packed.,Nathalie and friends come and join me in the frontlines::: then you will find out if you won‚Äôt care about the number of cases of COVID-19.,"This is insanity. Look at the statistics as reported by https://
coronavirus.utah
.gov/
case-counts/

The data is not very specific in the College age range::: of the age ranges 0-1::: 1-14::: 15-24::: and Unknown there have only been 2 confirmed deaths. That‚Äôs a death rate of 0.009% of cases. Now let‚Äôs assume both deaths occurred in the 15-24 age bracket::: that would be a death rate of 0.01% of those infected. And the data does not show if those cases had any comorbidities or other conditions.

According to the US Census data::: there are 522:::832 people in the 15-24 age bracket. With 2 deaths in that bracket::: that is a possible death rate of 0.00038% of students from High School to College.

Please tell me where the problem is?

Grown adults are complaining about students having fun at parties. Students get the probabilities. They understand the risks. It‚Äôs as close to zero as any other possibilities::: maybe less.

In contrast::: last year there were 109 suicides in the 18-24 age bracket in Utah. What is BYU doing about suicides? What is the amount of time BYU spends preventing suicides in contrast to the time spent stopping parties that students are actually having fun at? The concentration of effort placed on positive cases of Covid is absurd. Students get over viruses::: they don‚Äôt get over suicides. If you‚Äôre scared for yourselves::: don‚Äôt go to their parties and you wear a mask and goggles and your tin foil hats.","Read your OSHA standards! https://

"As the 2020 U.S. elections approach and the pandemic persists::: many states are considering a mandatory vote-by-mail system as a safe alternative to in-person voting. But policymakers are fiercely divided: Will vote-by-mail favor the Democrats::: mobilizing left-leaning voters who ordinarily avoid or miss the polls?

According to a new BYU study::: probably not.

Published in the journal Science Advances::: the research looked at voting patterns in areas that have historically implemented vote-by-mail for federal elections. The BYU professor and his co-author found that while vote-by-mail did increase overall voter turnout by about 2 to 3 percentage points::: it did not change the outcome of races.

‚ÄúWe ran dozens of analyses and every single time we found no impact in partisan vote shares. So whether you‚Äôre advocating for vote-by-mail because you think it‚Äôs going to be really good for your party or advocating against it because you think it‚Äôs going to be bad for your party::: you‚Äôre probably wasting your time:::‚Äù said Michael Barber::: a BYU professor and co-author of the study.

NEWS.BYU.EDU
Forty years of voting history reveals vote-by-mail does not give either party an edge",8/26/2020 19:45,My concern has always been about the sheer load. If every person voted by mail::: that is a lot more to be counted. A lot more to be delivered. I'd rather not burden the postal service . Besides::: after my sister's wedding pictures got lost in US mail::: I haven't really trusted it since.,You can stand in line at the grocery store but not to vote. Makes sense.,Why is BYU - a church owned school - publishing a story that has such political implications? Besides::: the real issue isn't comparable to absentee voting or traditional mail in voting when you request a ballot. The real issue is that hundreds of thousands of ballots will be mailed to people who have moved or died - resulting in hundreds and thousands of NEW opportunities for voter fraud.,If we can shop at Costco we can vote in person!,Almost a half million Mail-in votes were discounted in the primary elections this year alone. Perhaps no particular party has an edge::: but that‚Äôs a lot of voters who had no say in the election process...the voters certainly didn‚Äôt have an edge.,There is a difference between proactively sending ballots out to everyone and anyone and people requesting an absentee ballot through the mail.,Better yet::: get your mail in ballot::: vote it::: sign it and TAKE IT TO YOUR POLLING PLACE YOURSELF!! In our town::: it's a mailbox outside the library where you can drive up with no one around and drop it in. No risk of contracting COVID.,A scroll through the Twitter feeds of the co-authors doesn't really increase my confidence of impartiality here. What a shame.,If the goverment can't figure out how to get stimulus checks to everyone like they promised (cause I know people that have yet to see anything from the stimulus checks)::: why should people trust that mail in voting will be any more effective? I really think it's a lack of trust issue at this point. The government and USPS::: which would be facilitating the mail In Voting::: has already shown that they drop the ball too often to be trusted. I know that's the reason I would rather vote in person.,My biggest worry is voter fraud and ballots being mailed out correctly.,Vote by mail via absentee ballot is not the issue. The issue is mass mailing ballots to every name listed on precincts. Many move::: die::: etc and their names are not removed easily::: at least in CA. This opens door for wide scale dishonest voting.,Yeah::: wrong. BYU::: get your act together. Mail in voting is rife with fraud and not the same thing as absentee ballots. I can't believe you would post this.,I have several questions::: though::: BYU. How did your study determine that there was no measurable effect? How could you do that without twice holding a vote::: and then measuring the results? The other questions I have are these: Who is going to count the millions upon millions of mail-in ballots that could come in during this election::: and by when will they be counted? How many will be tossed aside or lost? What is 2 or 3 percentage points across millions of voters::: and what impact would that represent?,There is a vast difference between absentee ballots and universal mail in voting. The study posted here is academically dishonest and manipulative. Sad to see from my Alma mater,I don't trust them doing a nationwide vote in where something is going TO the system vs something coming from the system.,One people need to understand the difference between vote by mail::: and absentee voting. Vote by mail will just get ballots out to everyone and who‚Äôs to even say those ballots will get to people::: and if they will even get back in time or be counted correctly. Absentee voting you have to request and there‚Äôs tons of things in place to make sure it‚Äôs done right. Secondly if you can go to your Walmart::: Costco::: and many other places and wear your mask and social distance you can go and vote.,If they can riot and protest in person and the governors and mayors allow it then they can vote in person.,I still don't trust it. I was changed to democratic in 2016 without my knowledge or consent. I didn't even know about it until I got the ballot.,Does your study take into account all the fake ballots? The purposeful manipulation going into this particular election? ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,BYU is getting scarier by the moment - California/ liberal hires.....and east coast too! Sickening!!!!,Tell me.... what credibility does left leaning BYU have on this issue?,BYU is quickly losing credibility....,It‚Äôs less about giving one side an edge and more that we‚Äôve seen multiple examples of the Democrat party manipulating numbers in past elections and this is just too easy of a system to cheat. If voting isn‚Äôt important enough to you for you to carve out some time on Election Day then you probably aren‚Äôt informed enough to cast a well thought out vote.,"We just had in-person voting yesterday for a school bond election (idaho). As a poll worker::: we offered a sanitization station with hand sanitizers and masks::: social distancing::: electronic check-in::: cleaning supplies to use on supplies and tables between voters. All wore masks. Everyone who came out appreciated it and felt ""safe"". Total overkill IMO::: but it worked. There's no reason to avoid in-person voting in November.",Another study for the right to be convinced of what everyone already knows. We shouldn‚Äôt be wasting studies on this but I guess here we are ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Go Cougs,Probably wasting your time ... sort of like voting. That's why I like vote by mail. It wastes the least amount of my time.,Sometimes the professors at BYU need to get out of the UT bubble.,When the postal workers union endorsed Joe Biden - how do any citizens who don‚Äôt vote Joe trust the safe delivery of their ballot?,"Fraud is not an issue. It‚Äôs been proven over and over. Great study here showing now that one form of voting doesn‚Äôt favor one party over another.

And then looking through the comments the level of anti-intellectu
alism and conspiracy insanity on a page that should be dedicated to the search for truth is really sad.

Nobody reading this hasn't stood in a line for a less important purpose in the last 6 months.,There should be a choice. Vote by mail or go to the polls.,30% of Mail is lost over the course of a year. The post office has already said that they don‚Äôt know how it will be possible because some laws just don‚Äôt line up. With the amount of ballots being brought in people will have to send them in 15 days prior in order for their vote to count. A lot of votes will potentially late or lost in the post office network,If people can go to the store::: they can vote in person. Voter fraud is rampant. Mail in ballots do not have the many checks absentee voter ballots do.,Vote by mail will favor the dishonest. It's that simple. Too many opportunities for fraud and not enough resulting oversight::: because oversight becomes such a huge task in the Vote-by-mail scenario.,I think you missed the point on this... Your Theory is only good if everyone is 100% honest.,There are huge differences between mail-in ballots that have safety measures in place to verify who completed the ballot (or things such as absentee ballots which are requested by the voter) versus the massive mailing of live ballots to residences based on outdated voter registrations. The latter are the problem & are ripe for fraud!,If it‚Äôs safe enough to stand in line at Walmart it‚Äôs safe enough to vote.,You‚Äôve missed the entire issue. It‚Äôs not a matter of whether it favors one party over another. It‚Äôs that voter fraud prevalent with mail-in voting. Democrats::: actually Leftists within the Democrat party::: with their ‚Äúends justify the means‚Äù attitude are more likely to commit such fraud. So::: yes::: it does favor one party.,I still get mail for my ex::: my friend who lived here for a couple months while her house was being built and even her husband who died before she ever lived here.,The only election fraud will be by and/or on behalf of the current administration.,Simply mailing a ballot to a voter's last known address has fewer verification checks than absentee voting where voters must request a ballot. Both use the mail::: but the controls are different.,The amount of Voter Fraud with mail in voting is way too much. People are getting mailed ballots to people that are dead. There was even a story of a dead cat that got a ballot. In the last election for local stuff::: I got 2 ballots. There are many instances where ballot harvesters are caught whether through the postal workers or otherwise.,What if the reason you are opposed to it is because of neither of those reasons?,This election is different than most.,"Also::: you're getting ratioed now which is pretty hard to do on Facebook.

The Democrats did vote by mail for their primary::: and no one knows who won.,The issue isn't which party it would favor::: the problem is voter fraud.

Recent local elections show you how elections can be manipulated. Also the motivation for fraud is much higher given the political climate and that is something that cannot be measured.

Try again.,"The problem is sending ballots to names in the rolls that didn't deliberately request one. Mass mailing means there'll be blank ballots sent to address of the deceased::: people who have moved::: etc.::: which enables fraudulent votes to be cast (for either party).

A more secure election is one where individuals must actively request to receive a ballot and re-confirm their address. This is what has been going on for a while and it's fine.

Also::: any logical person can see that keeping polling places open for those that prefer it is not a problem. We have restaurants and grocery stores and we're fine.

We are not talking about absentee ballots‚Äîbut mailing ballots out to everyone without anyone having to prove you are who it says on the ballot!,There are thousands of people who handle the mail in ballots and not everyone is honest. It‚Äôs been known that mail in ballots have been thrown away by workers. The envelopes say on the outside if you‚Äôre republican or democrat.,"You sort of missed the point::: BYU.

The point of concern isn't whether or not simply ""vote by mail"" gives one party an ""edge"" over the other. I don't think anyone believes that if the vote is by mail::: that more people in one party will vote than the other. There's no reason for anyone to believe::: nor have I heard anyone say::: that one party uses the USPS more often than another::: or will refuse to vote if it's by mail. (Unless Green Party people refuse to do vote by mail because it uses more paper and kills more trees and they all decide not to vote? Somehow I doubt that.)

The issue is whether or not vote by mail makes it easier to commit voter FRAUD. Obviously::: there is a need for people to be able to vote by mail. Some people just can't get out to do it. But the concern is that the MORE vote-by-mail there is::: the more FRAUD there will be. A quick look at the CONVICTIONS of voter fraud cases shows that a LOT of them were committed THROUGH mail in::: absentee voting and creating false registrations for mail-in voting. And all jurisdictions KNOW that.

There have already been several instances::: just in the past couple months. People have been getting ballots for people who USED to live at their address. One woman had 4 ballots for 4 different people sent to her. Another woman noticed that the bar code on the envelopes included an ""R"" on hers::: and a ""D"" on her brother's::: and the city VERIFIED that the codes include R and D for party affiliation. There are more instances all over the country.

The other issue is the ""why"". Why ""mandatory"" mail in voting? It's very difficult to believe that the why is truly for Covid safety concerns::: when restaurants are open::: schools are open::: grocery stores are open::: and heaven knows::: the protestors and rioters are free to roam the streets with no social distancing being enforced. The ONLY reason to make it mandatory::: would be to allow more fraud to occur.

""Safely returning to campus is important for our community::: but it will be challenging. For us to succeed in this new and different environment::: we all have to play our part::: making adjustments that::: while perhaps are personally inconvenient::: are necessary for the good of the whole. The BYU mission statement says that all relationships within the BYU community should reflect 'a loving::: genuine concern for the welfare of our neighbor.' That love for each other is what can make this year‚Äôs BYU experience a remarkable period of growth for each member of our university community. We look forward to safely gathering soon.""

Earlier this week::: some important new safety measures were announced. You can see what those are::: and take a look at some ways this semester will look::: feel and work different in this photo essay from BYU Photo:

Why is BYU making it hard for excellent students to live outside a living quarters where other 5 students live and threaten to not let them on campus just because the housing is not approved? My son lived in Mexico for 2 years serving a mission in places I wouldn't approved::: he has lived in a very nice place with roommates that follow church rules just like my son. Why is BYU so hard but let lesbians::: gays on campus???!!,I hope BYU will show love to their neighbors by closing down campus. Those of us who live in the valley are concerned with the rapid spread of COVID at BYU. One of my children has asthma and I‚Äôm concerned with my BYU neighbor spreading COVID and affecting the whole county and state. BYU rejected relief aid that could have been used to lower tuition and implement online classes.

Also::: what is BYU doing to address the concerns of students who are concerned about their HIPAA privacy rights and having to waive it to a third party that runs the app? And if a student is working remotely off-campus::: can they forego using the app?

I also want to say that I am grateful for all the time and consideration that has been put into all these decisions. And I care for my neighbor by wearing masks and social distancing::: and will get tested if the need arises. But if I can retain my HIPAA and other privacy rights simultaneously:::
I would like to do that.

"A large-scale project from BYU professors and students is gathering lost stories of a generation that survived extreme hardships under the Khmer Rouge regime (1975-79) where nearly 2 million Cambodians were killed or died.

As a community that relies on oral and not written histories::: many of the stories of past Cambodian generations are being lost.

Known as the Cambodian Oral History Project::: the group from BYU has collected nearly 5:::000 interviews for this project through the help of local Cambodian leaders.

Telling their stories can help the Cambodian people heal in a small way from the devastation they faced years ago::: helping family members understand who their parents and grandparents are and also who they are.

Telling an untold story from inside you remains the best therapy for PTSD clients in particular the KR‚Äôs survivors. I‚Äôm one of those who‚Äôd narrowly escaped this holocaust. For over 30 years living in a third country::: I‚Äôd tried hard to erase the scar of this bloody past::: but I can‚Äôt. The more I‚Äôd tried to forgive::: the more I can‚Äôt forget. Everyday::: I‚Äôd tried to run away from the bloody past::: the past caught up on me faster and stronger. It was like running away from a mountain. The faster you run::: the closer and bigger the mountain appears behind you. But I‚Äôd tried all::: working two jobs::: burring myself in schoolwork::: involving in community activities::: never talking about the past::: etc. Not a single effort had worked. The scar of the past is too deep to erase. I still slept with nightmares. I still saw the tyrants with guns and cleavers chasing after me in my dream. I decided to walk straight back to my past. That was six years ago. I was tired living and walking with a bagful of the tragic past on my back. Somehow::: it wasn‚Äôt easy::: especially when I went back to an unknown graveyard where a man told me that he had buried my two beautiful children who‚Äôd perished one after another from prolonged starvation. The dark memory returned so fresh::: so vivid that I felt decimated::: hopeless. I sobbed. My family of nine who‚Äôd walked and crawled together along Highway 5 during the evacuation day in April 1975::: only three had survived the Pol-Pot‚Äôs barbaric regime. Each of us has story to tell. Yours could be more painful than of mine. But ours could be less tragic than of our friends next door. Come out and tell your story. Of course we can‚Äôt rewind the 3 year and 8 months life struggles in one sentence::: but let the people know about you. Let the world know about the almost forgotten Khmer Rouge‚Äôs tyranny.

"A new analysis of 115+ studies on the effectiveness of masks in controlling COVID-19 has gotten a lot of attention with stories from the Deseret News::: The Salt Lake Tribune::: KUER 90.1 and others today.

The analysis has also gone viral on Twitter and is spreading throughout Instagram via a spotlight in our story that just published.

What prompted the report: BYU professor Ben Abbott seeing a lengthy debate about masks::: where else::: but right here on Facebook. üôÇ (Details in the KUER story we've linked to.)

The comprehensive analysis by Dr. Abbott and three of his students provides important insight and context about mask wearing amid this global pandemic. Overall::: the researchers conclude from the research that:

""Masks could be one of the most powerful and cost-effective tools to stop COVID-19 and accelerate the economic recovery.""

Within the studies::: the researchers found that masks are highly safe::: with only minor and uncommon side effects. In addition to many medical studies::: public masking has been proven safe among children::: adults and the elderly.

""There is now convincing evidence from multiple controlled experiments and field observations that wearing masks reduces the transmission of COVID-19 for healthcare workers and the public. Most of this evidence is COVID-19 specific and has emerged in the past few months.""

BYU Researcher Says The Science Is Crystal Clear: Wear A Mask",7/21/2020 1:18,Don't mind us. Just checking in periodically to look at the comments and ...,"My opinion about this study has to do with the study itself and has nothing to do with my thoughts on mask wearing.

As a scientist myself::: I have two major problems with this report. One is that there is no original research in this report. It is a study of studies::: which I have no way to verify any of the methods used or data collected. I cannot simply accept a conclusion or what someone tells me the study says. In general::: I will totally ignore studies with no original research for this reason.
Two::: this is outside of the area of expertise of everyone involved. While there are some things that translate between scientific disciplines::: there are many things that don't. Being a scientist of any sort generally qualifies you to read and have an understanding of any report::: but does not qualify you to publish your conclusion.

I am sure they had good intentions. But::: I cannot (and really we should not) accept their conclusions.",This study is the answer to the wrong question. In a pandemic you are supposed to quarantine the sick::: not restrict the healthy. The entire COVID-19 response is an assault on our liberties. Far more people will die from the response to the pandemic than will be killed by the pandemic. Every job that feeds a family is an essential job.,Good work! Thank you for doing this vital research. It will bless many lives. God bless ‚ù§Ô∏è,Ok here‚Äôs what I don‚Äôt understand. My opinions (whether they be political or personal) aside::: if people are so scared about spreading the virus so much::: why does the answer ALWAYS have to be ‚Äúwear a mask?‚Äù Regardless of whether people believe it‚Äôs the right thing to keep other people safe or whether the Leftist have an agenda with the virus and the mandatory use of masks::: why can‚Äôt there be an alternative solution to this whole problem? If the problem itself is the spreading of the virus::: aren‚Äôt there other ways to take care of it? Why not wear a face shield if people are so scared of the spreading? Can‚Äôt that be a compromise to Pro-Maskers and Anti-Maskers if anything?,Scientists will take a theory and try to pass it off as fact. Science is great when they actually do have some facts but this is beyond their scope of knowledge. Fishing in the dark is what I call it.,I do wonder::: if mask wearing is so powerful at preventing the spread of COVID-19::: how did it spread so quickly in the cities in China where the population wears masks on a daily basis::: often N95 masks?,Take it with a grain of salt and don't let someone else do the research for you. Most of the sources are from 2020. Not enough time to provide solid evidence that any study they did actually works. Also claiming the local news or BBC as a source is not a good idea either if you are trying to prove a point,Hi. My husband was one of the students who worked on this paper. First::: they received zero funding from BYU to do this research. There was absolutely no agenda. Second::: they looked at ALL of the data. Over 115 studies! They did not pick and choose studies that supported a certain ideology. They looked at all of the evidence::: explored all of the science::: and broke it down so the average person could understand it. Please::: just open the paper. You‚Äôll see how much work they put it and how in depth they went. You‚Äôll see that all of their sources are credible and peer reviewed. They did this out of their own time and free will because they wanted to explore the evidence (both pros and cons) of wearing masks. The evidence was overwhelming. Please don‚Äôt assume everything you read online is true. Don‚Äôt disregard the 115+ credible sources for the one you found online. Read the evidence yourself and form an educated opinion before you blindly attack those just trying to get to the bottom of this issue.,Say what you want. I don't trust anyone about this issue::: though I have read a great deal of stuff that is totally opposite of you and they make more sense.,"Can't see people's faces...no emotions...phys

This makes everything so confusing.,Are there maybe some anti-maskers on here who think they're being asked to wear masks all the time? Because you're not.

Fine one day and gone the next. There are many different strains and you have no way of being able to predict which you have and how badly it will hit you,D&C 45:31 says that ‚Äúa desolating sickness shall cover the land.‚Äù The more arguments and disunity I see from church members here::: the more I think COVID-19 fits the bill.

I‚Äôm seeing the desolation::: in real time::: of church members who are becoming very disunified‚Äîthe opposite of what Zion is. My opinion is that we should follow our church leaders on this. I don‚Äôt live in Utah::: but the advice to wear a mask shouldn‚Äôt only apply to Utahns. Some are saying that they won‚Äôt wear a mask unless it comes from the prophet::: but he has delegated authority to others. Moses tried to do all the work of prophet on his own until he was advised by Jethro to delegate smaller matters to others and only focus on the big things. It‚Äôs so sad to see how truly ‚Äúdesolating‚Äù this disease is::: not only for its medical issues.,Funny how the anti maskers I‚Äôve seen have never actually treated COVID patients.ü§î,The scientific research goes both ways. I can find many studies showing both sides. What would be interesting is to find someone who does a study where the results come out opposite of their political beliefs. If anyone knows of one please let me know. I have yet to see that.,So::: only 80% of people need to wear masks in order to be better than a national shutdown? Cool. I'll be hanging out in the other 20%,Sorry....I will not. And I am just disappointed that BYU has participated in this.....,If you truly love one another::: wear a mask,Sounds political to me. And the last line of the article::: ‚ÄúThe evidence suggests that if we could all ‚Äî 80%::: or more::: of us ‚Äî wear masks for several weeks::: we could get this under control and start getting back to normal.‚Äù is a joke because we‚Äôve been told something different beginning in March. Remember when this was supposed to ‚Äúflatten the curve‚Äù?? That happened. There is no proof that 80% of people wearing a mask will end the governmental control of this pandemic.,"I'd hate to see how you do the rest of your ""research"".",I refute mask wearing.

Meta studies over more than decades show non-medical masks are ineffective against viruses including influenza and H1N1. There is a consensus in the medical world that the most effective means to avoid infection is WASH YOUR HANDS::: DON'T TOUCH YOUR FACE AND MAINTAIN PHYSICAL DISTANCE. If wearing a mask makes you feel safer::: you are free to do so even if there is no solid data to support it.,Um::: you don't 'stop' a virus. Flattening the curve means the same amount of infections over a longer time period. Not stopping it ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,"This is why it is important to check the sources of even reputable organizations like BYU. One assistant professor of ecosystem ecology and 3 students is considered a comprehensive review and analysis of the data pertaining to mask wearing? ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

ion-strategy-is
-not-viable/",Funny::: only after Covid are we finding that over the counter masks are effective::: where hundreds of pre-Covid studies proved they do not work. I guess those pre-Covid hacks were just wrong.,"What am I missing? With all due respect a doo-rag covering your face does nothing. It has been said it‚Äôs like trying to stop mosquitoes from flying through a chain link fence. A placebo at best. Those blue surgical masks seem to be the other most common mask. They are also virtually useless too. Why? They are made to be used in a sterile environment::: like an operating room...a room where there are no tiny virus floating around. The blue mask is made to reduce things that are roughly 200x bigger like bacteria from the human mouth. Also::: they have virtually no seal face to mask. The topic of droplets and aerosols came up. Here too the masks do very little. You can make a small case that if you cough::: droplets are suppressed. Droplets fall to the ground quickly::: so that is not really the issue. What about aerosol? Like I said::: no cloth or surgical mask is stopping a tiny virus size particle. If you are talking N95 or N100::: they can make a difference. But reality shows that no one in any quantity has those. And face shields are really needed with them to do the best job. With the virus having a 99.65% survival rate anyhow::: wearing a mask is not going to make a difference. Personally::: I wear one to make others ""feel"" better::: but it does little. Wash your hands::: stay apart (no riots & looting please). That will help more that a mask in the outdoors. No??","So::: is the goal again to slow the spread so that the availability of health care resources is not overwhelmed? Because the only end to this pandemic is innoculation::: either by infection and recovery or a vaccine. Run-and-hide isn't gonna get us to the other side of this.

There are a few references in the meta-analysis that suggest that masking is intended to ""stop the spread"" and a lot of the media messaging continues to imply (brow-beat::: more like) that masking will help us end this faster. That's not going to happen. We'll just rubber band from a low infection rate to a high infection rate until enough people have the antibodies that this is effectively over. The theoretical ideal::: given the lack of a safe and effective and widely available vaccine::: is for the virus to spread as quickly as possible without overwhelming hospitals and with special precautions to isolate high-risk individuals.

If we need to mask up in order to manage the availability of health care resources without unnecessarily dragging this out::: then great. So far::: that hasn't been the case and::: as has been pointed out::: the politicos and media have burned up what little credibility they had left when they kept shifting the goalposts to keep people scared when their initial apocalyptic forecast of 2M people dying fell completely flat. Classic ""boy who cried wolf"" scenario.

I got the cringes from Goldman Sachs's analysis that masking would prevent ""the need for a second round of economic shutdowns"". The available data analysis on that demonstrated that there was no statistically significant correlation between the severity of economic lockdowns and the spread of COVID-19 (offhand::: I recall that the p-value was in the neighborhood of .35). Anybody suggesting this route again should be immediately dismissed and discredited.

I appreciate the honest effort to show what's out there in the medical literature::: but it's difficult to trust what anyone is saying. The politicization of the issue was its downfall from the beginning.",It‚Äôs funny but I‚Äôve seen several other reports of doctors refute wearing masks because of the harm it does making people breathe back in their own carbon dioxide::: other pathogens and bacteria. The reason you don‚Äôt see a lot of these reports and studies is because YouTube and other social media outlets keep shutting them down and won‚Äôt let the truth be known about them.,Okay where are the 115 studies you researched? I would love an index referencing each one::: so I can do my own research. Nothing in this article shows where you came up with your claims. What the science is to back up your claims. Also::: by saying only those who can not take them off themselves should be exempt from wearing them::: shows your ignorance to those adults and children with special needs. Specifically sensory issues::: or trauma related anxiety::: ect. This article is not based on any scientific evidence or proof. It's from a self decided expert.,"What if it happen like this?

BYU study::: June 2021::: ‚Äúmandatory vaccines are the only way to prevent the spread of COVID-19.‚Äù

Marriott school study::: September 2021::: digitally imbedded vaccine ID chip is the only option to maintain the ability to buy and sell and keep the economy functioning. We must become a cashless society.

Conference::: October 2021. Digital vaccine ID is the mark of the beast as foretold in Revelation 13.

BYU statement::: October 10::: 2021. ‚ÄúWe were wrong.‚Äù

Maybe it turns out differently and I sincerely hope I‚Äôm wrong::: but regardless the Overton window has officially shifted.

Those of us who are against the use of masks recognize the political manipulation and fear mongering. We are against the shifting Overton Window on this policy. Mandatory masks in schools during flu season would be considered unconscionable in October 2019.

On another note::: The secret combinations warned about throughout the Book of Mormon won‚Äôt let this good crisis go to waste. They‚Äôll say::: you don‚Äôt have to wear masks if you get the vaccine and show your Vax-ID.

Remember the Book of Mormon is a witness and warning for our day and the thing that destroyed both the Jaredite and Nephite civilizations was secret combinations.

Will Latter-day Saints stand up against the great secret combination::: the mother of harlots::: the great and abominable church?

Or will they go to their Gadianton masters and ask them for salvation? ‚ÄúI‚Äôll wear your mask::: I‚Äôll get your shot::: I‚Äôll get your mark....‚Äù

Remember Ether 8::: Helaman 2:12-13::: and look up President Benson‚Äôs October 1988 talk ‚ÄúI testify.‚Äù

Is this what we were warned against? Maybe I‚Äôm wrong::: but when good citizens are chastised for not wearing masks and anarchists are excused during race riots::: I call BS.

And before you comment::: read Benson‚Äôs ‚Äò88 talk. ‚ÄúMore Highly organized::: more cleverly disguised::: and more powerfully promoted...‚Äù That was 30 years ago!!!

You‚Äôve been warned. Now sling your arrows and rocks....",Wow no one came up with a cogent answer to my question... which is what I am looking for... just personal attacks. I guess I have a valid point. doo-rags and those blue masks are basically placebos.,Shaming and mandating is the real issue. It doesn't surprise me to see support of that here.,masks are harmful and stop nothing. Ditto Vaxx.,"This science says otherwise. Who's science should we believe?? https://

üî•Dr. Jayanta Bhattacharya::: a medical professor at Stanford University
üî•Dr. Martin Kulldorff::: a medical professor at Harvard University
üî• Michael Levitt::: a structural biology professor at Stanford University
‚Äú..schools could reopen without enforcing mask-wearing::: citing schools in Sweden that remained open during the pandemic without masks in a recently published editorial in the Wall Street Journal::: co-authored by Bhattachayra.

‚ÄúAt this point::: we know that the benefits of a lockdown are small. ... All they do is push cases off into the future; it doesn‚Äôt actually prevent the disease from happening. And the costs are absolutely catastrophic::: enormous:::‚Äù Bhattacharya said.

Hunting for asymptomatic cases encourages pointless shutdowns. Protect the vulnerable instead.
Bhattacharya has also been vocal about lockdowns and mandates being ineffective in combating the virus‚Äô spread and recently came under fire for his participation in an antibody study that estimated the number of COVID-19 infections is significantly higher than numbers show::: Buzzfeed News reported.
Levitt::: who received the 2013 Nobel Prize in chemistry::: has been quoted in news outlets across the country for predicting back in March that the pandemic would not result in millions of deaths and months of shutdowns::: the L.A. Times reported.
A central question DeSantis posed to each was whether another statewide lockdown should no longer be an option. The three experts agreed that another lockdown would cause more damage than good.
Bhattacharya answered DeSantis by saying another lockdown in Florida ‚Äúwould be disastrous.‚Äù

Kulldorff said elected officials should be doing as much as possible to protect the elderly while still allowing children and young adults to go about life normally::: albeit with more frequent hand-washing.
‚ÄúThese sort of general lockdowns for closing schools::: for closing restaurants::: for closing beaches or whatever::: that actually has a detrimental effect on public health ...‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe are protecting very low-risk college students and professionals who can work from home while we are putting all the working-class people at risk because they have to work.‚Äù

Kulldorff said universities should operate ‚Äúalmost normally‚Äù and that students should be on campus attending in-person classes and that there does not need to be testing at colleges and universities.
People are still locking down and engaging in behavior which is likely to be detrimental in the long run:::‚Äù Levitt said.

- That black Americans will forever be victims of our shared history

Now::: it appears the New York Times agrees.

"In the United States::: girls represent only about 20% of autism diagnoses. While boys may simply be more likely to have autism than girls::: mental health professionals suspect that girls are also more adroit at suppressing autistic traits::: which could prevent their autism from being diagnosed::: if it is diagnosed at all::: until they are adults. Without an autism diagnosis::: any mental health concerns these women experience may be misinterpreted.

New BYU research draws attention to the challenges such women face. The study showed a strong correlation between how much women with autistic traits camouflage‚Äîhide or compensate for autistic qualities to fit in‚Äîand the severity of their mental health concerns.

"We‚Äôre announcing today plans for an in-person fall semester. This decision is subject to change depending on trends in disease prevalence and guidance from state and local governments.

The following are the general plans::: and we will keep detailed updates coming as fall semester draws near.

- Fall semester will start August 31 with a hybrid of in-person and remote delivery.
- Fall semester classes and exams will be remote after Thanksgiving break. If you travel home for Thanksgiving::: you‚Äôll be encouraged to finish the semester there.
- Face coverings will be required in all classroom settings::: inside all university buildings::: during interactions with campus guests or customers and in other areas where directed.
- Priority registration for fall semester will begin July 6. You‚Äôll be notified via YMessage of your specific registration date. Class schedules and the registration cart with be available later this afternoon.
- There will be a phased return to campus for students in on-campus housing.

The safety and protection of the BYU community is BYU‚Äôs first priority. BYU students in high-risk categories::: including older adults and those who are immunocompromised::: are strongly encouraged to not be on campus during fall semester 2020. Additionally::: those who will be caring for or sharing living spaces with high-risk individuals are encouraged to not be on campus during fall semester 2020. Remote coursework options are available for students in these situations. Students will have the ability during class registration to choose from those courses designated as ‚Äúlive remote delivery‚Äù and ""on-demand remote delivery."" High-risk students can contact their advisement centers or call (801) 422-4104 for registration assistance.

From President Worthen:

‚ÄúFor this to succeed::: we all have to play our part. The BYU mission statement says that all relationships within the BYU community should reflect ‚Äòa loving::: genuine concern for the welfare of our neighbor.‚Äô Certainly that can be our motivation for wearing a face covering::: washing our hands often::: and staying home when we're sick. We can react with empathy when someone we know tests positive for COVID-19. We can fight the virus of contempt with kindness even as we debate how to best respond as a society to the pandemic.

That genuine love for each other is what will make this year's BYU experience a remarkable period of growth for each one of us. We look forward to safely gathering soon.‚Äù

ABR is a non-profit firm which has been the subject of criminal referrals from House and Senate committees investigating whether Planned Parenthood or any other entity was illegally profiting from the handling of fetal tissue from aborted babies.
‚ÄúThese documents are a horror show:::‚Äù said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton. ‚ÄúThese records show that the FDA was trafficking in human fetal parts. Incredibly::: there continues to be a push to reopen these monstrous experiments!‚Äù

"At the request of President Kevin J Worthen and under the direction of Academic Vice President Shane Reese::: last week a committee was appointed to examine issues of race and inequality at BYU and provide recommendations to the university about specific actions to address these issues. The committee will meet for the first time this week.

The committee will first prioritize opportunities to better listen to::: and better understand::: the experiences of black students::: faculty and staff on campus to help inform adjustments and changes that can assist BYU in being a more safe and welcoming place for BYU‚Äôs community members of color.

The committee takes seriously the charge issued by President Russell M. Nelson and leaders of the NAACP:

‚ÄúWe likewise call on government::: business::: and educational leaders at every level to review processes::: laws::: and organizational attitudes regarding racism and root them out once and for all. It is past time for every one of us to elevate our conversations above divisive and polarizing rhetoric. Treating others with respect matters. Treating each other as sons and daughters of God matters.‚Äù

Along with President Nelson‚Äôs encouragement on social media to:

- Foster our faith in the Fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man.
- Foster a fundamental respect for the human dignity of every human soul::: regardless of their color::: creed or cause.
- Work tirelessly to build bridges of understanding rather than creating walls of segregation.

Beyond this committee::: many other members of our BYU community will be utilized in assisting in this work. Of particular importance will be the voice of BYU students.

The committee is eager to get started::: and will immediately commence its work by reaching out to many students and members of the BYU community::: ready to listen.",6/18/2020 17:04,"One final thought as stakeholders move forward: let's consider what it means to ""care""-\-\why do we ""care about"" these issues related to race and inequality? Are we simply responding to external pressures? Do we care enough to be bold in our actions? And pressing forward::: how do we show that we ""care for"" one another as members of the body of Christ?","I love that you want to address inequality::: and this is a great step in the right direction!üíô But inequality cannot be fully addressed without including someone with a disability in the conversation::: too.

If you‚Äôre purely focusing on racism::: then you should be more clear with the committee title. Because the disabled experience inequality::: too.

Celebrate our ancestral cultures where appropriate::: but be united in all things.,If someone ask me what I am::: I‚Äôm gonna tell them that I‚Äôm Mandalorian.,One positive from this announcement already is that it shines the spotlight on BYU's Multicultural Student Services. It often feels like the special education classroom in a portable building separate from the rest of the school...,"I‚Äôm very happy to hear this. I hope that the committee and those receiving their recommendations
can be open minded and have the courage to make real changes.",Thank you!!!,Please consider changing the name of the school. There are many::: many great people in church history who are not heavily associated with racism. Name BYU after someone else,"Liked ""Of particular importance will be the voice of BYU students."" The BYU student body looks forward to understanding how our voices will be heard. Importantly::: how will our voices::: especially the voices of those who feel marginalized::: be incorporated into change?",Today::: I am actually proud to be a cougar.,Shouldn't this have already been a priority a long time ago!?,"BYU GREAT START FOR CHANGE!

I am not one to post strong opinions on social media like this. Nevertheless::: I felt a very strong need to do so as it is something that is so near and dear to my heart. I would::: however::: like to preface this by saying that it is not my intention to tarnish the name of BYU in any way::: because I am in fact a very proud graduate of Brigham Young University.

Believe me::: there are many great lessons and experiences that BYU and the people that I met here brought into my life. However::: there is an undeniable::: unfortunate truth that accompanied me throughout my time at BYU and that is a constant feeling of inadequacy rooted in my not being part of the majority (i.e.::: a Caucasian student).

Looking back::: I should‚Äôve been more involved in BYUSA and activities::: but I wasn‚Äôt. Why? Because I never felt I belonged or that my opinion would be valued the same as that of my Caucasian peers. The truth is there is strength in numbers. Assuming that BYUSA membership is an accurate representation of the ethnic demographics of the university::: that would mean my opinion as a minority student would be 81% more likely to be outvoted by my peers.

I think that multicultural student should be encouraged to take part in student body leadership. How::: you may ask? By demonstrating and fostering a welcoming atmosphere towards other cultures::: backgrounds::: opinions::: experiences::: and languages.

I propose two small actionable items that can demonstrate additional desire for change:

1. Move the BYU Multicultural and International offices #outofthebasemen
t floor and unto the same level as BYUSA. This will help prevent multicultural students from feeling they are not on the same level as their Caucasian peers.

2. Have BYUSA promote and engage in the multicultural activities organized by Multicultural Student Service and International Service Offices. (Once::: I asked if I could leave some flyers for a Multicultural Student Services event::: a university sponsored event::: an event supported by the Dean::: and I was told NO::: because they only promoted BYUSA events.)

Riddle me this: are we not on the same team? are we not on the same level?

Let‚Äôs continue towards Becoming One.",I am happy to see Lita Little Giddins‚Äô name on that list. She is filled with experience::: wisdom::: talent and love.,Fatherhood of God and brotherhood of man is certainly accurate but has an unpleasant Victorian history. And how about changing the school's name to Eliza Snow University. How about some statues of female leaders?,There is always a concern that the representation of diverse voices from an institution becomes an exercise in tokenism. The selection must be judicious to avoid that appearance. I doubt not that the members are up to the task but must be wary of any power dynamics that will hamper the efforts of fulfilling the objectives delineated::: first::: to listen and understand and::: then::: enact change.,Is it just black students? There are other skin colors there.,Where are the accountants on the committee? LOL,I like the NAACP mission statement and history. I became a member. I google for the BLM creed and was grieved to read the anti-family stance.,I hope they don't even consider changing the name of BYU. I remember wonderful times there with people of many races and cultures. I love that so many languages are spoken on campus. I love the spiritual atmosphere and the great musical performances. Please don't change what is so good.,In some cases::: it takes a crisis to recognize and meet the challenges of the past and present (e.g.::: institutional racism). Beyond it being a reactionary move as some may construed it to be::: I hope this is more than that.,Just as long as us other minorities also are thought of::: then great!,I suggest you go to a different school if you don‚Äôt like it.,I hope BYU does make a drastic move of racism. Back in the 50's some of our students from our home town of Laie in including my sister did confront racism from kids within the area they were living in Provo.,Thank you!! This is great news.,And y is it always a black and white issue? This could be good but mostly ur going with group think.,How can we contact the committee to voice our opinions?,This is great news! I‚Äôm excited to see more progress,"""Only the gospel will save the world from the calamity of its own self-destructio
n. Only the gospel will unite men of all races and nationalities in peace. Only the gospel will bring joy::: happiness::: and salvation to the human family.""

BYU is in good hands with its leaders. It is important that each individual comes together and becomes unified in the gospel. As those leaders do so::: I do not see a problem coming forward out of decisions made. What a wonderful blessing it is to have our Heavenly Father's trust to be sent here at this time!",What about discussions related to the experience of other minoritized groups including Latino students?,I hope BYU stays strong and does not rename buildings or take down any statues. They are our history. Cancel culture needs to stop.,"This kind of thinking is not in keeping with the church....I hope that they will reconsider and not cave to the chaos that is happening around us. There are obviously some areas where improvement should be made(more of a matter of personal accountability)
::: but consideration of restructuring::: renaming::: and delving into those kind of changes that ""the world "" is demanding::: is not who we are. We need to get back to the principle of being in but not of the world::: and remembering who we are at all times. No where in either of the quotes listed does it say that jumping into name changing::: or any other ""history changing"" activities::: or policies::: are included. If a toe hold is given in this part::: then there is no stopping it from going into other areas....if that happens::: we are done.",Good work üëç,This is a great step::: but it is long overdue. Having a global institution with tens of thousands of students and employees but not having a dedicated team of leaders to advocate for their needs until 2020 (and only after allegations of racism and prejudice) is unacceptable. It wasn't a secret that minority students were struggling at the school before now...why did it take national protests for the campus to decide that it needed to change? And how long will any actual change take? Is this committee just a PR measure? I hate to sound so negative::: but when it comes to racism and students of color::: BYU has taught me not to hold my breath.,Ban the display of the confederate flag on campus::: including dorm rooms.,This is wonderful news and as a BYU alumna I am thrilled. Can we please instead have a focus on fostering our faith in the Parenthood of God and the kinship of humankind? Language matters. Please stop excluding women in your language. As you seek to embrace the black students on BYU campus who suffer more than they should::: why not get on with doing the same for women? Also‚Äînot trying to make this about women. This is about black students. It just seems utterly ironic to me to be posting about something so necessary for inclusion of a historically and currently excluded group while simultaneously using language that is exclusionary toward another group of people who are historically and currently excluded.,A large portion of non-white students at BYU are international students::: who often come from low-income families in developing countries and who struggle financially through college at a much::: much higher rate than their American counterparts. And at least while I was there::: BYU's attitude towards us was very unhelpful. For example: the vast majority of financial aid was based on your GPA::: as if students who have to work to put themselves through college can really compete for grades against students who get all their expenses paid for by their parents. So a good first step would be to recognize that BYU should have more income-based financial aid::: especially for international students who cannot apply for US government grants and loans. If you are serious about decreasing racial inequality::: put your money where your mouth is.,It‚Äôs the right think to do. To bad Yoeli isn‚Äôt available.,It‚Äôs not the first time BYU has been through an investigation. During the 1969-70 year the same thing happened,Great step. Put people of color in leadership positions if you want to have equality. In the honor code office too so they can see things from different angles. Five years studying::: and I never been more than just an FHE guy or activities committee while I used to be in the leadership position in my own country. I‚Äôm not saying I want one at all::: and not looking for it::: but that will be a great start.,I'll believe it when I see it tbh. And when we get the name changed away from one of the most racist people in the church's history...,Great news::: can we start with renaming the Abraham Smoot Administration building?,How can I follow the findings and progress of this committee?,When will you change the name of your school? Young believed in the Curse of Cain::: after all.,I really hope they make some big changes.,This is great news::: and I really hope they're the right steps to help improve the racial disparity that occurs on campus. It's heartbreaking to hear of how black students have encountered insensitive remarks::: and I know that BYU can do a better job of fostering a safe environment for everyone regardless of skin color.,"In recent days::: I noticed how what is detailed below has become a significant point for growth among us as many in society have engaged in virtue signaling::: or publicly patting themselves on the back for being good to others of a different race:

""Feel proud of yourself when you behave well toward someone of another race.""

It is expressly noted in the article that this pattern of behavior should be specifically avoided in our ongoing pursuance of Christlike nature. When we feel we deserve to congratulate ourselves publicly or privately every time we treat someone of a different race with dignity::: we are engaging in a very real form of racist behavior. In reality::: we should be treating everyone everyday with love and kindness naturally and normally independent and irrespective of the race that child of God belongs to.

It looks like the committee is currently made up of only faculty and staff.,i would really love to go to BYU but i know its super hard to be accepted there,Do you mean follow the guidelines the Savior set?,Step one: change the name of the university. And yes I am an alumni.,This procedure should apply to all races.,This is exciting. As apart of educating the student body I would hope that this committee will look closely at the black lives matter group and the website they run and educate the student body on what that group stands for. As an alumni I believe all people need to be treated with respect but the messaging behind this blm group is very detrimental to society and I would hope as a committee will distance themselves from the group . (If anything please read what the blm is about from their website ),At BYU::: there is some systemic racism toward all minority students::: not just blacks. Please include Asians::: Native Americans::: Hispanics::: Filipinos and Polynesians in your discussions. I suspect you‚Äôll be shocked to learn about the racial issues these students have experienced at BYU and Utah in general. You are going to have to acknowledge and confront the teachings of President Kimball vs the teachings of modern day church leaders regarding interracial marriages because this conflict is partly to blame for the way minorities are treated within BYU‚Äôs religious community::: particularly when it comes to dating relationships.,"BYU is considered today an equal employment opportunity employer yet for decades administrative:::
staff::: faculty::: and certain student jobs has been predominately and disproportionat
ely held by Caucasian::: the MTC hires through BYU as well and is also predominately and disproportionat
ely Caucasian in staff::: administrative:::
and certain student jobs where policy and organizational attitudes are created and shaped. Group think and exclusion has existed as a result. Independent of the fact that BYU is predominately Caucasian the hiring process must be more inclusive of minority groups::: such as the black student body::: in considering and hiring them in administrative:::
faculty::: and staff positions where organizational attitudes::: culture:::policy and processes are created and shaped. What specific actions will you the Committee recommend to address and begin to change this from top to bottom in order for BYU to truly reflect a more equal employment opportunity practice and culture? Adam Bouka::: Ashley Poelman McLain Andra Johnson Courage Tamakloe",I think white people are not getting their fair share that it for dang sure.,"BYU
If you‚Äôre worried about ‚Äúequality‚Äù and about people‚Äôs feelings not getting hurt::: people not being left out::: or people being offended::: then you oughta consider the gays too...",But must we all hate yt?,This is wonderful! And some of the comments here illustrate how necessary this really is!,So sad to see my beloved BYU caught up in this muck. Might as well put up posters BLM. SMH,"Just some ideas:
1. Add a required cultural awareness gen ed
2. Make racist acts or comments explicitly against the honor code and punishable by the university
3. Ban racist symbols from campus (swastikas::: confederate flags::: etc)
4. Rename buildings named after racist people
5. Hire more BIPOC professors and staff::: have them high positions and in the university management","Maybe moving the Multicultural and International Student Offices to a more prominent::: visible::: accesible location could be a start. They're literally in a corner of the basement of the Wilkinson Center (at least they were there 4yrs ago when I graduated). Maybe incorporate mandatory GE credits on diversity and inclusion. Maybe audit and monitor scholarship and grant allocation to ensure fair allocation removing bias based on race or national origin-\-\or even better::: accounting for those proactively. There is so much more that can be done. Remove barriers that go counter to greater diversity and inclusion-\-\like
outrageous admission deposits put in a 0% escrow account that international students need to pay to be admitted that end up keeping BYU out of reach of less-privileged
international candidates. Empower minorities. Trust them. They are not dumb. They are smart. And they are brave-\-\after all they chose BYU::: despite what that entails for a minority student. You don't have the luxury of having many of them in numbers. As they're in short supply::: they are precious; they are an undervalued stock that does not shine as it should. I hope this committee does not end up being a symbolic move and that some tangible actions come out of it.","I hope you also reach out to faculty you've lost to ask about the impact of racist academia practices at BYU

Marguerite Dreissen comes to mind",Maybe a woman president for BYU? That could start things too.,Affirmative action is racist::: so don't go that route,"Have more Latinos::: Asians::: and Blacks::: and Native Americans on campus.

Make it more international like BYU-Hawaii.","Brigham Young was a racist. The church before 1978 was thick and ripe with racist teachings. It wasn't until lawsuits emerged that in 1978 they became inclusive to POC.

Brigham Young was and always will be a racist.",Make sure you include white voices. Too often counsels like this devolve into white criticism and handouts for minorities (and white liberals indoctrinated to criticize whites are not a white voice). Whites also face racism in the form of racial abuse- treating whites like racists. And race and ethnic studies classes at BYU are built on white criticism and ignore white voices and racism and violence whites face. I took graduate courses at BYU::: I know from experience. Judging from this list::: looks like you have no whites who recognize racism and violence towards white people.,How about starting by changing the name of the Abraham O. Smoot Building.

"A message from President Worthen:

With the tragic deaths of George Floyd::: Breonna Taylor::: Ahmaud Arbery and others over the years::: and the confluence of recent events::: important conversations are happening throughout the nation::: including at BYU.

We extend our love and concern to all members of our university community who are impacted by these events.

We know there is work to do::: on campus and throughout the nation::: for us to better come together::: to address injustice and to truly love one another. It will take sustained effort from all of us to make things better. We remain committed to doing that. We can do that in a unique way at BYU because of our understanding of the important truth that each of us are children of heavenly parents.

BYU stands firmly against racism and violence in any form and is committed to promoting a culture of safety::: kindness::: respect and love.

As we continue to move forward together::: let us do so with charity. Let us be kind. Let us respect others. Let us listen. Let us follow the example of Jesus Christ.",6/2/2020 22:09,"For those of you that don't believe that racism still exists in America or that it isn't a big deal::: please read this man's story with an open mind.

A call to action with no action doesn't mean much,Jasmine from the First Name Basis podcast says talking about race is a muscle you build up over time. I'm currently in a business ethics class at BYU and we talk about how everybody at BYU wants to be ethical::: but we have to practice talking about ethics and specific ethical scenarios in order to be prepared for when those moments come.

I know many will disagree with me and that's fine. What I think is not fine is viciously attacking others and citing personal liberty or any other reason as the justification. Can't we disagree with others without attacking them? How can we say we are following Jesus Christ when we are being contentious or not doing to others what we would want them to do to us?

Sometimes::: having the right balance of restrictions provides us with the most freedom.

This pandemic is practically harmless to children::: flu-level threat to teens and young adults::: and only a major issue for the elderly::: the smokers::: and the generally immuno compromised.

It‚Äôs no skin off my (young adult) teeth to wash my hands an extra few seconds::: stand away from others::: and not help the elderly get a large jug of salsa off the top shelf at the grocery store.
The high risk group::: and those living/
interacting with them::: will need to be extra precautious when going out. They need the masks::: constant sanitization::: and to replace gloves as they transition to a new surface/
location.

It‚Äôs not a loss of freedom to let cars and school kids cross at a 4-way stop sign instead of charging through::: or to come to a full stop even when the intersection is clear. It shouldn‚Äôt be a loss of freedom to act defensively as the quarantine loosens its restrictions.","What does it cost you to wear a mask? If you equate being 'asked' to wear a mask with oppression then you might not have much experience with oppression.

Are road rules and public decency laws also signs of oppression? We follow the rules in respect of each other.

In the hospital::: we are trained and fitted for N95s. Masks are single use::: per interaction. People are running errands all over town::: touching their masks::: wearing them with one strap off::: visible gaps. There is no solid data to back daily use of masks by the general public. Try opening a Splenda packet with a mask on if you want an eye opening experience.

I hate that people are judgmental when someone doesn‚Äôt wear one. Maybe they can‚Äôt! You don‚Äôt know!

That‚Äôs what I hate is people being judgmental and you dont know their situation.,"I‚Äôm trying to do some research using only open sources. Has BYU done any studies to determine the true risk of asymptomatic transmission of any respiratory virus?

I recently found a few studies claiming they monitored asymptomatic cases. However::: they only used nasal swabs. That is only a screening test that confirms exposure but not necessarily infection. It definitely didn‚Äôt confirm that viruses were being emitted.

I‚Äôm looking for a study that captured the breathing of asymptomatic subjects and analyzed how many viral particles were emitted.","Miss Sloan::: if you are truly concerned about liberty::: trust that there are things afoot in the world that will help you and others lose your liberties.
Mask wearing MAY help in some cases of extreme exposure and confined spaces. However::: the garden variety masks we see daily are not adequate for anything but the most rudimentary tasks::: and not worth the paper they are made of.
Perhaps the larger concern here is behavior modification::: like Pavlov's dogs. Combine this with draconian measures to isolate the ""non sick"" and scare them daily with lies and false reporting::: and WE become the ones being conditioned. Conditioned for control. For manipulation. For subjects of those who would exercise unrighteous dominion.
We are alive today because our Wonderful Creator designed us to be adaptive and self maintaining.

Many cultures like ours wear special clothing as a reminder of the first great commandment to love God with all their hearts. In a pandemic::: wearing a mask is a way of following the 2nd great commandment to love our neighbors.

Sommerfeld ‚Äúfor YOUR safety‚Äùü§£,Its truly amazing to see an institution that honors the American Revolution but would never have participated in fighting for freedom itself.

It is about compliance.,Just an opinion. A lot of the LDS world would disagree. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,Interesting that BYU is sharing an opinion article from Deseret news. An article that supposes that if some model suggests less people can get sick by wearing a mask that we should do so. Well by that reasoning we should always wear a mask for the rest of time. As more data comes in::: it seems that the CDC shouldn't have ever declared covid-19 a pandemic. An epidemic yes::: but not a pandemic. When it was new and we didn't know what could happen it was right to be careful. But now we know that it's not much different than any other illness. The older::: more frail::: and those with weaker immune systems are more susceptible and are hit harder. This is the same for just about any virus or infection. If the flu is not a pandemic::: then covid-19 shouldn't be considered one any longer in my opinion.,"Exactly! The western world secured democracy during WWII because they sacrificed greatly in terms of lives lost and a whole generation who suffered through the economic results during and after the war.

The same thing is happening today::: only that it is far worse - we cannot actually see the enemy! Wearing a mask is such a small gesture::: no one is asking you to potentially kill yourself in combat. But you sure can kill someone else in case you infect them unknowingly.

We seem to make big speeches about how we would do anything for someone we love. Well::: step up and do that right thing. Everyone in this world has someone they love or loves them.",I love this.

"New 2020 The Wall Street Journal ranking: BYU is No. 1Ô∏è‚É£ in the west::: and No. 4Ô∏è‚É£ in the nation::: for student engagement. üéâ

To address the first 10 or so comments we typically see when talking about this metric::: this ranking is NOT about engagements to be married. We fully understand BYU would be at the top of such a ranking as well. Feel free to still make your engagement-related joke in the comment section::: if you'd like::: but the reality of this ranking is actually pretty important and valuable as you look at what it means for the holistic BYU experience.

For the WSJ's purposes in this ranking::: ""student engagement"" is defined as how connected students feel to their school::: each other and the outside world.

So ‚Ä¶ in a time when we‚Äôre all more physically-separated than ever::: we‚Äôre fortunate to still be a part of a BYU community where individuals feel much more connected than most.

From President Worthen:

‚ÄúYou students have the rare opportunity to be part of ‚Ä¶ a compact society that God has prepared to help you learn and develop Christlike attributes. You are not here by accident. You have been gathered here by God. Whatever your background::: whatever your talents::: whatever your challenges or perceived weaknesses::: you are a vital part of this gathering. You have something to gain from and something to offer in your interactions with those around you.

May each of you recognize and delight in the blessings of being fully engaged in this unique kind of gathering ‚Äòof learners and lifters‚Äô is my prayer.‚Äù

COVID killed half a million people (perhaps half that when all the false attributions are filtered out down the road)::: virtually all of which were the same people who are killed each and every year by the garden variety flu::: and which was substantially exacerbated by the lockdowns::: mass quarantining (especially of nursing homes and assisted living facilities etc.) and short-circuitin
g of natural herd immunity.

Let's get this straight: COVID did not ""turn our lives upside down;"" that was accomplished by the mainstream media::: politicians and bureaucrats at the state::: municipal and federal levels.

judge-connors","COVID - 19 turns one's life upside down because they allow it to. Just like BYU mandating masks. The data is very clear when it comes to the ineffectiveness
of cloth and surgical masks. Many studies were done during the height of the pandemic that supposedly proved they worked. The problem with these studies is that none of them were conducted under conditions of a randomized controlled trial::: which has been recognized by scientists & physicians for 50+ years as the gold standard of scientific testing. In these trials::: researchers recruit people and split them into evenly matched groups. They offer one group a certain treatment and another group no treatment. This way when they test for the outcome they have a control group to measure against.

Pre-Covid::: a total of ten ""gold standard""::: randomized controlled tests were done for medical masks. All of them came to the same conclusion... they don't work::: unless you are wearing an N95 mask::: sealed & fitted to your beardless face::: and only then if the wearer is trained on how to use it. All of these studies showed very low effective rates for surgical masks and next to zero effectiveness for cloth masks. You can see the data and the summary of these 10 studies here: https://
wwwnc.cdc.gov/
eid/article/26/
5/
19-0994_article. The medical and science community did not see the need to invest further research funding into doing subsequent tests from that point forward because the results were so conclusive.

Post Covid::: only one randomized controlled test has been conducted on masks (to my knowledge) and was conducted specifically to examine whether masks protected their wearers from the Coronavirus. It was a study out of Denmark published in November of 2020. The results were the same as previous tests::: in that mask wearing ""did not reduce::: at conventional levels of statistical significance::: the incidence of Sars-Cov-2 infection"". See that study here: https://
www.acpjournals.
org/doi/
10.7326/M20-6817.

To this day::: even the World Health Organization says the evidence of mask efficacy is underwhelming: https://

Unless future::: large randomized controlled trials find different results::: the Danish mask study::: matched with its predecessors::: essentially should end the debate of whether surgical masks protect people who wear them outside hospitals (much less cloth masks). As physicians and infectious disease professionals largely agreed until April of 2020 (suspiciously):::
the answer is THAT THEY DON'T WORK. Anyone who says otherwise::: for whatever reason::: is ignorant::: too lazy to research the truth on their own (or both)::: caving to social pressure::: or purposely being untruthful.","Hey friends. this Kindle gives very good service. you can use it.

"What happens when women are outnumbered? After years spent analyzing lab and real-life settings to determine what it takes for a woman to really be heard‚Äîto truly be perceived as competent and influential‚Äîa trio of BYU professors have found the same truth: for women::: having a seat at the table does not mean having a voice.

‚ÄúWomen are systematically seen as less authoritative:::‚Äù says BYU Political Science Jessica Preece. ‚ÄúAnd their influence is systematically lower. And they‚Äôre speaking less. And when they‚Äôre speaking up::: they‚Äôre not being listened to as much::: and they are being interrupted more.‚Äù

But there are changes we can make to help women speak up and be listened to more.

When Women Don‚Äôt Speak",4/30/2020 19:55,Samantha Pentz Sandstrom,One thing left out in this study though it was ever so gently touched on: it is my experience that women often make decisions or respond based on not hurting feelings::: being sensitive to the repercussion::: even when doing so conflicts with the facts. When the conclusion that 2+3=5 hurts feelings::: a woman will much more likely than man go with not hurting feelings. Yeah::: with mom's children that might be the right approach::: but outside of that setting::: do that and you lose your credibility and confidence of others and become a deficit.,Rose Elizabeth Elbert,"Loved this. The biggest takeaway for me was the end: men assume they are useful contributors regardless of what groups they are in. And that actually makes them better contributors. Step into your power ladies and don't wait for invitations. Fear of being bossy or that other b-word::: actually make you a worse team member. An epiphany.

Also I have always thought unanimous decisions were way too much work::: I need to reassess.",Feedlot,Yes. Do you think men will read this? üòúüåπ,True just about everywhere.,"I remember some painful experiences as ward RS president:::when a sarcastic type brother was our HC ward rep::: and would make derogatory comments aimed at me::: as the only sister at our ward leadership meetings::: and no one in the bishopric said anything in my defense. I remember another meeting when YW and Primary presidents also attended and this brother attacked me again. The Primary president spoke right up::: and said::: Brothers are you letting him talk to her like that?"". I'm grateful now that all ward leadership meetings include all auxiliary presidents::: so no sister is by herself with only brothers.",Sometimes when we speak up we are not listened and very likely to be ignored in the church specially if we point out controversial issues ...,Rene√© Schlueter Amanda Bonney Claire Goodwin Jefferson Now we know what those studies we did were for haha,"Love this article!!
My daughter graduated three years ago with her masters of accountancy from BYU. She had a guy tell her straight to her face he didn‚Äôt want her in his group.
She graduated magna cum laude in the top 1% off her class. After graduation::: while working in the same city::: he credited her with helping him make it through the program.",Afton Izu Melissa Connor üòáüòá,I almost cried reading this. I‚Äôm so glad to have a real study that validates my feelings about this.,Abby::: thought you'd find this an interesting read!,Ann Robertson Groo- I found the article and I loved it. Thanks for the head's up.,So good.,"Sadly::: some of my worst experiences with this came as a graduate student in the college of Humanities at BYU. I once heard one of my male colleagues disparage some women in a graduate seminar as ""Turning it into a Relief Society Meeting."" #mansplainersEve
rywhere",Interesting read!,We don't have to be heard by everyone::: just by the people who need what we can give.,Instead of claiming that women are weak and being repressed how about produce research on effective methods of men and women working together despite differences? Oh but that would require ACTUAL RESEARCH WITH ACTUAL RESULTS::: heaven forbid our great professors produce useful things.,"I love how this paper is being paraded because it had the ""right"" conclusions. If it had said anything else it would have been tossed on the pile and forgotten. Classy BYU::: classy.",I mean its the same for men::: personality decides a lot at the table. This article said a lot about nothing. And if its the perception that women are less authoritative that we are talking about then thats mainly because an awful lot of women in business and authority tend to act like vixen and be overly difficult to work with.,Brooke McCauley Callahan,Mediocre white man: Yeah::: but here's an anecdotal story that invalidates your years of data and expertise.,Gissella Del Portillo Garcia Jessica P√©rez,"Love the article. I could say that I do strive for this between my wife & I::: as well as with my own daughter. I'm definitely not perfect at it though.

I agree with the fact that our society & culture is broken. There's a need for everyone in general to make changes. For us men::: the majority will need to learn how to listen with real intent to understand::: while also learning how to genuinely appreciate::: love::: & see the positives in others. There's more::: but I don't want to write a novel::: only a short story. üòú

For Women::: it does tend to be more outgoing and fearless::: but I also don't want them to simply forsake their God given talents for charity::: compassion::: tenderness::: etc... Women are absolutely essential to listen and counsel with.",How many general conference talks are by women?,How many mission presidents are women?,The study wasn't what I was expecting given the headline but predicable in any case. I thought someone might have taken on the very difficult question of what happens to other women as a result of women not speaking up about abusive men...i.e. other women end up getting abused.,How many women are on your board of directors?,"am I the only one that sees that in church settings women don't have the priesthood so that automatically puts their ""authority"" in 2nd place?",What a terrific article! It,How? I am a bishops wife and have pleaded for training as we get none::: and no one has listened. I know many bishops wives that would love training for the couple when they are called because there are men that know how to include their wife appropriately as in not sharing confidential things but asking their opinions on church activities for example etc... There are men that exclude their wives from every single thing. If there was training::: the couple would know how to handle the calling together. I feel like I have no voice as I have tried to explain this but it has been brushed off::: like it's of no importance. When a man is called to be a bishop::: it affects his entire family for 5 years. As of now::: we are expected to figure it out with no help. The first year was very tough. I am blessed with a good husband that values my ideas::: but have heard too many sisters in my position that are hurting and I would love to see a uniform training across every stake::: so that every couple does things consistently.,No one ever listens to me. üòÜ,Dallin Whitaker we were just talking about this.,Interesting. But doesn‚Äôt that happen with anyone put into a group of individuals different than they are? For instance::: one man in a team of women? How about one uneducated person in a group of scholars? One pencil pushers in a group of steel workers? Etc.,According to the article I can ignore this article. Lol,Amazing article!! I see this all the time in groups at BYU and elsewhere ::: but the groups I‚Äôve been in where I feel more comfortable (really many of my groups I‚Äôve been a part of in the finance program surprisingly enough) participating even if I am the minority have been amazing experiences for me.,It‚Äôs the culture!,This so so true in our stake. We have great spiritual priesthood leaders. Most are Hispanic which is a good thing in our area. However::: woman play little to no role in major decisions such as boundaries changes. Women know their place. It‚Äôs been frustrating to me for decades. I‚Äôve always supported the priesthood leaders::: but they are missing out on the nuances and wisdom of their sister leaders.,Fascinating article! Love Professor Karpowitz.,"I think the author is projecting their insecurities. I've attended a class that was filled with women. I was one of only two men in the class. I think the ""problem"" is 99% emotional. Also it isn't accurate. Women are far more expressive than men. It is men that are expected not to complain::: speak-up or agitate. For example there are 20 full-time lobbyists for breast cancer research. There are only 2 lobbyists for prostate cancer::: both are women::: both work only part time on the matter. If you actually look at the data::: men's lives are far worse than women's lives.",These are really insightful comments. I‚Äôll read this article carefully. I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll owe my wife a big apology.,I was recently trying to explain to my husband how different the talking dynamic is between Sunday school and RS. In Sunday school::: the men jump in immediately on every question and the women don‚Äôt chime in. I teach RS and I‚Äôve noticed that the women take more time to think on the question and their reply before they answer (meanwhile the men are off to the races). When I would try to participate in Sunday school::: I would raise my hand (I‚Äôm a teacher)::: but the men just shout out::: rapid fire::: one right after another::: and then the teacher moves on to the next question. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I‚Äôd guess 90-95% of the talking was from men and id guess the numbers in the room were about 40/60 favoring the men. I did notice a difference when the Sunday school teacher was female. The men raised their hands and the teacher waited more before calling on someone. She seemed to call on women about half of the time. More women raised their hands because she gave time before calling for responses. It‚Äôs all very interesting to watch and think about.,I loved this thank you,"Yes::: I have seen this happening in meetings I've been in and it has also happened directly to me in meetings I've been in.
‚ÄúWomen are systematically seen as less authoritative:::‚Äù
says BYU Political Science Jessica Preece. ‚ÄúAnd their influence is systematically lower. And they‚Äôre speaking less. And when they‚Äôre speaking up::: they‚Äôre not being listened to as much::: and they are being interrupted more.‚Äù",I have definitely experienced this in BYU classrooms::: at work::: on my mission::: and at church. I am forever grateful for the male BYU professors I had who not only welcomed women‚Äôs voices::: but demanded them.,I‚Äôm grateful for the female professors I‚Äôve had in my major! I appreciate all of my professors::: but it is so helpful to learn from their unique perspective on finding balance in life::: especially as most people in my major are female üòä,Excellent article!

‚û°Ô∏è ""There are always opportunities even in the bleakest of times.""

Alums who graduated during past recessions share advice to new 2020 grads",4/22/2020 16:17,Put your knowledge into practice::: continue preparing every day in what you are passionate about and will become essential for your company::: you will always have good opportunities for success ‚ù§Ô∏è,Garrett James,I graduated in the midst of the Great Recession. My first job was not what I expected and was not until a few months after graduation. Look for any opportunity to get in to your field. I started as a contractor through a temp agency as a chemist (degree in chemical engineering)::: a year later turned that in to a full time hire position (using my experience as a temp chemist to get a job as a full time engineer for the same process::: but on an industrial scale instead of a lab)::: and advanced steadily from there.,The degree might get you the interview::: but your ability to solve someone's problems gets you hired.,"From those of us who faced the Great Recession:
- Find out what needs to be done and become an expert in it.
- Make yourself invaluable to those in need of your expertise. Be willing to work harder and smarter than everyone else and be the one that gets the job done.
- Be willing to go down paths you didn‚Äôt plan on if that is where the need lies. Ex: my husband graduated in engineering and took a job in state corrections because that was what was hiring. He is now the payroll manager using skills he learned in his business classes.
- Be realistic about what you can tolerate on a day-to-day basis. Being stuck in a job that makes you miserable will hurt you and impair your ability to succeed. But also seize on your strengths and be willing to put in the hard work to advance. Ex: working in a call center was NOT for me! But working in the healthcare administration field fit my skills and talents quite well.",We had 3 kids in our family graduating from BYU this year.

"We‚Äôre not saying unlimited screen time is fine for kids::: but new research is showing that kids who‚Äôve grown up with the internet and more technology than others from previous generations are no less socially skilled.

I'd like to wait for new studies that include this last decade.",I think it would be interesting to see the effects long term - how do high school and college aged people interact socially after so many years of increased screen time? My goals in parenting are long-term. If my kid isn't reading by 8 years old::: I'm not worried because science says that children who learn to read at 11 and those who learn to read at 5 show now difference in literacy skills by the time they're 12. So I don't really care that there's no difference::: socially::: between a child who is regularly exposed to screen time and one who isn't::: I want to know what science says about adults who were regularly exposed to screen time as children vs those who weren't.,I wrote a paper while at BYU about how communication via technology (whether in realtime or delayed) opens up so many social avenues for populations who can otherwise struggle in that arena::: like Autistic folks! <3,You can definitely find a study to support whatever point of view you have. lol,This presumes talking in person is desirable.,Amanda Budgett Webb,"Not surprised really.

"In a new study::: researchers from BYU's public health department found that kids playing youth sports consume more calories in post-game snacks than they actually burn during their games.

NEWS.BYU.EDU
Study: Kids eat more calories in post-game snacks than they burn during the game",2/27/2020 17:56,Seriously::: skip the trip!,Duh. You can‚Äôt outwork poor nutrition. It‚Äôs also something most kids don‚Äôt need to worry about.,This is me after the gym üòÇüòÇü§°ü§°,Directions unclear: stopped playing sports to avoid eating the post game goodies.,They also get more trophies after the game than they earn during the game.,Actually::: it muscle was gained::: the calories burned overtime might even out.,So do I. It‚Äôs so easy to over eat after working out.,My 4 year old‚Äôs soccer team does summersaults and chases butterflies the entire game. Of course their cookies and Capri suns are more calories than that.,What happened to oranges and water?,I always hated post snack requirements. I wanted to just do cold water and fruit...,I just want to slow clap for the person who studied this phenomenon in the first place! Well done you!,This generation feeds their kids WAY TOO many snacks. Then they don‚Äôt eat the meals which have (or should) the nutrition. But the little snackies are so cute::: the mommies just can‚Äôt resist!!,After raising 4 kids I can tell you that kids do not needs snacks all the time. Everyone has gotten into the bad habit that when their kid is a bit hungry they need a snack. Reasons they don‚Äôt: 1) It is good for them to feel some hunger 2) it teaches patience 3) It teaches them to appreciate food when they get it. 4) It teaches them what kids throughout the world go through. Of course there are all kinds of exceptions to this and I certainly am not talking about starving your child but if they go hungry for 30 minutes that‚Äôs okay.,I could have told you that without a study....,Thank you. Many people on this thread must not realize the unhealthy habits we are teaching our kids with the usual snacks I‚Äôve seen served over and over after youth sports. This study is not about shaming kids for eating a snack::: it is teaching kids to have a good relationship with food and exercise. As a parent and a nurse::: I‚Äôve been horrified at the snacks offered my kids after youth sports. No one needs a bottle of Gatorade (full of sugar)::: Oreos::: or crackers and ‚Äúgummy fruit snacks‚Äù after a workout. I would try to bring water::: popcorn or fruit and I was the ‚Äúweird parent‚Äù. American culture needs to rethink what we are teaching our kids to eat. Childhood obesity is an epidemic.,"And it‚Äôs okay. Calories are a unit of energy::: not something to be feared.
Let‚Äôs not encourage food fear. It‚Äôs NEDA week. Check out some articles on Intuitive Eating instead!",For my daughter's soccer there were half time snacks and after game snacks. We had no snacks growing up. Not sure how it's come to this.,I‚Äôm a pediatric dentist and have coached many seasons of basketball::: soccer and flag football. I‚Äôm glad to see a study like this come out that supports what I‚Äôve been telling parents for a long time. Thank you!,"It seems like a lot of the comments are focused on the idea of restrictive eating and calorie counting and how that's detrimental to an approach to food in one's life. But I think just as much of the article is focused on replacing empty calories with more nutrient dense foods. That is important::: and not a toxic mindset::: especially in the world of athletics.

It also isn't saying ""never have snacks or sweet foods or enjoy higher-calorie treats."" But to have baked goods and sugary drinks at every sports game isn't exactly helpful or doing the kids a favor.

Also::: it's soooo important to teach good habits to children when they are younger so they don't have to fight for years to undo them in the future. It's so much easier to maintain a healthy weight and healthy habits than to make big changes to your life to lose weight or alter eating habits.",Because post game snacks used to be water and fruit and now they are Pinterest worthy robots built from granola bars::: Gatorade::: candy and junk. Water. The kids need water. Not a 20 ounce blue dyed Gatorade.,Whatever happened to water and orange slices like when I was a kid? I got parents angry with me when I didn‚Äôt provide a junk bag full of tons of snacks after a soccer game for my kid.,It's cause we count Billy who just stands half the game unless the ball hits him....,But that‚Äôs not necessarily a bad thing!? Depending on where calories are coming from... and how active kids are the test of the week...,And I consume more calories at dinner than I do watching TV afterwards.,Lol so? Not like they need to replenish their energy stores or anything üôÑ,"I have a coworker who struggled with eating disorders for many years and she expresses to me a lot how difficult it is to live in this world that preaches CALORIES and BURNING off what you EAT and losing weight. It‚Äôs a very toxic mentality to limit yourself what you eat based off what you burn/don‚Äôt burn - teaching this to kids at such a young age is just awful. The term ‚Äúcalories‚Äù is very vague here in the title - could be coming from spinach for all we know (which is healthy::: yes?). So this study is a bit frustrating to me since it‚Äôs very triggering in the eating disorder umbrella. People need to give their bodies food. Kids need to give their bodies food. It‚Äôs essential to their mental and physical wellbeing. Some may say ‚Äúpeople are just too sensitive about this - it‚Äôs just a silly study‚Äù but... we are all neighbors here struggling/
dealing with something so let‚Äôs put ourselves in their shoes for a moment üíï",I bet they ate more calories at dinner than they expended washing their hands beforehand::: too.,I get worried when I see kids more excited about a snack than a game. Can‚Äôt we get through any gathering without food being the point?,Well::: so what. I know that parents consume more calories during post-game brewsky binges.,So not surprised. I hate all the junk food the parents give out. And the quantity is ridiculous!,So what? You think kids play to lose weight?,That's because exercise::: while a good thing::: will never do much in the way of offsetting the calories you intake. üôÑ,Yay! Kids love the post game treats! That is at least half the reason why they like to play!,This completely ignores calories burned during practices::: after which kids don't get sugary snacks.,Not sure when orange slices turned into fruit snacks::: chips::: donuts and Gatorade::: but yeah::: the newfound post-game sugar consumption is a joke.,Interesting that during National Eating Disorder Awareness Week this is the article you decide to share. This article is biased::: the study has a relatively small sample size and missing so many other factors. I would be skeptical taking this study to heart and seek other studies and sources that are unbiased and have better research protocols.,Weird thing to do: play a game::: eat a snack then remain perfectly still and inactive the rest of the day. Sounds like kids.,why is this a supersize to anyone?,Growing kids need activities they love but also calories. If they‚Äôre facing obesity::: that‚Äôs a different issue.,I find it strange how many people are having issues with the study. Kids don't need that much sugar at all the different events they go too. Teaching them to eat healthy snacks instead of them learning to expect snacks that go over the daily recommended amount of sugar is a good thing. And sure::: kids are burning more calories throughout the day but I bet they are eating more sugar too.,So NOT getting McDonald's after playing soccer will help me stay fit? I think we need more research into this.,I can‚Äôt stand this trend of having to provide snack bags after the game. When I was a kid it was cut up orange quarters at half time. That‚Äôs it. Now everything has to be a big production.,This is interesting research::: but I think you have to be careful with how you're framing it. A few thoughts: 1. While I agree children should choose healthier snacks (fruit::: as suggested in the article)::: post workout is the best time to replenish glycogen stores::: which can be accomplished with simple carbohydrates. 2. I think it's dangerous to get kids and parents thinking about trying to burn more calories in exercise than they consume afterward. That could be a recipe for disordered eating in the future. Young children shouldn't be playing soccer to lose weight. 3. I'd be more concerned about the kids who AREN'T in the game‚Äîwho might not be developing a healthy sense of enjoyment about physical activity.,I'm still waiting for the study that shows that beards do not affect academic performance in any way.,So...are they not going to move the rest of the day? Kids are amazing intuitive eaters if us adults got out of the way and stopped micromanaging their appetites. So they eat a bit more after the soccer game. They will likely account for that increase in energy intake later in the day by moving more or eating less. Let them be kids.,we've been volunteering to coach city sports for almost 10 years now and I completely believe this!,"It is me. I am ""kids.""",Kids are growing::: they need the calories,Well::: that would also mean that as a parent::: I probably don't burn as many calories from watching them play as I thought‚Äîand I should probably stop stealing their Sunny D at halftime.,"Same with people and the gym. ""I just jogged for 3 miles. Now I need my 600 calorie post workout shake and bar.""",Eat more water,Melanie::: BYU has justified our hatred of post game meal-snacks.,Oranges.,So?,"1. It‚Äôs pretty sickening to calorie count CHILDREN
2. Snack Culture? It‚Äôs called being hungry
3. God forbid they EAT","Positive Nutrition with Paige Smathers::: RDN. -
We need expert weigh in on this... so damaging.",Robert Dale Smith another reason to stop snacks!,Trina Rush Burdge definitely true lololol,"As a therapist who specializes in treating individuals with eating disorders/
disordered eating::: I find so many problems here (both in the study and in the article published by BYU)::: it‚Äôs hard to know where to begin. Here goes::: in no particular order:

1. Just to get this one out of the way: ‚ÄúKids are getting inundated with snack culture all the time.‚Äù Snack culture?? A culture in which children eat snacks? And that‚Äôs a bad thing?

2. The ‚Äúfinding‚Äù looking at calories burned vs. calories eaten. Focusing on this finding perpetuates a huge issue that really DOES have negative impacts on health: the idea that movement is about earning or compensating for food. This idea is disordered. Whether or not the study was specifically trying to say that kids should consume the exact number of calories they burned (or fewer) to be healthy::: the fact that the study was using this metric to draw conclusions about the health of youth in sports is problematic.

3. This quote: ‚ÄúSo many kids are at games just to get their treat afterwards::: which really isn‚Äôt helping to develop healthy habits long term:::‚Äù Spruance said. ‚ÄúThe reward should be::: ‚ÄòI got to have fun::: I got to run around with my friend or score a goal.‚Äô‚Äù More problems here. First of all::: vilifying eating for pleasure is a slippery slope into more disordered ideas. If having ‚Äútreats‚Äù becomes a bad thing::: we‚Äôre introducing shame into a perfectly normal part of eating. Shame about eating can lead to disordered eating. Eating can be fun::: can be social::: can be pleasurable::: and still be ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù because food is not JUST fuel::: and health is not just about food or weight. Food is fuel::: and the type of fuel we give our bodies does matter::: but we are also built to enjoy eating for many purposes::: not just to balance energy expenditure. Furthermore::: having food be a fun part of playing sports does not detract from the other rewards of sports::: as the author seems to imply in this quote.

4. The whole design of the study (as well as its sample size) is problematic if it is being used to create interventions or recommendations
for youth sports. The study essentially took a tiny snapshot of a child‚Äôs activity levels and eating::: and concluded that there was a problem because kids ate more than the recommended daily intake of sugar::: plus an ‚Äúextra‚Äù 43 calories. This type of fragmented view is also an example of a perspective that is edging on disordered. Our bodies are resilient and flexible when it comes to eating. As has been recommended::: please see the research on intuitive eating. The books Anti-Diet::: by Christy Harrison::: and Intuitive Eating::: by Evelyn Tribole and Elyse Resch::: are great starting points. If we look at ANY tiny snapshot of a day and try to compare calories burned vs. calories eaten as a marker of health::: we won‚Äôt get the full picture. There is nothing wrong with inviting parents to bring a greater variety of foods to the post-game snack::: but there IS a problem with fear-mongering about food based on findings from tiny moments in the lives of a tiny sample size of kids.

Vilifying sugar::: vilifying ‚Äútreats:::‚Äù vilifying snacks::: reducing food to output vs. intake::: focusing on calories in both eating and exercise::: fear-mongering about obesity‚Ä¶ SO many problems here::: and many of them in the realm of disordered eating.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The power of positivity.

BYU researchers in the BYU McKay School of Education spent three years observing elementary school teachers::: in 151 classrooms::: in three different states. They found by praising::: instead of reprimanding::: teachers saw up to a 30 percent increase in students‚Äô focus in the classroom.

Soon the kids were looking for good things in everyone. Instead of tattling they would tell the teachers when they saw good things. And they began to praise each other.

"The road to adulthood‚Äîwhatever that means‚Äîhas never been longer. BYU researchers say a few things have changed dramatically in the last 25 years about how young people transition to adulthood. Today‚Äôs young adults are hitting traditional adult milestones (landing full-time jobs::: marrying::: having kids) later than any of their predecessors have.

Read more in the link below on what emerging adults can do to navigate this sometimes difficult period.

MAGAZINE.BYU.EDU
Why are young people struggling with adulthood?",12/20/2019 17:59,Look at the parents who raised them.,"I think it's more apt to say that people ""in Utah"" may be having trouble hitting the ""Utah adult milestones""::: namely getting married when you're 18 or 21::: having kids when you're 22::: and so forth. The rest of the world doesn't necessarily do things so quickly.

Here's the thing: not all of us wanted to ""treat our 20's as an adult playland"". I wanted to get married and have kids in my 20's. It was really frustrating to see everyone go on to this so called ""adulthood"". I didn't have my ""career"" until I was 31 when I became a Registered Nurse. I was trying to have a career doing other things but it wasn't panning out. But in my 30's::: I established a solid career::: found a great woman::: got married and started having kids. Now we also own a home.

But just because you are technically doing all the adult things now doesn't mean you can't do the things you loved as a kid. I still play guitar in a rock band.

Your life is YOUR life. It's not going to be the same as everyone else's. An adult is just a grown human. Just because you don't own a home or have kids or go to bed at 9 pm doesn't mean you are irresponsible or ""not an adult"".

Do what you want and life the life you want to. If you don't want to get married and have kids::: don't! It's a big sacrifice::: and you have to really want it.

Would I be sad if I didn't have my wife and kids? Yes::: it would be lonesome. But I hope I would look at the bright side of it all. I'd have more money and freedom to travel::: try different things::: move around.

Sometimes things work out to where you have the happy marriage::: kids::: house and all that. Sometimes it doesn't. I volunteered at a homeless shelter where I helped young families with 2-3 children::: just grateful to have a place to stay and some toast and coffee to eat for breakfast.

There is a good part of life that is beyond our control. Love and marriage don't always work out like we want them to. Maybe we need to be more willing to give people a chance. Maybe we have unrealistic expectations. Who knows? Just be honest with yourself::: what you want out of life::: and go get it.","Great ideas here. But I would also hope that the church (both the formal organization and the culture) would stop treating YSAs like kids. When I was in the RS president YSA ward at age 30::: we were required to have chaperones on an overnight temple trip to another city. When I asked if I could be on the of the chaperones::: I was told no::: *per the handbook*::: the chaperones had to be married people (and who ended up being younger than us...so basically sending the clear message that only married people were full adults who are able to control themselves.) I have many more examples like this from my experiences as a YSA all over the country.

If the church is serious about helping YSAs move into adulthood::: then there should be a greater effort especially in family wards to give YSAs greater responsibility by for example considering them for ""big"" callings and making sure their viewpoints and perspectives are considered and listened to. It can be very discouraging) and frankly alienating) to have responsibility and be trusted in worldly contexts like at work and then come to church and be told and treated as if you aren't a full adult and thus don't matter unless you get married.",Eleisha Oviatt This is by my human development professor. Looks interesting!,They finally got smarter than previous generations and realized there is no need to rush into the heavy burdens of life.,Colleges are offering an ‚Äúhow to adult‚Äù class because this is so common,I can commiserate,Emerging adulthood is good.,Interesting how this article does everything but explain why this ‚Äúemerging adulthood‚Äù is something to be avoided. It‚Äôs written from the perspective of older researchers who think their way of life was the only good way.,Interestingüòë,Everything is done for them . My kids all worked in high school . Every kid did . And you were responsible for your own health care at 18. When you got married you paid for your wedding. And college.,"The ease of the way. And I'm guilty of this. Carving out a life and carving out of yourself a better person is no job for wimps. But why do it when you don't have to?

We are blessed beyond measure. The common person has access to better food::: better transportation:::
finer things than all the kings of the earth up until the last century. Adulthood is a call to responsibility and its hard to not expect the world for doing nothing when that is how so many of us came into this life.

Props to every parent who makes work vital in all they are teaching their kids.",Monique Marie I haven‚Äôt had a chance to finish reading this. But it reminded me of our conversation this week!!!,Yes::: but they get to learn algebra in 3rd grade! üòÇ,"I wish anthropologists
could be more valuable to these kinds of researches. This is not just a psychological or sociological change::: it is cultural. Culture needs to be understood in all aspects of life to be able to understand this topic. What it means to be an adult? How adulthood was seen in the past? How it is seen today? The article kind of states that adulthood means to have a full time job::: married and kids. It is just a way of seeing things based on perspectives from the past. I think there is too much pressure on young adults. That‚Äôs the problem. In the past they had just one vision of things: life was to get married::: have kids and work. But now this globalized and multiculturalis
m world changes the way things are seen. So the transitions need to be well understood::: but again::: culture needs to be understood too. If you would ask me what adulthood is I would probably say: be responsible for your own actions::: put priorities first::: sacrifice your time::: money and talents in behalf of others::: make clear and reasonable decisions::: live a life to meet your professional goals (I would never say in order to be an adult have kids). So many different subcultures::: that‚Äôs why it is very complex to generalize a result. I am 29 years old::: 2 kids::: and sometimes I don‚Äôt feel I am a complete adult like my parents and their friends used to be in the past. So. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",Jill Ashby Binns GREAT read,I know for me::: it took a bit longer because of the push to finish my education and start a career. We got married after we both graduated and in the 6 years we have been married::: we have had to live with my spouse's parents twice. Housing costs way more than it used to::: higher education too. Plus having a healthy pregnancy and uncomplicated unmedicated birth for both my girls cost us a combined $7:::000 with insurance! Almost double what the insurance had told us. I don't know if we will have any more kids just based on the cost. In the neighborhood we live in::: it cost $80:::000 to build a home here in 1991. Houses are now being sold for almost $300:::000 for a home that is considered a first family home. School in my parents time could be paid by working in the summer. I worked the entire time just to pay rent::: car insurance::: and phone with not much left over besides a plane home for the holidays. Plus when my parents had kids::: I cost them a total of $100. So yes::: we waited because everything costs a ton. I recently tried going back to work::: but it wouldn't have been worth it because I'd be paying most of my paycheck to a babysitter. *Sigh*,Thanks Larry Nelson. Means more to me now that I've got teenagers. Finances are a huge part of this as you say. Also::: that dynamic where parents now try to delay their kids on marriage feels like a complete reversal from how things used to work.,I mean. Adulthood ain't what it cracked up to be anymore lol,Do y'all have a letter to the editor.,By the way. I hope someone who published this article read this.,Michael Rayback We‚Äôve discussed this a lot. Matthew Rayback,Adults have careers? Do you know how many 30 or 40 somrthings work at Wal-Mart. Either it is because they can't afford college::: college isn't for them or the way there lives just turned out. Do you think they consider that a career? Probably. But if you are an adult with a job you are doing good.,Plus do you know some cultures encourage adult children and parents to live together or live close by. This article is too Americanized,Have y'all ever though that one of the reasons why young adults are having a faith crisis because of this constant pressure to get married. Well at least LDS people I mean. Stop pressuring us. You are so annoying. That is what leads us into depression and low self-esteem. Come on now. This is what I am saying LDS people sometime live in a bubble. Maybe they should marry later for they can have time to get out of the bubble. No missions don't count.,Because some of our parents our poor. And only BYU will think young adults marrying in their late 20s and early 30s as a bad thing. Y'all need to stop pressuring young adults to get married.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"As a teacher in Oakland in the late 1990s::: Professor Ernest Morrell tried something different to get kids engaged.

He and another teacher introduced elements of pop culture such as rap songs into their classrooms as a way to engage the students with topics that kids know and care about. The goal was to start where they are and connect it to what they needed to learn.

Morrell transitioned from high school teacher to literacy education expert and his research on literacy methods is being used in classrooms in all 50 states: https://go.nd.edu/LiteracyAcrossAmericaWWYFF

"Teaching English at Oakland High in the late 1990s::: Ernest Morrell faced the age-old problem of how to get modern students interested in a canon of long-dead writers and poets. He watched kids muddle through class::: heads down::: interest limited. Then one day::: while teaching Beowulf::: a student’s eyes lit up when he realized the story was similar to a popular rap song. That day::: Professor Morrell saw a spark of joy::: enthusiasm and engagement and wondered how he could give that spark to all his students.

Since then::: Professor Morrell has authored K-5 and 6-12 curricula which are being taught by schools in every state. He’s advocated for teaching that not only improves academic outcomes::: but also personal and social ones. And he’s teaching Notre Dame undergraduates and ACE students to find that spark in their lives and the lives of those around them.

The Crown of the Blessed Virgin was originally intended to be placed atop the statue of the Virgin Mary on the Golden Dome::: but University officials made the decision to place it on display in the Basilica of the Sacred Heart when it arrived on campus in 1866 rather than expose it to the elements.

"During Jayme Hentig’s career as an Army medic::: he was comfortable caring for others every day. But in 2010::: he went from caregiver to patient after an accident sent his armored vehicle into a rollover. As he grappled with a traumatic brain injury and struggled to regain his cognitive abilities::: doctors eventually told him there were no more therapeutic options. But Jayme was undeterred and decided if there were no existing options::: he would create them.

After earning his undergraduate degree::: Jayme came to Notre Dame to pursue a doctorate in biology. Working with zebrafish::: he was able to better understand how and why brain cells regenerate. After graduation he will continue to study traumatic brain injuries in active-duty service members and veterans as a postdoctoral fellow at the National Institutes of Health.

I didn't care much::: I integrated relatively well with the regular students::: but in some ways and compared to other schools::: there was ample room for improvement so long as diversity and international support was concerned.

"In 2014::: Shawn Sexton ’88 was diagnosed with bulbar onset sporadic ALS. Realizing he would gradually lose his ability to walk::: communicate and eat::: he and his son::: John::: set out to create opportunities for independence. Together they designed EyeDrive::: an assistive technology that allows Shawn to adjust and drive his wheelchair using eye gaze technology. EyeDrive is one of three current solutions provided by John’s startup::: LifeDrive::: which also provides voice- and caregiver-controlled solutions.

John is now a junior at Notre Dame and a participant in the Grand Challenges Scholars Program::: which::: along with the IDEA Center::: has helped move LifeDrive from an at-home project to an expanded medical device company. John continues to lead its progress to commercialization and distribution::: and he hopes it will soon help other patients like his dad find more independence.

“To try and get this to patients by the time that we graduate is daunting and challenging::: but it pales in comparison to the needs of those patients that we’re trying to serve:::” John says. He explains that getting LifeDrive to patients is so important because not only does it give them technology and independence::: but it gives them hope. That hope::: he says::: can be life-giving.

"""We have done a lot::: but it is not enough::: not fast enough. We must act now. This is the Kairos moment.""

Earlier this month::: the Vatican and Notre Dame convened the third Vatican Dialogue on Energy Transition. The theme of this year’s discussion was “Just Transition:::” which focuses on the well-being of workers and communities that will bear an undue burden from the transition to a green economy.

Read more about the panel discussions: https://go.nd.edu/VaticanDialogue2021",9/14/2021 18:46,Notre Dame!!☘️☘️☘️,In the spring of 1959 a pipe on the third floor sink of George Hahn’s room sprung a leak and nearly drowned some guy sleeping in a first floor room right across from the front door. This is the only event at ND that is anywhere close to global warming that I know of. Check with Joe Mulligan.,We invite the Purdue Band to our house::: and then deny them the ability to showcase their band’s most notable symbol::: their Big Bass Drum. It’s like inviting a guest to your house::: then sitting down to have dinner with no place set for the guest. What’s the big deal about the tunnel? For years both teams and band’s used that tunnel::: so let the drum into the tunnel. I graduated ND in ‘68; back then ND had class. Wake up ND and show some class!,Enjoy the darkness 🤣,"Funny that you bring up Kairos…

Many::: many years ago::: I learned about the concept as a high school leader for our annual Flintridge Sacred Heart Kairos Retreat. We reflected upon the need to extend grace during times of crisis::: to embrace opportune moments for connection::: and to recognize critical moments where we are called to action.

Looking at the disconnection and isolation that has shrouded our world during almost two years of pandemic fear::: fighting::: and illness::: I respectfully suggest that the pettiness being shown in University of Notre Dame’s decision to forbid Purdue ""All-American"" Marching Band/Purdue University/Purdue Football from using the main tunnel for their drum on Saturday is an egregiously tone-deaf message to send the country about how we should be treating each other right now. It certainly doesn’t reflect Christian values.

I did not attend either Notre Dame or Purdue::: but rather spent my years at NU watching both teams trounce us on the football field (until that glorious September day in ‘95… but I digress). I will not be at the game on Saturday.

Some people I care very much about will::: however. James used to play that Big Drum for Purdue back in his day. His father::: Marty O'Hagan::: is a proud Notre Dame alumnus who turned the wall of his dining room into a showcase of his love for his alma mater when he retired and moved here from CA last year. On Saturday morning::: they will head to Indiana with James’s children to watch the teams they both love compete. It was supposed to be the first time the children would see that drum they’ve spent their lives hearing about in person— that it would happen on the pitch their grandfather has loved for most of his lifetime was going to make it all the more special.

But that’s just our story about what the drum means. The stadium will be full of countless others. There will be Purdue fans who have buried someone they loved this year::: fans who are struggling mightily with challenges we will never know::: band members who spent last season unable to play anywhere— Saturday is one of the closest days to normalcy these young people have had in 18 months. The list could go on.

So I ask you::: sincerely::: is the message that Notre Dame wants to send at this particular time of human suffering and exhaustion one of hope::: one of unity::: one of kindness… or do you really want to stand in front of the nation and let such a petty act sabotage your university’s character collateral?

I believe that this is a Kairos moment and that you are called upon to extend grace.

"""My hope and prayer is that we can learn from that experience 20 years later. That we can break down barriers::: recognize that often our divisions are not that significant::: and that we can pull together not only as part of a country but in a world that could be more unified.""

Rev. Edward A. ""Monk"" Malloy was president of Notre Dame on September 11::: 2001. He offered this reflection on that day prior to yesterday's Notre Dame Football game:",9/11/2021 20:27,Prayer is fine::: but until it works::: we cannot deny the need to defend our country from terrorists. - John O.,Wonderful thought Father. But until the Catholic Church straightens itself out it ain’t gonna happen. And this is quite evident at Notre Dame.,"I’ll copy what I left under your recent post about Kairos and climate change since it relates even more closely to your message here. Everything said in the message above directly contradicts the actions Notre Dame Stadium Notre Dame Football University of Notre Dame is taking against the Purdue Athletics Purdue ""All-American"" Marching Band on Saturday. It’s truly shocking.

How does refusing to allow use of a tunnel by young adults who have spent the better part of a year and a half quarantined— and whose family and friends are paying for seats in your stadium— break down barriers::: recognize the insignificance of divisions::: or show the world that we can be more unified by pulling together?

You’re only being asked to let some musicians share a tunnel for a few hours. To say no to such a simple thing as a Catholic institution modeled after Christ’s teachings is a terrible hypocrisy.
——————————————

Funny that you bring up Kairos…

Many::: many years ago::: I learned about the concept as a high school leader for our annual Flintridge Sacred Heart Kairos Retreat. We reflected upon the need to extend grace during times of crisis::: to embrace opportune moments for connection::: and to recognize critical moments where we are called to action.

Looking at the disconnection and isolation that has shrouded our world during almost two years of pandemic fear::: fighting::: and illness::: I respectfully suggest that the pettiness being shown in University of Notre Dame’s decision to forbid Purdue from using the main tunnel for their drum on Saturday is an egregiously tone-deaf message to send the country about how we should be treating each other right now. It certainly doesn’t reflect Christian values.

I did not attend either Notre Dame or Purdue::: but rather spent my years at NU watching both teams trounce us on the football field (until that glorious September day in ‘95… but I digress). I will not be at the game on Saturday.

Some people I care very much about will::: however. James used to play that Big Drum for Purdue back in his day. His father::: Marty O'Hagan::: is a proud Notre Dame alumnus who turned the wall of his dining room into a showcase of his love for his alma mater when he retired and moved here from CA last year. On Saturday morning::: they will head to Indiana with James’s children to watch the teams they both love compete. It was supposed to be the first time the children would see that drum they’ve spent their lives hearing about in person— that it would happen on the pitch their grandfather has loved for most of his lifetime was going to make it all the more special.

But that’s just our story about what the drum means. The stadium will be full of countless others. There will be Purdue fans who have buried someone they loved this year::: fans who are struggling mightily with challenges we will never know::: band members who spent last season unable to play anywhere— Saturday is one of the closest days to normalcy these young people have had in 18 months. The list could go on.

So I ask you::: sincerely::: is the message that Notre Dame wants to send at this particular time of human suffering and exhaustion one of hope::: one of unity::: one of kindness… or do you really want to stand in front of the nation and let such a petty act sabotage your university’s character collateral?

I believe that this is a Kairos moment and that you are called upon to extend grace.

Congratulations,☘️👍🏼,"As a concerned parent I’d urge reconsideration
of the no-masks policy as we are finding that with the Delta variant both the vaccinated & the unvaccinated carry the same (high) amount of virus when infected.
The CDC is recommending masks for ALL when indoors in areas of substantial & high community transmission.
St. Joseph’s County *is* in the “Substantial” category::: and is seeing rapidly-increas
ing cases each week.

Please also give thought to better air-flow/
filtration & social distancing. These are critical components of prevention.

He didn't go through with it... We were raised to respect people.. threat thy neighbor as you would treat yourself...

"In an effort to keep more entrepreneurs in the South Bend-Elkhart region::: the Judd Leighton Foundation is making a pool of $125:::000 available for Notre Dame student entrepreneurs who choose to stay in the South Bend area.

"For 125 years::: the Holy Cross brothers — and until 1936 some hardy religious sisters — worked on St. Joseph’s Farm to feed the students::: faculty and administration of Notre Dame. They finally stopped working the farm themselves in 1995 because there weren’t enough of them left who wanted to farm.

Blessings,We don’t need “police reform”. We need police officers who adhere to the strict training protocols of every police department in the US. We have more than enough laws to handle this which can readily be seen from the prosecution of Mr. Chauvin. We don’t need to overturn the policing of America because of an outlier like Chauvin. Instead::: we need to prosecute wrongdoing police officers and teach our children to comply with lawful orders of police officers and take their grievances in court. Teach our children to take ownership of their own actions. The “appalling cruelty” as reference by Fr. Jenkins is not indicative of the majority of police officers and instead is indicative of a very small minority of police officers. What hubris that Fr.

"70% of students have been or plan to be vaccinated.

If we can reach 90% by April 15::: we hope to relax some of our health protocols including allowing inter-hall visits in common lounges::: eliminating the mask requirement outdoors on campus for gatherings of 25 or less::: and restoring some outdoor recreational opportunities::: such as basketball and volleyball.

Help us get there:

- Upload your vaccination information to the UHS patient portal if you received a dose off campus. Use the document upload feature and choose ""Immunizations"" as the document type.

- Schedule an appointment using the link in the email from noreply@coronavirus.in.gov with subject line “You are eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine at your campus location.""",4/9/2021 19:11,J&J is clearly experiencing problems with theirs and that was the only one we’d have even considered for our son given the moral issues we have with the way the other two have been produced.,But have all questions about these vaccines been answered so quickly and yet with certitude? The US just suspended the use of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. I understand that ND is not giving that particular vaccine to students::: but that vaccine was also touted as absolutely safe.,Thank you comrades. I’m sure the students are grateful that basic rights might be reinstated. You realize there’s no science backing up any of these measures correct? Just arrogance and hypochondria.,"For those with moral concerns -\-\ Pope Francis has called coronavirus vaccination a life-saving::: ethical obligation::: and has described the refusal to get the vaccine as “suicidal.” He has backed his words with actions.

Both Pope Francis and Pope Benedict have received the Pfizer vaccine. Further::: Francis has mandated that all Vatican employees must be vaccinated. During Holy Week::: the Vatican provided 1:::200 doses of Pfizer to Rome’s poorest and most marginalized people.

At least as far as the church's top leadership is concerned::: Pfizer is fine::: and all are encouraged to be vaccinated.","Take your kids out and stop complaining....

To require someone to waive those protections as a condition for enrollment is appalling.,Very sad that the University made this decision.,"Go IRISH!!

forcing vaccination. Just unreal.",THANK YOU for keeping us safe ♥️☘️ the ones who are the angriest are always the loudest (although it affects them the least) but everyone I’ve talked to is so thankful that we are getting vaccinated. GO IRISH! Proud to be a student here today,"Can Father Jenkins see the future? How dare he announce that this vaccine is “completely safe.” Scientists aren’t even for sure how long this vaccine will be effective. It’s possible it would be needed every six months. They aren’t even sure! We aren’t just talking about a one-and-done vaccine::: this could mean potentially continually injecting the students over and over again. Can he guarantee these students aren’t going to have any fertility problems in the years to come because of this intrusive mandate? That they won’t end up having an organ issue or heart palpitations? There’s too much of the unknown here to force this upon your entire student body. As I’ve said before::: WHY is it ONLY a student decree? This is their home right now. Anyone invading their space should have to go through the same ""protections for the community"" if they are so forced: Professors::: clergy::: staff::: guests of mass or weddings or sporting events::: visitors to campus::: otherwise this virus can be passed on and on. Come on. It’s absolutely terrible to see so many suggesting these students just “go somewhere else” if they don’t like it. It’s not that easy. For one::: many schools are already finished with their admissions process for the upcoming fall. For another::: those who rely on student financial aid know that their best packages come as an incoming freshman who commits for 4 years. Switching schools now is devastating especially for those with limited financial resources. How villainous to leave these kids without a choice on a vaccine with such limited scope. And after they are already committed and engaged at their school::: that’s just wrong. And how dare Notre Dame decide this is a student ONLY intimidation? If it’s so darned wonderful and important for the community::: then the entire ND community::: or anyone coming onto that campus should be subject to the same senseless regulation. They won’t be::: because it’s exploratory::: and they know it. My heart goes out to the students in this predicament as well as their families. I suggest having a lawyer look into the plausibility of creating this experimental student ONLY regulation after their scholars are already enrolled and committed.","Yet they can't require an emergency use vaccine.

"Notre Dame will require students to be vaccinated for COVID-19 beginning with fall 2021 semester.

Details: https://go.nd.edu/COVID19VaccinationRequirement",4/7/2021 17:12,Super proud of Notre Dame for continuing to lead through this pandemic with such excellence in order to give its students a safe and meaningful college experience.,What a terrible and unethical decision. Guess we’re crossing ND off the potential list.,As a current student eager to protect my community and enjoy the rest of my college experience as normally as possible::: this makes me so happy.,"ND.....love ya::: I get staff wanting to be vaccinated and protected...I absolutely support scientific research::: I have received the vaccine. I supported my parents getting it.
Just...slow your roll. We need to at least have a year to know side effects in a few areas that are already touchy/
challenging for many uprising women and men...maybe take a pause here? Especially since this population isn’t necessarily a threat. Just a pause:::..not a never::: but a pause. I hate masks for my children::: I totally get staff wanting to feel safe::: but....this is a situation where a pause is appropriate.",Horrible!!! It just tells us how... uneducated and SHORT SIGHTED our educators truly are! There are many SMART doctors telling people NOT to get the shot... because they don’t know how it will affect people in the future at this point!,An outstanding decision by the University. Well done.,My daughter attended St. Marys of MN. Same requirements as I recall. I was glad that the school required the vaccinations.,Outstanding decision. Proud of my alma mater.,What's up with it not being required of faculty and staff- who depending on their age puts them at more risk for complications from Covid?,To quote Fr. Hesburgh::: “My basic principle is that you don’t make decisions because they are easy; you don’t make them because they are cheap; you don’t make them because they’re popular; you make them because they’re right.” It is right to love your neighbors and care about their health. As an alum::: I am proud of my alma mater as they continue to protect the community of faith at the university.,"I support their rules! Only those to comply get to come back- and experience all of ND life.
☘️👍☘️. A small price to pay to continue this education! 😀",That is fantastic!! Keep everyone safe and plenty of time for students to go else where if they don’t like! But I believe other university’s will follow the leader. I’m sure some university s will accept the non vaccinated! 💜,Very disappointed that you are mandating vaccination in order to attend classes. Bowing to fear and pressure.,The University continues to do things that embarrass me as an alum. Ironic that I have a science degree from ND and yet ND is ignoring the science and caving to politics.,I am thrilled that Notre Dame is making this decision. The fallout from the year-long+ closures are huge and long-reaching. In a communal setting::: having this requirement is so necessary. I just hope they don’t give waivers without documentation.,"Meningitis shots are required fir most high school and colleges so why not covid? I have no problem with this. If you needed a vaccine to take a trip to Africa let’s say .. there are quite a few needed especially if going to Ghana etc .. you’d get it for your trip.
Plus the new variants seem to be hitting that age group.
Vaccines work.. no one had research for small pox vaccine or polio in the same way they do now but look at the science! Even the chicken pox vaccine wasn’t a 100% gaurantee down the line. No vaccine can say there won’t be side effects and so on.. just add it to required needs for school! It’s a part of our life now! Get used it!",That is wrong on so many levels. Hope you loose lots of students. No one should be forced to be a lab rat. My husband went to Notre Dame years ago and now I have lost all respect for this school.,Constitution be damned::: I guess? Since when is a University in such a powerful position to dictate a person’s health choices? This is dangerous::: and I hope a lawsuit ensues.,Well DONE ND!! I’m thrilled about this. One of my daughters is getting her 1st dose of Pfizer at Butler University (also in Indy) tomorrow and my other collegiate daughter is getting hers (also Pfizer) on Friday at Dension U (in Ohio)! Finally some light at the end of this long dark tunnel 💪🏻😊,"""The University currently requires enrolled students to be immunized for hepatitis B::: meningitis::: measles::: mumps::: rubella::: tetanus and chicken pox::: and last fall required all students to receive the flu vaccine::: again with medical and religious exemptions."" Adding Covid to the list is no big deal. Especially since ND is offering to vaccine every current student in the next week and again in 3 weeks for the 2nd shot. There are millions::: maybe billions::: of people all across the world who would love the opportunity to get as easily vaccinated as our students are getting.",When I went to college::: I had to show records of vaccinations for all required. What difference is this? We're fighting a pandemic that has killed more people than any other pandemic or war and we have a vaccine that appears to give us hope to halt this pandemic::: but it's not as important as the other required vaccinations to parents? Why? What kind of idiot lies are you believing? I'm laying my trust in science::: not lies about vaccines. If we don't all get on board we will not erradicate this virus.,The fact is Notre Dame is a private institution with free reign to require whatever they want. If you're upset about the vaccine there's a chance you're not interested in pursuing higher education anyway.,This is a wise business decision by a private business entity. Incoming students can::: and should::: make a prudential decision whether or not to matriculate.,Absolutely horrible! Have a senior daughter and I’m devastated!,This will allow the University to get back to normal life and that means Football and a full stadium and money for local businesses.,Wow...unreal. This should NEVER be a requirement. See ya ND...lost all respect for you after this decision 😓,Long term effects unknown. Impact to fertility unknown. It's unfair to require of students who have already started their attendance at ND. It's not really a choice::: it's being thrown out of school for choosing to not have an unproven medical procedure. 99++ survival rate with treatments available. Shameful.,I can tell with 99.99% certainty that the anti-vaxxers spouting off here definitely did NOT attend ND 🙄,What happened to::: “my body::: my choice?” Guess that went out the window...,I feel strongly that it’s too soon to MANDATE vaccines that are this new. The vaccines do not protect from getting a covid infection but lessen severity. This is a moral issue and could really negatively impact young healthy lives. Over 50K have reported adverse affects to the vaccines.,ND used to stand for something 💪 but the past few years they fall for everything⚓,You can fly on planes without being vaccinated. People have been attending college and not vaccinated. It should be a personal choice.,Students that have had it shouldn’t be required to get the vaccine. CDC admits that shot isn’t as good as immunity built from having Covid. Don’t think it should be required just suggested.,GO ND! Thank you for doing your part. Will people be required to show proof of vaccination to attend the football games in the fall?,It’s amazing how many people on here are complaining about “freedom of choice”::: but fail to realize their own ignorance and hypocrisy when the university exercises their “freedom of choice” 😑,My husband and I are both ND Alum in healthcare and were grateful 🙏 to be vaccinated several months ago. We are grateful 🙏 our parents are fully vaccinated. We are grateful that our siblings are close to being fully vaccinated. We wish that our young children had the opportunity. The vaccine critics are noisy::: yet I know the world becomes safer as more vaccines are administered around those I work with and/or love.,Vaccines are required for grade schools and high schools - why not colleges and universities?,Used to love NOTRE Dame. This is a sad day.,"What about those who have recovered from COVID19 and carry the antibody? They need a redundant vaccine as well?

This is clearly a well thought out policy. Good luck with the litigation that’s certain to follow. 😂",It seems many here don’t know that close to 600 million doses have been administered so far in the world with few side effects. I know 2 of the vaccines are mRNA::: which is a first::: but the third (the J&J vaccine) is the same technique used in the polio and other vaccines - an inactivated virus. Do you still see polio or smallpox patients? No::: we eradicated those diseases! If you are worried about the new technologies::: then use the old one::: get the J&J. The students have the option::: they just need to get one. This is just about not been selfish::: protect yourself and protect others! And maybe we eradicate COVID as well!,Well done! Go Irish!,Horrible. Nothing that has not been approved by CDC and has known side affects should be forced on someone.,That goes against the Nuremberg code,Do you all realize that all these pharmaceutical companies have had many lawsuits against them in the past and some still pending on products they have put out there that have destroyed people's lives and killed many.And were all approved by the FDA. I do believe you should check it out and then make your decision.,How can any university demand young people take a experimental vaccine when scientists don’t know the long term effects of the vaccine? Are my grandchildren being used for research by the pharmaceutical companies? Has testing been done to see if this experimental vaccine causes birth defects down the road?,My hope is that every student/family can have the support and freedom to choose what they feel is best for this experimental injection. (Edited),"Choice please. Severe adverse reactions are taking place from this. Thousands reported. People have severe reactions from these. Dr.’s are seeing high volumes of people coming in with blood clots::: heart issues and worse post V.
I hope you look deeper into this. This is very serious that you would mandate this on these college kids. Terrible.
VAERS is the reporting system. Go look.
Dr.s/
Microbiologists/
Immunologists are advising to know the risks. Death is listed as a potential side effect from the V.... and you are going to mandate that?
I encourage everyone to look up a Covid vaccine reactions group on Facebook or Insta if they haven’t been censored and spend some time reading some real life reactions from real people::: which could be you or a family member.","Shameful. This is not a traditional vaccine. The long term effects are unknown especially relating to autoimmune disorders::: fertility::: cancer::: and who knows what other health risks related to other coronavirus immune reactions. If you have already had covid::: are young (college kids)::: or are not metabolically at risk::: there is zero reason to take the vaccine. Why risk it? If you (teachers/
obese/
diabetics)are at risk::: take it. Everyone has their own risk profile. Mandating it is a terrible idea.

And for those that say follow the science::: the USA has a long history of rapidly approving new medical advances::: only to slowly admit they were wrong.","COVID poses minimal risk for most college-age people (survival rate >99.9%). FORCING them to take an experimental drug is beyond lunacy. There is absolutely NO data yet on the long-term effects of these ""vaccines"". ND is putting its trust in government (and so called ""experts"") over its trust in God. Whatever happened to individual liberty and personal responsibility?","We should all be concerned that people can be forced to take a vaccine that is experimental and give to an age group that we know has less that .2 mortality rate. Wake up people. Are we going to give up our rights so easily? Go to government adverse reporting website. Study the deaths reported after vaccine. This decision is appalling. Studies have all said schools should've never closed!
Vaers.hhs.gov",Does Notre Dame realize doctors all over the world are saying not to get the vaccine if you are planning on having children? So if you are female and attend UND::: you can never have children. Nice.,Why make it mandatory when probably 90% of students would still get it if it were readily available and merely suggested? Why not allow for freedom while still achieving herd immunity? Trying to force people to do things tends to lead to more resistance::: since people (particularly Americans) hate being told what to do.,What if a student has had covid and still has antibodies. The university will require them to put this vaccine into their bodies when they already have natural immunity ?,Shame on ND. Read the Science! I hope you have good lawyers on call.,Looking at these comments::: many people have not read the mission or purpose of Notre Dame which is “ a private Catholic research university.” Three key words Private. Catholic. Research. There are many reasons people elect not to go there::: religion based::: cost based::: ideology based::: and now vaccine based. But it’s the university’s decision.,"Yet they can't require an emergency use vaccine.

I hope parents withdraw their kids in droves.,So they want you to take a shot that was made in less than year so much for higher education,It’s the right decision.,What will happen with internal incoming students? In my home country the national vaccination is very slow and I don’t have the opportunity to be vaccinate here.,Cancel your football season tickets...sure they'll require vaccinations to get into games as well.,Some of these comments (one side more than the other) are filled with scorn and ridicule. This is unnecessary. This impulse for rudeness does not come from God.,Guess grandchildren won't go there. That was a idea for last 11 years.,We all can we see the same mandate to enter the stadium now that the students are required to be vaccinated,Amen::: amen::: amen. Naysayers who manufacture lies to further their cause beget fear in some of the most vulnerable.,So to attend there you must agree to be a lab rat.,"If you are someone who has a family history of or an individual risk of blood clotting::: and/or are a young woman::: please be aware of and self-monitor for the symptoms listed in this article if you have gotten the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. Talk to your doctor if you develop these symptoms. I know another woman (age 30) in addition to the women cited in this report::: who is currently going through testing for the same issue::: as well as another individual who developed acute ocular migraines after receiving the first of one of the two-shot vaccines and was advised by his doctor to not take the 2nd (booster) shot. I know the numbers of people adversely affected are still small::: but::: with any new vaccine::: any adverse affects::: especially unusual/not previously documented ones::: should be monitored and reported so we can better understand who should and should not receive certain vaccines and so that the vaccine production can be adjusted if necessary.

Terrible!!,"Yikes....that’s
pathetic .....so much for freedom",Notre Dame sadly now being run by Anti-American Marxists who teach that requiring voter ID’s is racist::: but requiring COVID EXPERIMENTAL vaccine on their students (for a virus that has a 97% survival rate) is OK.,So wrong and irresponsible to foist this experimental drug on young men and women who bear nearly zero risk from the Coronavirus.,People dont know the truth that the vaccination will cause the worse variants of the virus. Apparently it will help at the beginning but it will got worse later. In Israel people are already persuaded who didn’t get shots. Smart nations should stop the vaccination immediately.,So the University of Notre Dame is making it mandatory for all students to sign up for an experimental drug program. Wow::: what has become of our conservative college?,NOT A SMART MOVE RIGHT NOW!,Many universities have announced that they'll require vaccinations and I expect that most will.

Using your logic then can a Protestant Evangelical University dictate the sexual habits of their students?,"If your student is injured by the vaccine you do not get a redo. My son was vaccine injured at 4 years old and 25 years later he is not back to baseline. I wish I would have known about the risk. Every vaccine should be given after examining the personal risk vs benefit just like any other medical treatment. The Pfizer trial included 77 16 to 18 year olds in vaccine group

Thankfully vaccine injury is not common::: but when it happens to you there is no comfort in numbers.",Good job Notre Dame!,So wrong. A vaccine with less than 9 months of testing and you are forcing it on some of the least vulnerable. Fear and panic driven choice that does not follow the science as you bastions of higher learning ( she says with an eyeroll) love to say. Pre Covid::: when we listened to actual science a little better and not propaganda and fear mongering::: vaccines only had a 33 % success rate after going through 3 phases of testing and that was after years of trials. Yet you think it's a good idea to force a hastily created ( yes I know mRNA process of vaccine creation isn't new)::: barely tested::: vaccine on people.

Kids if you don't want that poison in your body change schools! Your life and health are more important!!!!!,Just tell them you identify as being vaccinated::: problem solved.,"A few thoughts for those claiming that the FDA hasn't approved the vaccine::: as if to say that the FDA thinks it's a large mystery and just doesn't know what to make of the vaccines.

I got the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine and beforehand had looked into it in some depth. The testing::: as described::: seemed clinically robust-\-\randomi
zed double blind placebo-control
led trials with a total of over 50:::000 participants. According to Pfizer's press release at the conclusion of the Phase 3 trial:::

""The only Grade 3 (severe) solicited adverse events greater than or equal to 2% in frequency after the first or second dose was fatigue at 3.8% and headache at 2.0% following dose 2. Consistent with earlier shared results::: older adults tended to report fewer and milder solicited adverse events following vaccination.""

And here's what the FDA says at their website (""Learn More About COVID-19 Vaccines""):

""How safe are the COVID-19 vaccines?

""The FDA evaluated data from clinical studies that included tens of thousands of people. The data from these studies clearly show that the known and potential benefits of the FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines greatly outweigh the known and potential risks.

""Millions of doses of FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines have been given to people all around the country. Serious adverse events following vaccination are very rare. No serious::: life-threatenin
g allergic reactions occurred in clinical study participants::: however::: after getting a COVID-19 vaccine in their community::: a few people had anaphylaxis (a severe::: life-threatenin
g allergic reaction that happens within seconds or minutes of exposure to an allergen). Because of this remote chance of severe allergic reaction::: health care providers may ask you to stay at the place where you received a vaccine for monitoring for 15 to 30 minutes.

""To date the FDA and other government agencies have not identified any new safety signals that raise questions about the risks and benefits of COVID-19 vaccines. A safety signal is information from one or more sources::: such as federal surveillance programs::: that suggests an adverse event may potentially be related to a vaccine or medicine and that further evaluation through additional studies or close monitoring may be needed.""

It's true that we are only into the early period of vaccination for COVID-19::: but according to the CDC about 56 million Americans have been fully vaccinated so far. If there were widespread dire consequences I believe we'd have been hearing about them. Perhaps there are some as yet unknown long-term nefarious effects; but there is no evidence for that proposition-\-\it
's simply conjecture.","The clinical trials did not have time to determine if the vaccine is safe for the fetuses of pregnant women nor for babies of women who intend to become pregnant. The CDC is encouraging anyone who gets the vaccine to join the V-safe registry to monitor both efficacy and safety and is further encouraging young pregnant women and those who became pregnant after getting the vaccine to join a separate registry to see what happens to babies born after mother has had vaccine. Are universities really ready to require young women to get the vaccine when they dont yet know the effect on their future babies.? https://

So why would a responsible::: thinking parent want their college-aged child to take this risk to avoid a virus that is of minimal risk to the young person? You can't say it's so they won't pass the virus onto others who are at higher risk from the virus because all of those people will be getting the vaccine.

-No long term studies.

-Not FDA approved.

-Zero liability of the vaccine manufacturers.

"In late July 2019::: the morning light shone through the windows of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and bounced off the hundreds of lamps and chandeliers::: brass statues and icons::: and coated the shrine at the spot of the crucifixion in a glowing white brilliance. A small group of Notre Dame students visiting took in the sight and then traversed down a flight of steps and across the main hall to the shrine of Jesus’ tomb.

Read how this holy site took on new significance for these students experiencing Notre Dame's presence in Jerusalem: https://go.nd.edu/LivingStones",4/2/2021 16:05,I read it all. Sure brought back memories of our time there and how badly the palestinians were treated. I really lost respect for the Israeiies.

"Notre Dame Admissions will continue with a test-optional policy for the 2022 and 2023 application years. First-year and transfer applicants will not be required to submit standardized test scores as part of their application for undergraduate admission.

The test-optional policy allows students to choose whether to submit a test score to be included in the evaluation of their application. The goal is to empower students to decide what they consider to be the strongest application to put forward to Notre Dame.

NEWS.ND.EDU
Notre Dame will continue test-optional policy for 2022 and 2023 application years",2/8/2021 19:53,"ND is not alone in this - many schools have already announced they will be test optional for the 2022 application year and I expect more will follow. Some of the other schools include: Harvard::: Northwestern::: Amherst::: Stanford::: Brown::: Boston College::: all University of California schools. The SAT and ACT are struggling to stay relevant. These schools can fill their classes several times over with kids who have perfect scores. Grades::: course rigor::: extracurricular
s::: community service::: recommendations
::: personal essays - all paint a much broader and more accurate picture of candidates than a single test score that given enough time and money can be improved upon.",It would seem that with a test-optional policy that there is necessarily no consistent objective standard. Potentially every application is without an objective benchmark making the selection process completely subjective if not potentially arbitrary. I can understand the desire to have some subjectivity in the selection process to address “special cases” but shouldn’t there be some objective marker that serves as a tie-breaker if nothing else?,While many may feel this is a negative::: in truth it is a positive. Over the course of the year::: many students have signed up multiple times in an attempt to take the SAT or ACT::: only to be turned away as the testing sites cancelled. These students::: my own child being one of them::: studied for months to ready themselves and were devastated and worried this would impact their chances at scholarships and college admittance. There are currently many universities that have taken the test optional approach::: even prior to the pandemic. One such example is the University of Chicago. I applaud Notre Dame for incorporating this policy. They are truly taking a holistic approach in the application process. I believe ND admissions will continue to accept the best and brightest students in the world regardless of going test-optional. Go Irish!🍀,"With a high school senior daughter accepted to Wake Forest which has been test optional for years::: we are very aware of the policy. There’s a reason so many schools (the Ivies were among the first) are moving to test optional::: which the pandemic only accelerated because most tests were canceled. Standardized tests alone have little correlation with college performance or performance afterwards. There is ample data out there now at the schools that have been test optional for years comparing students that submit test scores and students that don’t::: and there is no difference in performance. What everyone is realizing is that as a standalone the test is not a good predictor of success in college::: that there are better ways to evaluate an applicant in a more holistic way. Simply::: students that have high test scores but don’t have a super strong application otherwise are not as strong as students that have strong applications otherwise regardless of the test score.

And yes I was a bit bummed that the daughter of a proud Notre Dame grad chose to not go to Notre Dame! But I took her there in the winter to make sure she understood what winters were like and she hated it",Grading and academic vigor vary from high school to high school without a national standard across which students A::: B and C can be evaluated get ready for more students unable to survive academically,So sad to be dropping your standards so low. Notre Dame used to be know for high standards and excellence and now they can be like any state school around. SMH. Get rid of Jenkins,Please don’t insult me. You have lowered the value of every degree the University awarded.,This is absurd. Why not just let in the class clown? I grow increasingly ashamed of and embarrassed by my alma mater.,Mimi Tuohy O'Leary,David Allocco,Why?,No academic standards? May I have my $80k refunded to me for my MBA since you have just reduced its value to $0.00?,That must be why a young woman with a 1650 SAT was refused/ and both her father and grandfather are alum.

What will the excuse be next year... canceled due to the return of locust? Keep sending those requests for donations though.",Class of 2020 is a forgotten batch. We don’t need the prayers of Father Jenkins and the rest of the gang::: we need our commencement. The university owes this to the class of 2020.,My graduate said he expected it to be postponed::: but not by another year. It's easy to complain when we do not do the planning::: but truly::: the effort is questionable given that 2021 will have their ceremony with possible guests. If 2021 outside guests do attend; then yes::: it is a huge letdown. One that makes you wonder if they are just trying to avoid a 2020 function (in 2022!)::: by delaying it. It is so disappointing and I would urge the University to bring 2020 back in a reunion form so they can have closure::: see friends::: grab pictures::: and DOABLE with Covid testing available.,University of Notre Dame......it would be really cool::: if the students are required to wear masks for graduation::: if you issued a uniform mask::: along with their cap and gown::: with the school seal in the lower corner like the President of the United States!

This is a slap in the face to every student and parent who sacrificed for this degree. Someone must have other plans for Memorial weekend this year. Our 2020 graduates were promised a ceremony that weekend!!! 🤬🤬🤬,I'm not sure i understand why 21 can graduate but 2020 cannot.,How utterly unfair to the Class of 2020 and to the parents of the Class of 2020!,I appreciate it::: but think if limited family members are invited to class of 2021::: then class of 2020 grads only could be accommodated with Covid testing. Sooner.,It is so sad for us class 2020 !!

"When Notre Dame bestowed an honorary degree on Hank Aaron in 2005::: the citation referenced his legendary baseball career and concluded that::: most importantly::: he had done it all ‘fair and square.’ His many records::: particularly in the face of racial prejudice::: make him one of the greats of the game.

For as marvelous as his skills were::: his off-the-field accomplishments were just as — perhaps even more — important and long-lasting.

The catechism is abundantly clear that our Catholic faith demands that we show solidarity with those who are marginalized. Notre Dame’s choice to take a data driven::: proactive::: and ethically centered approach embodies all that is great about who we are. Each of these posts::: replete with the naysayers::: makes me more proud to stand with the University because taking a stand for Christian principles is rendered more enriching when it is opposed.,This is exactly what a catholic institution should be doing!

Notre Dame President condemns Capitol violence::: says Biden wants to heal 'fractured nation'",1/13/2021 13:45,The good father needs to stay the hell out of politics. He really has a long time history of coming across as a Catholic-light liberal hack.,Are there no progressive parents at ND? My son is thinking of applying but I'll strongly dissuade him if there are absolutely no progressive or even centrist leanings there. I'm genuinely asking.,ALL violence is wrong.. can't say it's ok for one group and not the other.,Condemning the domestic terrorism that occurred at the capitol is the least we should expect from leaders::: religious or otherwise. Glad to see it.,The number of people who commented without reading the actual interview is sad. I hope they aren't fellow alum because that does not reflect well on the university's success in teaching critical thinking skills.,I completely disagree with the ND president and I’m a ND fan but his views are NOT my views nor millions of ND fans! We need to completely address our universities and their liberal agendas.,It makes zero sense::: except from the perspective of wealthy donors who want to benefit from their “investments” that we have a binary system that forces sensible Catholics and Christians with religious leaning on the choice issue to sign up for everything else currently aligned with American conservatism. Our broken system only benefits the few.,We are “progressive “ parents and my husband is an alum and our dad is a double domer.,My daughter graduated from there in ‘10. She is progressive::: liberal and so am I. We both still love thee Notre Dame::: despite their ideology.,Father Jenkins Pope Saint John Paul ll would be so ashamed of you. Our Saint fought Communism his whole life. Now Father Jenkins you are embracing Communism .

How about we abide by Catholic doctrine since we are a Catholic university.,He's as bad as this hypocritical Pope we have .,I’d hardly call this an isolated incident. Definitely a larger scale of violence::: but similar to many incidents across the country. We all need to be vigilant in defending democracy and the rule of law. Class of ‘78,I hate to break this to all the “Catholic Doctrine” and “ND is too liberal” people commenting here: Jesus was a liberal socialist.,As do we all!

You’re walking the slippery slope of hypocrisy otherwise.,"“Isolated incident”...sad

Especially after the destruction::: looting and burning of America was ignored.,ND has become way too liberal for me. Stopped being a fan months ago. They don't practice what the preach.,"ND needs to stay out of politics. You’re just showing how far left the ND leaders are. ND is supposed to be a Catholic University. Hasn’t been that in a very long time. I’m a Catholic but this University is really disgusting!!!!!
!!!!",He’s right::: and I question the moral convictions of anyone who says otherwise,More ridiculous nasty banter back and forth. Come on everyone::: stop it! Respect each other’s opinions.,Fr. Jenkins needs to stay in his office and count the billions of dollars of endowment money ND has.,Wow::: my respect for Notre Dame is gone. Used to look up to you::: but no longer. What a disgrace to our nation and especially to the Catholic Church.,But the burning and looting of cities kept them quiet...hmm,"What is their stance on the peaceful protest that burnt down billions of dollars of property::: lost lives of the citizens::: beating of police officers......?
Or are you going to say something about it just because I brought it up but stay silent if no on brings it up? Yep",Right...that perfect Catholic..I used to love Notre Dame...I was thrilled at everything about it..,Sorry Fr. Jenkins::: you may want to believe that::: but his words and actions don’t support your belief.,He’s does want to heal. He’s causing division.,"Fe Jenkins is no Fr Hesburgh!
Notre Dame has changed under his leadership::: perhaps not for the better.",If Jenkins and Notre Dame would have exhibited any sort of balance and reasonableness over the last four years::: I would be more likely to listen to his calls for unity.,It’s pretty hard to call this an isolated incident::: when literally everyone saw it coming.,Lost any respect I had for him which wasn't much.,Look beyond the politics and look at love. Follow Jesus he literally lived to give us an example.,"Progressive parents and students for sure!!
Daughter graduated last year....👍👍👍👍",You’re a joke Notre Dame.,He won't heal anything...he is trying his best to create issues already,Ask him to stop the slaughter of not only the unborn but even the born if they make it.,Notre Dame shouldn’t have an input on any politics.,Virtue signal much? Be better ND.,If he wants to heal the fractured nation tell him to concede and admit the fraudulent votes!,After he finished dividing it🤦🏻‍♂️,Jenkins is doing something right judging by the invective in many of these posts. Many here would have been right at home in Franco’s Spain.,As a lifelong ND fan::: THIS is the final straw. F U ND.,GO N.D!

Good ::: and Go IRISH ☘️,Politics should be kept out of education. Big fan but this is disappointing.,We need to hear and head the words of St Francis now more than ever!,Anybody who knows anything about Notre Dame knows of the school’s reverence of our country::: it’s Constitution::: and it’s founding principles. “God::: Country::: Notre Dame” isn’t just a catch phrase. It is lived out in everyday life and teaching at ND. To NOT be outraged by what happened at the Capitol is to side with terrorists::: and show you do not care about this country::: only it’s cultic leader. It’s not enough to keep quiet about happened. Less than outrage is to show your contempt for the Constitution::: which defines our country.,Goodbye Irish ☘️,We shall see Father his rhetoric says different then what you are proposing.,Isolated incident??? Wow. No guilt or shame.,Thank you Father Jenkins !,This is the correct answer.,Watch out Joe::: you-re walking with retros!,Jesus was born in the Middle East and conservatives believe he was a white male. Jesus was more liberal than conservatives want to believe. Not saying this is good or bad but I’m not so arrogant as to claim I know the mind of Jesus Christ. However::: based on his own words::: at least those passed on through the Bible::: it shouldn’t be hard to guess which side he would come down on if he were here today.

What happened on Wednesday was an affront to our Constitution::: a violent siege meant to cause harm against our elected officials::: and it was based on a egregious lie fomented by this President. There is no equivalence to any other event. Moreover::: it was antithetical to Catholic teaching and the mission of Notre Dame. Notre Dame condemns ALL violence::: always::: but we were also taught to engage in peaceful debate rooted in facts and to have respect and compassion for everyone. And to the parents above whose son is thinking of applying::: most of my ND alum friends are centrist or progressive and are appalled at what happened last week. Please do not dissuade your son from applying::: because it is a great school with great people. Kudos to Father Jenkins for his statement.,I love that people are upset by this. Weed the idiots out. Go Irish. Very proud of him,"Thank you Notre Dame for standing on the side of peace.

To all the white surpremacist posting angry comments. ... Protests over the death of unarmed citizens are not the same as attacks on the capital and an attempt at sedition. We are a democracy and will remain a democracy despite your radical actions and desires.

I’ve never met Fr Jenkins except thru his actions. I agree with him on this one.. albeit for a different reason(s). But disagree on most other matters. From responses on other postings I’ve made I suspect app 40% of ND grads are anti Fr J. Why ? Because he’s lowered the bar at the University . He’s forgotten that it’s a school ... not a social experience. He doesn’t understand that dignity and pride and other virtues come from challenge and personal achievement. Just something to think about. And not forget.,I don’t agree with Father Jenkins’ pronouncement on capital punishment::: but I understand his rationale and the sincerity of his belief. What I don’t understand is his reluctance to speak out just as strongly on behalf of the millions of unborn who are murdered each year::: even though they::: unlike the criminals on death row::: have done nothing wrong.,God said is you put them to death and send them to me for judgement :::these things will stop happening!

U guys R reall appreciated it very much.,Beautiful picture,"Dear 2020:::

Today I bid you farewell. You kneecapped me a few times::: but you also embedded marvelous memories deep within my heart.

For example::: the memory of my last hug with another human on 3/22/20. It was a playful::: joyful hug with a laughing::: three-year-old little girl as we played with her toy cars. (Her yellow Corvette overtook and totaled my red Mustang.)

The deep feelings of accomplishment and marvel as I watched the growth of the spindly little flowers that I planted in my flower boxes last Spring.

By the end of June::: they’d burst forth in wild abandon. Their cacophony of colors and scents many times brought tears of joy to my eyes as I lounged on my porch::: enjoying the color coordinated sunset.

Somehow::: those flowers and the colors of the evening skies magnified each other’s beauty::: as if they were lovers::: sharing a tender “good night”.

Oh. And the walks on the beaches. The sheer volume of odd and beautiful agates that I came across. It was as if Ocean pushed her gentle waves up to my feet and then slowly retreated::: leaving handfuls of beautiful treasures right where I stood.

You allowed me to have a last conversation with someone extraordinarily
dear to me::: Sr. Elaine DesRosiers::: two days before she died from COVID-19 on 12/16/20. It was a kind of a miracle::: actually. She was hooked up to so many machines that were helping her to breathe. Sometimes::: it was really hard to hear her over the mechanical sounds::: but she was lucid. She was forward thinking (She reminded me that she owes me a painting.) We reminisced about the past 40 years. We laughed A LOT!

All in all::: 2020::: you’ve been most beautiful and kind. I just wanted to say::: “thank you”.",Happy New Year! 🙏,Go Irish,Cindy Lindquist,Go Irish ☘️,Christine L Smith,Go Irish,🙏🍀❤️,"Happy New Year!

This extraordinary and unusual alignment of the two largest planets in our solar system last occurred in 1623.

Congratulations::: #ND2025!",12/16/2020 23:52,Welcome Home::: class of 2025 ☘️!,My daughter was denied and is devastated. She has been a straight A student her whole life and her extra curricular activity list is excellent::: not to mention community service and her religion. Sad night in this household.,My daughter got denied. As international student we certainly did not offer them enough money. She is academically very strong. She is devastated,I'd love to but today the Admissions Dept turned down my Grandson::: a young man of the highest character::: academic excellence::: and values which are the essence of Notre Dame::: not to mention the multiple summers he spent on the ND campus in athletic and academic programs::: his outstanding record of community service::: and the now ended legacy of his grandfather::: great grandfather and uncle as Notre Dame grads an a double Domer. A deeply sad evening for the Mastro/Moran family tonight considering that his credentials and qualifications to be a Notre Dame student exceed those of all three of his legacy family member ND grads . . . . . . and our hearts forever::: love thee Notre Dame.,That photograph is outstanding. Have a safe semester. 💙💛☘️,Welcome to the Notre Dame family. Go IRISH!,this day was the most magical day for our family last year-and his first semester experience just emphasized how amazing this day was....love the Notre Dame.,Feeling very blessed to have my son accepted tonight. So many talented applicants that for any::: it is a toss up depending on the need of the university to create their class. I understand the disappointment and the stress (had a horrible headache today just from the stress of waiting because as a mom you want your child to reach their dreams). But he’s my youngest and I have seen my share of ups and downs. It really will work out the way it’s supposed to and in the timeframe it’s supposed to. (((Hugs))) to all::: and the moms and dads who sweat it out right with the kids.,Grandson got deferred Nick Fedorenko ...4.8 on a 4.0 gpa cross country champ...JJ Coynes daughter deferred too (son Bill Wertz Navy buddy) but still in the game,I got denied as well in 2003.

"A digital image of a famous piece of art doesn’t tend to stir the soul in the same way as looking at it while standing in the same room. The context matters.

Theology and psychology faculty will explore this idea in an 18-month research project exploring the ways in which viewing art informs and enhances spiritual growth and how that changes based on time and place. Their findings could help churches and museums shape messaging and offer more powerful encounters with paintings and sculptures.

They approached the Wilson Sheehan Lab for Economic Opportunities - LEO - at Notre Dame to assess if the emergency financial assistance they provide through the call-in line helps prevent homelessness.

LEO found that the financial assistance made recipients 76 percent less likely to become homeless::: and kept more than 700 children off the Chicago streets. Now other cities across the country are using Notre Dame’s work to inform their own strategies on homelessness prevention: https://go.nd.edu/WWYFFHomelessness

This evening::: Fr. Jenkins addressed the campus community to offer three brief messages of thanks and provide an update on the current state of coronavirus spread in the campus community.,10/15/2020 21:31,I’m so happy you are back to good health Father. Everyone makes mistakes . We are all human . Notre Dame means so much to me and my family.,Most importantly is that you are well. After all we are family What we want to see and hear from you is that your arrogance will not take center stage anymore. Fr Jenkins ::: please go Forward with humility to help students and faculty with whatever they might need. Get out of that office and get into the dorms. Remember who you are.,"Father::: we thank God for your total recovery::: we are infinitely grateful for all that you do to take care of our children and we admire your humility::: which for us is a testimony.

Keep Forward Notre Dame for the Glory of God!",I'm glad you're well. I love ND; my entire family does. My best classes were taught at ND. Regarding your comments: talk is cheap. Not good enough. The students deserve better.,I accept your apology::: Father Jenkins. I pray that you continue to be assertive in the control of COVID in and around campus. If my son was there now::: I would be practically hysterical that he and all his friends follow the strict regulations for preventing the virus from expanding. But now I am a grandmother and pray for all who are associated with the great University of Notre Dame. Go Irish!,"As a Christian I forgive u::: but will never forget. You showed selfishness:::irr
esponsibility::: lack of caring::: and as an educator you showed you didn't believe in Dr's. You put human life at risk. Your decision could have or still could kill someone. I believe in forgiveness but I also believe they're consequences for your actions. And with that you should be fired. You had a responsibility to be a leader and you failed

With that said praise the lord you are better and healthy. God bless you Father",Thanksful that you are recovering Father Jenkins. God bless you::: all faculties::: staffs::: and all other workers who have made personal sacrifices to keep ND a safe place as much as it could. Thank you! 🙏,We can forgive but we will not forget what a poor example of leadership you have been during this extremely difficult time. If you truly believed in the science behind this pandemic::: you would not continue to risk the lives of students::: faculty::: and South Bend community members with an in-person learning strategy that has led to nearly a thousand positive cases. We are tired of hearing the excuses and pleas for students to change—it’s time to see that change come from you.,Long and dreary days ... which over 200 thousand people have died from. You are not a leader and show reckless disregard for students and staff. You have put your entire campus at risk in order to celebrate a power grab for the Supreme Court. RESIGN,I have never been more humbled by any speech. Thank God for seeing you through the period of it. I learned humility from this speech,Father::: your humility is inspiring. Sending love and prayers from the Big Easy. Go Irish!,What?! Will you forgive and reinstate students you dismissed for their important choice of not wearing a mask and throwing a party? They were immature 21 year olds. You attended a “party” as a mature leader. I can forgive you::: of course::: but seriously??? Not in the same ballpark. You restricted student travel::: required masks and broke both requirements as an adults with a mature brain.,So happy you are feeling better. It would have been nice if you refrained from the political comments. It was your choice not to wear a mask. May God bless you::: staff and students at ND- Go Irish!,Thankfully you’re being safe::: recovering well::: appreciate your kindness and caring for Universty of Notre Dame. We are human beings who are allowed to learn from our mistakes as we are children of God’s. We are always allowed to forgive from our deepest hearts! We pray most oftentimes to help us heal::: be safe::: be strong::: and help us focus on positive faith. Fr. Jenkin we are happy for you to be well. Blessings and Gods be with you always.,But you recovered as 96% do and you are in the older age group. We need to stop with the crazy paranoia. Chronic illness::: comorbidity::: advanced age; stay home don’t even trust a mask.,No apology necessary. ND has provided a great opportunity for the kids to be on campus this semester. Lots of hard work to make it happen! Thank you.,"I’m disinclined to listen. Saddened by the poor judgement he’s reflected recently::: specifically with respect to COVID and saddened further by the support for an extraordinarily
partial candidate for the Supreme Court whose views are devastating for so many.",My son did not get graduation yet you went to the Rose Garden.,Thanks Father. I forgive you::: give you christian grace::: and let's move forward. Go Irish.,Stay well::: Father. Bring our children to the strong finish they’ve worked for::: this semester required sacrifices for many. Go Irish!,Fr. Jenkins lacks the moral authority to lead my alma mater. You should resign and in the best traditions of Catholic penance retire to a monastery for a period of reflection and metanoia. You've become way too big for your britches and entirely lost the wisdom of servant leadership. '74,"Humbleness. Setting a great example.
We all deserve a second chance Go Irish !☘️☘️☘️",It takes a strong character to admit your mistakes and ask forgiveness,It would have been a better apology if you hadn’t used the opportunity to take a political jab.,Father Jenkins is an embarrassment and should step down. He is demonstrating the worst behavior of humanity: selfishness and support for a godless man. We could not be more disappointed in his behavior. Wear a blessed mask 😷,Fr. Jenkins for your penance say five Hail Marys and wear your mask as you have asked your students to do!!,God bless the faculty::: staff::: and all other workers who have made personal sacrifices to keep ND open. Fr. Jenkins should have known better.,So happy you have recovered. Please take care and your apology is accepted! Go Irish! ☘️,You are transparently political. Had to get a little dig in on the White House::: right.. Just petty And what we’ve come to expect from your feckless leadership::: If you can call it that.,"Your actions are the reason the student body cannot have a normal college experience this year. You added to the ongoing problem knowing you were in the wrong but you played the lemming and went with the crowd. I'll forgive you but I will not forget. Actions speak louder than words. 😷✌💚 #GodCountryNotre
Dame","Thank you for contributing to the spread of COVID. I now have 2 friends and 1 relative who have lost parents due to the spread. Your choices and behavior are shameful. Leaders like you are to set an example of how to behave not how to skirt responsibility.
Shame! Shame on you. Very disappointing and down right neglectful.",He made a HUGE mistake. He knows it and regrets it. He won’t make another one of this magnitude. His apology is sincere. He should be forgiven. Move on!,Only those who are part of the campus community as students::: faculty and staff are privileged to comment. Their opinions are the only ones that matter..,Maybe you should not be the spokes person at this time...,Apology accepted. Let's move on. He has been a leader in opening the campus and having the University work hard to keep our kids safe and engaged. Yes he made a big mistake::: but Forgiveness is part of the ND culture. Go Irish! ☘,The fact that alum are willing to just brush the extreme error in leadership after all the sacrifices the students and faculty have pmade is insane. Unsafely attending a farce of a ceremony for a hack of a judge::: potentially endangering students while going again University guidelines is not okay.,Glad you’re recovered Father Jenkins::: meanwhile many of your aged staff and faculty are exhausted from juggling jobs::: virtual learning for our school age kids and being separated from our parents and grandchildren::: an extended payed winter vacation is in order::: don’t you think? We need time to recover from Covid exhaustion,"OK. Will students who disregard the Covid guidelines be able to say ""Thank you in advance for your forgiveness"" as he does here? That would seem just.",What about the kids that were expelled? Sorry wasn’t good enough for them,No one::: no one person is perfect and we all make mistakes. Some mistakes are larger than others. Apologies and asking for forgiveness is at the heart of our faith. We are glad Father Jenkins has recovered and now we move on. Go Irish ☘️☘️,You made a terrible mistake and got sucked into our Presidents circus and embarrassed the University.,This one is too big! He does not get to walk free on this! HE SETS THE EXAMPLE! He did not even wear a mask at the White House event. Do as I say not as I do! Wrong!,Thank you for your honesty and your apology. Glad you are feeling better. 🙏🏻☘️,Kids here are so fortunate to have most of their classes in person and outdoor social settings and events.,Giving and receiving forgiveness is at the heart of our Catholic faith. Glad to see that Fr. Jenkins is doing well.,Thank you for your efforts Fr Jenkins - you and our great University remain in our prayers ❤️🙏🏻,Thank you Father Jenkins let’s all pray that this terrible disease leaves us soon and Notre Dame our Mother pray for us All,None of us is perfect— this behavior was a terrible mistake but Fr. Jenkins seems sincere in his apology.,And you didn’t think of the poor example BEFORE going to that event. In the days of a Pandemic. Knowing what IS required because you demand it of the students you are in charge of::: you CHOSE to deliberately break those CDC guidelines to be in the limelight! Sorry — verbal apology not enough. This was a BIG mistake and goes to the core of determining if you are a qualified leader for my Alma Mater . Shameful. Just for PR. Shameful.,Apology; Contrition; Forgiveness; Move Forward; Go Irish!,We are only human and make mistakes..you as a father know that. How refreshing it would be for people to be less critical of our President also.,You should disavow Barrett. Show some human decency.,"You didn't get ""swept up"" by a White House that is ignoring Covid guidelines. You willingly and actively put yourself in a position and statement of supporting that circus...and::: by the way::: if that was an apology::: it was pretty weak.",Too late. You damaged the campus::: the community and the truth of science for a party at the White House.,"WHAT ?? nobody wants his head on a platter like you do with Coach Kelly ??? Hypocrites one and all..."" he that is without Sin:::cast the first stone"".....",I am far from a fan of Father Jenkins. I am glad he apologized but regret that he sandwiched the apology between two bookend statements to lessen the emphasis. And that he could not make a sincere personal apology without criticizing the President.,Apology accepted! Go Irish ☘️,gonna take some time and prayer to figure out how to react to this::: very disappointed in you as the leader of the University.,Apology accepted but a Mask should’ve been worn. We all make mistakes.,Your reckless behaviour put students at risk. Now you must do the ethical thing and step aside.,And no mention of the honor to ND on Amy Coney Barrett or liberal professors who criticized her- not the ND I graduated-Go Irish ☘️,It was a good lesson in humility. I’ve been there many times::: Father Jenkins::: I do understand. I say we just all move forward and keep the ND students healthy. Hugs to Joe Afuso::: sophomore. ☘️GO IRISH!☘️,It is not a question of forgiveness. He simply lost credibility in the eyes of many people in this community.,Thanks for standing up for science during a pandemic!,Let's repent of our failures::: and renew our efforts::: and finish strong! Go Irish.,Wearing a mask is no guarantee you won’t contract the virus. I know. Wearing a mask is important because if you have the virus in some cases it does prevent the spread of the virus.,Such a kind humble humble word. I hold no ill will whatsoever. Mistakes are made. This is hard and no one is handling this thing perfectly. Very thankful for ACB and frankly I’m glad you were there. There is nothing wrong with enjoying the beautiful honor of her nomination. Should have done so with a mask even though you were probably tested before entry but it’s over. God uses our challenges::: mistakes::: all of it to shape and grow us. Thank you for pressing forward towards normal. Praying.,"Isn't it something seeing so many ""apology not accepted"" by so many.

I guess the whole forgiveness::: path to salvation and understanding that people do make mistakes once in awhile is only acceptable under your right circumstances::: eh? Or are you people so perfect that you never do anything wrong::: ever? Get off your tower so ivory that it's blinding you.",Why must you denigrate the president in your remarks?,Make me ashamed of my Almamater,"Apology accepted. Whatever possessed you??? A ""leader"" at ND?😕",Just weeks to go until what?,Thank you::: Father. We feel blessed our daughter is part of your ND family.,Nice message. Glad you are feeling better Father,Ought include an apology for his behavior!,A true leader leads by example. Sadly::: this was not the case here.,Glad u recovered but maybe u will see the President is doing his job and not support the BLM like Clemson,Poor leadership and get your faculty in line to stop engaging in politics !,Sounds good to me. Go Irish,The political jab was not right,Thank you Fr. Jenkins! You have been an amazing leader for the University. We are so thankful that you are well. We all make mistakes and even better that you can be a witness to the children that we are not all perfect. God bless you!,Hypocrisy as usual. So over the Catholic Church,Father John don’t blame the White House for your mistake,Who in their right mind would ever believe anything this poor excuse of a leader would say? No mask::: no social distancing. The man without conscience.,I don’t care if you did t have a mask on. I care about you being way too liberal. It’s not Donald trumps fault you didn’t wear a mask. Grow up. Man your mistakes,FrJenkins::: the hypocricy lives loudly inside you! What about the students who were severely punished for breaking the rules::: huh? What about THEM? Or are rules just for the commoners?,Im glad you are ok. Now get back to destroying the football program and making ND a Liberal college,"Hessburgh would not do
That",🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻👏👏👏👏🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸,Happy you are well! GO ND! ... only look forward 🙌,My Heart and prayers are with you,Thanksful you are recovering Father Jenkins .

You are no better. The who idea of college as you have forgotten is to grow and learn. To make the world better for ALL. Not just Catholics.

However::: I was disgusted to see the President of Notre Dame attending the President's super spreader event without a mask. He at least should know he has a moral obligation to protect others from pestilence. What a disgrace. No mask on Barrett either. Looks ethically situational to me.,How about your president not attending super spreader events? Notre Dame is a shining example of why this raised and former catholic now denounces the catholic church.,It's just sinful that the president of this university::: a priest::: attended a WH function and did not wear a mask. I can't get over this when churches everywhere are social distancing and asking parishioners to wear a mask. It was brazen and reckless and we all know better.,I'm a life long Catholic and am extremely disappointed by the lack of leadership and common sense exhibited by Rev. John Jenkins who failed to wear a mask at a White House functions-\-\ now he has coronavirus. Moreover::: Rev. Jenkins has succeeded in furthering the negative stereotype of Catholic priests.,"As a Notre Dame alumnus::: I can't even begin to express my disappointment in Fr. Jenkins' lack of leadership. Instead of doing the right thing::: he apparently wanted to mingle with the country's right wing ""intelligentsia
"" (quotation marks intended to signify sarcasm). I join with the students who have signed the petition for his resignation and ask that he show humility and resign his position. In doing so::: he can show the country the proper attitude::: and give an example to all of us.",I'm a life long catholic who is extremely disappointed by the lack of leadership and basic common sense exhibited by Rev. John Jenkins who attended a White House function without wearing a mask-\-\ because no else was wearing one; he went along with the crowd. Rev. Jenkins now has zero credibility and unfortuntely furthers the negative stereotype of catholic priests...,"The President of Notre Dame is an irresponsible person who did not wear a mask in public. He is Covid-19 positive. What kind of an example is this for the teachers::: staff & students of Notre Dame?
Leaders lead by example.",The school has already shown::: e.g. with its football team::: that it cares more for money and power than leadership::: concerns for others::: setting a Christian example::: etc. during these times so why are we not surprised that like everyone else dismissing this pandemic they are only sorry when they get caught? But don't worry::: our thoughts and prayers are with you.,Over 200:::000 people have died from this virus and the President of Notre Dame::: a Catholic Priest who should be spending his life doing Jesus' work::: intentionally infects everyone he came into contact with after leaving the White House. I hope he went to confession when he got home. Shameful! And you wonder why people have stop going to church. As a Catholic I am VERY disappointed at your reckless regard for you fellow human beings. This is in direct contract to the teaching of the church.,Rev. Jenkins needs to resign. He demonstrates no interest in protecting the health of safety of the students::: faculty and staff he is entrusted to lead.,So::: it's ideology above spirituality::: huh? Another phoney-baloney catholic mess.,"President Jenkins being diagnosed with COVID after attending the White House ceremony for the Supreme Court nominee::: and failing to wear a mask is despicable. If an ND student failed to follow protocols::: they would face serious sanctions. I find his comments hypocritical. How shocking for a Catholic priest in a position of power...Not. Jenkins is a horrible role model....he speaks with a forked tongue based on his actions. He needs to resign and those who oversee him should demand his resignation. SHAME!! https://

Guess that's what it means to be ""building a Notre Dame that is bigger and better than ever""::: like the motto by Rev. John I. Jenkins displayed here says.",As a Christian college that follows Jesus you should fire your president NOW.

Step up to the plate and do the right thing. It's appalling.,Extremely disappointed in the lack of leadership there. It's not like it's something new to wear a mask to protect others.

In addition to regular standards of conduct::: students involved in unsafe gatherings::: whether on or off campus::: or who display a persistent disregard for our health and safety practices in academic or campus settings may be referred to the University conduct process. Unsafe gatherings include those where masks are not worn and/or large numbers over 20 are gathered with disregard for physical distancing guidelines.

Community members::: whether students::: faculty::: or staff::: should report unsafe behavior with specific addresses::: names::: and details.

Should be removed. How many students tested positive!! You can only lead by example.,I wish President Jenkins a swift and full recovery. One must also ask how he could be so reckless and irresponsible as he failed to take the coronavirus seriously or to practice safety protocols that the university expects of its students. Is this leadership?,What is the university going to do about its President who contracted COVID19 because he ignored his own policy about preventing the pandemic? What credibility will he still have in requiring students to observe the policy?,ND brags about the most curious things. In fact::: you should be confessing your sins and begging God and the citizens of this country for forgiveness. Your president is irresponsible and hypocritical. From what I’ve seen here::: your alumni are deserting you as well.,Notre Dame::: I need help to start a nationwide Mask Up Campaign. Thanks,How dare the president of this prestigious university not wear a mask at a large event and then come back to endanger the lives of thousands of young people? The students who are protesting are correct; he needs to resign.,Politics before safety is truly a reckless decision. Kudos to the students taking a stand.,Sheer hypocrisy::: and at such a level. It's so sad::: what have we come to. This is not what Jesus meant.,Very irresponsible leadership though not surprising given his track record. If you want to lead by example and do the right thing::: resign immediately.,A school of higher education being run by someone who clearly has no brain. Just another reason to hate Notre Dame.,Very disappointed that the university president went to the Supreme Court nomination. Not appropriate,THE PRESIDENT should be fired::: how can you ask your students and staff to wear a mask and stay socially distant. If you do not due the right thing.

That is integrity,"There should not be a nomination at this time and when there is::: I would not support someone with such extremist interpretations
of either the law or Catholicism.",Why should we celebrate this?,She was a bipartisan elect for the U.S. Court of Appeals. She has a record of not putting personal agenda in front of rulings. She literally wrote a paper regarding judges recusing oneself from judgement that interfere with Catholic faith. This was brought up 2017. You all know that the Court rules on the law::: and does not make them...right? They do have interpretive insight on judgment::: but the law is the law.,She is a good reflection to Notre Dame and a product of a Catholic education,You are a credit to your school and an inspiration to moms everywhere. Godspeed.,"Congratulations
Judge Coney Barrett! We are praying for you and your family.
I hope the graciousness and class you showed in your acceptance speech is mirrored by the politicians that will debate your confirmation.",She studied the constitution at Notre Dame. Let’s hope she follows it in her decisions should she become a SCOTUS,"Proud day for the Irish! Congratulations
on your nomination::: Judge!",So incredibly disappointed to see President Jenkins NOT WEARING A MASK while in the Rose Garden for this announcement. The university has worked so tirelessly to prevent the spread of the virus on campus and keep the university open. I have donated to support this effort. To see Father Jenkins in a large gathering in close quarters without a mask was disheartening and honestly made me angry. Leadership dictates doing the right thing all the time::: everywhere. And according to the university’s message to students and staff - wearing a mask is the right thing. Disappointed.,"Again::: Notre Dame is in the forefront! Congratulations
Judge Barrett Go Irish🍀",One does not have to agree with her judicial philosophy (I do not) to be respectful and be proud of the University.,Excellent choice! As a ND family::: proud to have Judge Coney Barrett be nominated! 🇺🇸❤️,What a great choice! Proud alum!,Go Irish ☘️,With no game today::: we have something even bigger to celebrate!!!!

She will make an excellent Justice on the United States Supreme Court for many decades to come. Go Irish! ☘️,"People who follow the Catholic University of Notre Dame lamenting the fact that an ultra-qualified
::: Catholic graduate and faculty member of the same university has been nominated to the Supreme Court. Shaking my head. Maybe people need to find another school and/or religion to support.

Great selection.",As a lifelong ND fan::: I can’t get on board with this. It’s a shame to promote the University over Women’s Rights and all else considered right now. Qualified vs what is the right fit for the Court and women in general::: are two different things.,"She'll knock us back fifty years.
We don't need her religion or control over our bodily autonomy.",Awesome and someone snag her for ND commencement 2021 keynote - quick.,Thrilling!! So proud. Go Irish!,Not the right time. Not the right nominee. I truly do not understand how any good::: intelligent Christian could accept a nomination by this president.,Her religious allegiance that she places front and center::: disqualifies her::: and renders her not deserving of sitting on the Highest Court of our land.,"Congratulations
to Judge Barrett. A wonderful example for women and for all Americans who strive to create a full & fulfilling life. She has lived the American Dream::: and now she is in a position to secure that Dream continues for all.",OUTSTANDING BACKGROUND AND EDUCATUON::: WE SALUTE YOU JUDGE AMY.,The Supreme Court will be blessed to have her. ☘️,She is immensely qualified. A proud representative for the university. Go Irish!,"Congratulations
on what I’m sure is a well deserved nomination and the honor of a lifetime. She’s no doubt qualified and I’m sure a wonderful person. I hope that her moment is not stolen by the unfortunate and immature behavior of our “leaders” in the nation’s capitol.","Awesome! Judge Barrett will make a fantastic Supreme Court justice.

Go Irish! ☘️🇺🇸",this is awesome. !!!! She is a GREAT representative of Notre Dame !!,Great choice no matter what political side your on,"Congratulations
Amy- you will be an asset to the court and a highly trusted and admired judge. 🇺🇸","Studied at a great university! Learned from them! And has continued to be a great success! Thank you Notre Dame! Congratulations
Amy! GO IRISH!!",Do not be afraid nor dismayed because of this great army::: for the battle is not yours::: but God’s !!!! May God Be With You Judge,Outstanding! Go Irish!,Amazing news! So proud! Go Judge Barrett and Go Irish!! ☘️☘️,I think she’ll make a terrific judge. She’s smart::: capable and will be an asset to the Court.,"And on a day when ND football is postponed due to covid::: instead of being a leader::: Fr Jenkins followed the actions of others by not wearing a mask. Even if everyone were tested::: ND football showed that you could test negative until a viral load large enough to test positive builds and that the virus could be present...let's
risk bringing it back to campus where he already apologized once to students for ignoring his own protocol. Disheartening.",Congrats 🇺🇸 & Go Irish! ☘️,There should be deep shame about the president of this University and this appointee now::: given their public display of disregard for life. How embarrassing to be a mother of seven and show such poor judgment::: especially in the public eye.,Excellent Choice. She will represent Notre Dame well.,Ready for some Fighting::: Irish? This will be a doozy. I hope she's appointed.,Great honor and prestige for the University with this nomination. Go Irish! Go Judge Amy!,I am not proud of this! Not at all. It's a blow for women across the country. Thisposition is not about your religious beliefs.,Let’s go Irish!,I hope she is strong. She is going to go through hell from the left.,Really Father::: she has no intention to pursue justice,"Congratulations
::: Professor Barrett!
I am very proud of University of Notre Dame! God bless you.",Whether she gets the job or not- what a great accomplishment and to raise 7 children. Well done!!,A woman of character. She is needed on the court. Go Irish.,Well said Fr. John! We are all so very proud of Judge Amy & pray for her confirmation!,All the very best to her from across the Pacific! Wishing her a successful confirmation! Go Irish! ☘️☘️☘️☘️☘️,"Deeply disappointed. While she’s clearly a learned scholarly woman and deserves recognition for her accomplishments
::: I question any woman’s integrity who willingly allows her legacy to be forever attached to the most UNCHRISTIAN-LIK
E POTUS this nation has ever known.",Our thoughts and prayers are with you and your family Judge Barrett! ☘️☘️☘️,"Her university education has zero to do with her qualifications.
I am embarrassed by these ridiculous qualifications applauded by religious supporters. Today’s ND is not my ND from Father Ted’s ND.",Disgusted and embarrassed::: I will no longer support an institution that harbors individuals who seek to destroy the constitution and take away rights from Americans. There is separation of church and state for a reason.,President Jenkins needs to resign. What a terrible example you set for your student body. And Amy Coney Barrett is not Supreme Court material.,Can’t believe how Catholicism has gotten so conservative. I loved ND in 1970 when we were fighting against the war and draft. Father Toohey::: an ex-marine::: was on our side all the way. He supported each individual the right to choose::: the philosophy of the other::: and acceptance. Since then the church has moved to a place that I do not recognize. The groups that support way out religion where people blabber in tongues and think men are superior! I am appalled at this nomination and the fact that law professors support such a low life Leader and his appointees!,Sad day for the Irish.,She’s a disgrace to our lady’s university. Her anti women anti heAlthcare stances are not what Jesus would have advocated,"Great Choice! Congratulations
to Judge Coney Barrett on her nomination.",Agree 100% Nora. No mask wearing::: putting others at danger. These are not the kind of role models we need.,Any country that influences politics with religion is taking a dangerous direction. The foundation of radical states. Just take a look around the globe.,Awe..yes a woman with seven kids who allows herself to be deemed a “handmaid” due to her cultist religious beliefs. The religious zealots are eating it up..the progressive women who vastly out number them..not so much..,As a 3x ND grad and former student of Professor Barrett::: I couldn’t be more proud.,So excited::: as an ND 🍀alumna/parent and practicing attorney::: for this excellent choice to our Highest Court!! She will make her mentor::: Judge Scalia::: proud!,"A ""devout Catholic"" who didn't even mention::: let alone thank God; amazingly sad though an accurate representation of all things Notre Dame.","So many conservatives have filled the last few ND posts with comments predicting that ND and ""liberal"" Father Jenkins would not say anything nice if she were nominated. Another conspiracy theory unfounded.",As a born and raised Catholic::: I am disgusted by Notre Dames' president appearing at the White House without a mask. Now he is infected with COVID. He succumbed to politics and because of his action is a horrible example to his students. I wonder whom he has infected!,Let the dogma live loudly in us!! I can just imagine how jubilant Mommy is right now,Her judgment seems as equally poor as that of Fr Jenkins. If she cannot be trusted to wear a mask and follow simple guidelines to prevent the spread of COVID::: how can we trust her on other important issues?,On Saturday during the announcement of Amy Coney Barrett’s nomination to the Supreme Court at the White House Rose Garden::: Jenkins was seen without a mask::: shaking hands and flouting social distancing guidelines::: radio station 95.3 MNC reported.,Her conservative and antiquated first century Catholic ideology in the 21st century society is repugnant::: for this loyal ND fan! Embarrassing!,I have to question the character of UND in hiring people like Barrett (Ultra conservative platform and member of People Praise) to teach law and Margot Cleveland (who is a contributor toThe Federalist) in Business.,Sad to think how far ND has fallen since then. I’m disappointed in so many left wing::: anti American::: and anti Catholic diatribes on their part.,As irresponsible as the President of the United State and the President of Notre Dame::: no mask !! Poor leadership all the way a round!!,So proud of my fellow Notre Dame alum!,"From a (Practicing) Catholic family::: 2 uncles Jesuit priests::: one aunt a Mercy Nun ~ we are extremely disappointed (to say the LEAST) by Rev Jenkins BAD EXAMPLE ~ not much of a leader. RESIGN::: Rev Jenkins.
Your leadership is by omission of leadership. INo Mask)
And on the subject of Prof Barrett's nomination to US Supreme Court::: my family says BAD CHOICE.",I am a fan of Notre Dame. But I believe that the nomination should have been after the US election.,I am disgusted that Fr Jenkins was photographed at the ceremony yesterday in DC without a mask and without any efforts at physical distancing. The University has bet quite a bit on being able to safely have students on campus::: the football team cancelled a game to control a mini outbreak::: and Father Jenkins has already had to apologize once for being a poor example in terms of following the HERE guidelines. As a proud alum::: I am horrified by Jenkins’ failure of leadership. The lives of his students::: faculty::: staff and the south bend community are at stake. What an embarrassment. Fr Jenkins should immediately apologize to this community and announce plans for a 14 day quarantine.,Fr. John Jenkins::: C.S.C. should resign or forced to resign for his cavalier and ignorant actions at the White House. His excuse letter is hollow as a man leading a prestigious university should know that because you passed a quick screen does not mean you (or other participants) are not infected. His hypocrisy is disgusting.,Notre Dame University should be ashamed to have a president who thinks the virus is a hoax and who attended the Rose Garden ceremony with no mask and no social distancing::: catching COVID and then going back to the university to spread Covid to his staff and students! . Like Barrett::: he is a terrible example of what Jesus calls us to do- have empathy and regard for others . Science denying ::: hypocritical self absorbed ‘Catholics’ should not be leader of a university nor on the Supreme Court. I’m pleased that the students and their university newspaper are speaking out against these hypocrites. THEY BOTH SHOULD STEP DOWN.,What an incredible lack of leadership by the President of Norte Dame for not practicing what he preaches but more importantly by risking those around him by not wearing a mask or practicing social distancing. An esteemed institution of higher learning needs to lead with science and common sense. Your actions were not a simple mistake but a well planned act of ignorance. You should resign.,Couldn't be happier for Amy Coney Barrett and our country!!! I've been a ND fan my whole life. I am currently a proud mom of a Junior at ND. There have been plenty decisions made by President Jenkins that have been upsetting and embarrassing as a Catholic ND fan.... This decision to congratulate an extremely deserving SCOTUS candidate and ND alum and professor ...is not one of those times. Thank you Fr. Jenkins! GO IRISH!!!,Can’t understand why you are bragging instead of expressing shame that you kept this vile person employed for so long,"I suggest watching this video to get an better idea of how she approaches the law: https://
www.youtube.com/
watch?v=j0ZN532f
9d0",We will be praying for Nominee Barrett and her family.,"So great that her nomination event has become a COVID spreader event. ND should be so proud of the nonmask wearing example that she and President Jenkins have displayed. Religion has more and more demonstrated its function as causing fracturing::: division::: and hate...along with hypocrisy. They are great representatives
.","Sorry::: but having this person and the manner she is actively participating in her selection is NOTHING to brag about!

In fact; the idea that Notre Dame is involving itself in this mess is disheartening!

I have admired Notre Dame for 62 of my 70 years; no longer!",She represents the dogmatic side of ND. The dogmatic side of Christianity. Not the caritas side. Please::: no.🙏,"She did not believe that Justices should be appointed during an election year::: when it was President Obama. Yet here she is today.

This election has already begun. Many of us have voted. This is wrong.

I have issues with her Title IX decision with regard to the Purdue student. I want to know how the teaching about ""headship"" and being a member of a covenant community will affect her role in SCOTUS.

All that I know about her personally is good. But there are a lot of issues.",However Ms. Barrett and the President of the University sit maskless at the WH event. I love ND but really have to question the wisdom of both of these people. How safe are ND students with this lack of leadership?,She's way too young to join the Supreme Court because she doesn't have enough life experiences to draw on.,So irresponsible of President Jenkins to put this campus at risk. Be a leader not a follower,No game this week but the Irish got a win. Go Notre Dame,Quite a marvellous Lady... and legal mind...her religion has nothing to do with. Lots of muddled thinking about being conservative in legal interpretation approach and political view. If you think they are mixed::: you can be a legal advocate and Liberal Fascist. You are on two separate tracks. Very impressive legal thinker. Notre Dame is Lucky an surely proud of her. Strange though that the court is composed only of Catholic (save Episcopalian Gorsitch) and Jews). She is one smart and high integrity lady. Get your politics out of justice.,The University can congratulate alumni on being nominated::: but I feel it should not indicate whether or not an alum should be confirmed. And that goes for both conservative and liberal nominees.,"Is this the appropriate place to ask for the School to issue a statement about President Jenkins' irresponsible failure to maintain distance and to wear a mask while at the White House and thereby becoming covid-19 infected?
There was a shutdown of in-person classes when students were infected. What will happen to the senior administration of ND University?",And she is the next sitting justice. Thank God,I’m trying not to freak out. I’m on Obamacare! My pre-existing condition is that I had breast cancer 8 years ago. Never mind that at 64::: I’m healthier now than I’ve ever been. 😒,So Norte Dame a catholic university::: start acting like it!,"Complete and utter disgrace. She will use this seat to limit access to health care for the most vulnerable and roll back decades of progress for women::: LGBTQ::: and immigrants—just
to name a few. She does not represent the ND values I was taught. I am sickened and terrified. Does ND not care about the forthcoming harm to millions::: or that this entire nomination process is illegitimate? Shame.",People of Praise was formed in 1971 by Kevin Ranaghan and Paul DeCelles. Both men were involved in the Catholic Charismatic Renewal::: in which Pentecostal religious experiences such as baptism in the Holy Spirit::: speaking in tongues and prophecy were practiced by Catholics. In its early history::: it influenced the institutional development of the Catholic Charismatic movement in the United States and played important roles in national charismatic conferences.,How dare Jenkins attend a function at the WH not wearing a mask. Arrogance at it's best. Then how many people has he infected on his way home::: plus the people he works with at ND. Not to mention those who don't work there. What would the Pope say? He is a disgrace to the church and ND.,Outstanding choice!,Proud to have been her student while at ND as a visiting student!,She brought her entire family to a non mask wearing::: closely packed crowd of Covid carriers. Her children::: not wearing masks::: were inches from people we know to be infected. Tell me again about how great and pro life she is. What a joke.,Maybe you would like an Atheist - They have to follow the constitution not their religion!! Wise Up.,Well::: she certainly represents Notre Dame.,I’m so happy for Notre Dame and for America. And the mother of 7 school-age children... wow. She is the face of all that is great about our country.,Is it too late for me to encourage everyone to wear an f’in mask during the White House ceremony? Thanks😘,Regardless of whether or not you love her::: and regardless of whether or not she is qualified::: Notre Dame should not have made a statement until she is confirmed. Now::: by making this statement::: Notre Dame is supporting the hypocracy of McConnell::: who is reversing his previous position that there cannot be a Supreme Court nominee during an election year. Notre Dame is now supporting the principle that the ends can justify the means. Notre Dame is supposed to stand for doing what is right::: not this.,SO EXTREMELY PROUD OF YOU AMY STAY STRONG AS I KNOW YOU ARE WE GOT YOU ..GO IRISH. !!!!!! ❤,Go ☘️ Irish! Way to represent,Fantastic. A cause for pride in the heart of every Domer.,Read the constitution people ..... she’s getting in ! Like it or not,How many retro-Catholic oddballs do you have at Notre Dame?,"Have you ever read the Catechism:::Mary?
Esp paragraph 2272.",Wrong choice. 🤮😢,How Ignorant::: arrogant John I. Jenkins Not wearing a mask. Another idiot w/his fake apology now that he's been put on blast (called out).,"That’s incredible! To serve the country in that capacity? Wow::: amazing. May God bless her and guide her::: and may He take care of our country in Jesus’ mighty name::: Amen. 🇺🇸🙏🏼❤️

Go Irish!☘️",Outstanding choice! 💙💛,Terrible choice,Major concern about her being unbiased.,"Congratulations
Amy Coney Barrett! 🇺🇸🇺🇸☘️",This is wrong on so many levels. What a crappy thing to be prideful about.,Mr. Mosier::: maybe you need to stop being so biased! We are ND!,"Crazy to see so many “Catholics” bashing her.
Wow","Congratulations
and as a practicing Catholic I will pray that you are confirmed without cruelty.",The perfect choice!!!,What are you gonna fight for.,Why don’t the social justice Catholics speak up. She will destroy the ACA while so many people are contracting covid and need health care more than ever!,"President Jenkins MUST RESIGN. He is an utter disgrace to humanity::: and should perhaps be excommunicated as well. Disgusting!!!..

Your good name will be tarnished forever by promoting this evil person who is totally against what Jesus taught. She is against Pope Francis teachings . She is being nominated by a traitorous madman ::: so you are clearly showing your support for an illegitimate president and an illegitimate supreme court nominee. She refused to answer any questions during the nomination process and she felt entitled. When asked a simple question about whether she would support a peaceful transition of power::: she refused to answer.,"GOD

🍀🍀🍀",Are you kidding me?,It is not right to nominate someone now::: with the election so close::: we all know that in our heart of hearts. It will not lead to healing of the deep divide in this country -\-\ it will only serve to make it worse. If the current president wins a second term::: he can nominate her then. Be on the right side of history Notre Dame. Update: I expected more out of an ND crowd respond::: at the very least honest dialogue. I wasn't quoting the constitution. I wasn't ignoring what has or hasn't happened 29 times before. I wasn't pointing out the hypocrisy of either side::: though I do have an opinion about that. I wasn't commenting on whether the President or Senate have the legal right to take action. I was commenting on what is right for this country::: at this moment in time. What is prudent::: and measured::: and takes into consideration ALL Americans and the ultimate well-being of this fragile democracy::: more fragile now than at any time since the civil war. As we read yesterday::: to everything there is a time::: and my heart tells me that we need to enter the time of healing - her nomination is not that.,Freedom of religion?,🤮🤮🤮,Let’s see if Jenkins will put politics above Catholicism and attack ACB.,Yay so excited as an alum to have a woman nominated to the highest court in the land who is going to strip myself and other women of our reproductive rights and roll back protections for the lgbtq community including all my lgbtq friends I graduated with! So proud! 🙄What an absolute embarrassment.,Notre Dame graduate here. MTS 2001. I want to make sure Father Jenkins quarantines for the next 2 weeks after going mask-less and not ensuring safe social distancing today in DC. I look forward to the press release tomorrow.,Father Liberal Jenkins. Ha ha ha. Now what you going to do? Call Lou?,Im horrified by this nomination Woman get ready to set the clock back 100 years. Im literally sick over this,"Be very strong! The Congress is already coming after you in regard to your adopted children... TUNE THEM OUT!

Best wishes and God bless you!",Qualified or not::: her nomination is not an introduction at a pep rally before a big game. She's been nominated for the United States Supreme Court. She must be thoroughly questioned by the Senate before a vote can be taken. Her association with the University should not sway her selection either way.,"Let us hope that the “dogma that is strong in her” includes the Church’s opposition to the death penalty and commitment to racial and social justice such as support of the ACA. I suspect she is a “pick and choose” Catholic on those issues. I suspect that she will be an extreme judicial activist in overturning 50 years of established precedent on Roe and conveniently a strict constructionist
on social justice issues. In other words an intellectual hypocrite like Scalia.",I have no issue with any nominations. However either the process and the timeline remain the same or change for all. Spare me the but::: this is done constantly by both parties. I for one was sick of it years ago. Any lifetime appointment for a post initiated by politicians is a very bad joke. Change it to 20 years::: with allowances for reappointment and a mandatory retirement age or get rid of the sham it’s becoming.,"So unfortunate that her qualifications:::
intellect::: professionalism
and professional background won’t play a role in the political show trial that is coming.","If a judge were criticized for being an Orthodox Jew::: or an observant Muslim::: or - as former President Carter - a devoted::: religious Protestant::: wouldn't the outcry be deafening? But ""devout Catholic"" is now a filthy term? Miserere Mihi::: Domine!","The fact that Father Jenkins choose to attend and even then wear no face mask shows his exceedingly poor judgement. To endorse some one that may enable the overturning of the entire American republic; is ignoble
and inconsistent with everything I learned from Pope John Paul.","Being ""proud"" to have an alumnus of your alma mater being considered for SCOTUS is irrelevant. It is about ALL of us. Not just people like you. This nomination will change womens' lives forever::: not for the good. Government should have no say in what women's medical decisions are::: and if they can gain access to medical services that are affordable through Planned Parenthood or birth control. When men approve of the government mandating vasectomies and chemical resolutions to stop pregnancy::: and no coverage for ED medications::: then talk to us. She will also criminalize LBGTQ people and take away their rights::: as well as overturn the Affordable Care Act in the middle of a pandemic::: which is going to be before the court on Nov 10. So if you follow what Jesus says::: Love everyone then...WWJD????",So the President of Notre Dame has the coronavirus ..... it is what it is! 😁,"Notre Dame president tests positive for Covid-19 nearly a week after attending SCOTUS announcement with no mask https://

When a large crowd gathered::: with people from one town after another
journeying to Jesus::: he spoke in a parable.
“A sower went out to sow his seed.
And as he sowed::: some seed fell on the path and was trampled:::
and the birds of the sky ate it up.
Some seed fell on rocky ground::: and when it grew:::
it withered for lack of moisture.
Some seed fell among thorns:::
and the thorns grew with it and choked it.
And some seed fell on good soil::: and when it grew:::
it produced fruit a hundredfold.”
After saying this::: he called out:::
“Whoever has ears to hear ought to hear.”
Then his disciples asked him
what the meaning of this parable might be.
He answered:::
“Knowledge of the mysteries of the Kingdom of God
has been granted to you;
but to the rest::: they are made known through parables
so that they may look but not see::: and hear but not understand.
“This is the meaning of the parable.
The seed is the word of God.
Those on the path are the ones who have heard:::
but the Devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts
that they may not believe and be saved.
Those on rocky ground are the ones who::: when they hear:::
receive the word with joy::: but they have no root;
they believe only for a time and fall away in time of temptation.
As for the seed that fell among thorns:::
they are the ones who have heard::: but as they go along:::
they are choked by the anxieties and riches and pleasures of life:::
and they fail to produce mature fruit.
But as for the seed that fell on rich soil:::
they are the ones who::: when they have heard the word:::
embrace it with a generous and good heart:::
and bear fruit through perseverance.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A Statement from Fr. Jenkins on the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg:

“As we mourn the passing of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg::: I recall fondly her standing-room-only appearance in the Joyce Center in 2016. Combining intellectual rigor with playfulness and candor::: Justice Ginsburg discussed policy::: politics and the struggle for women to find their rightful place in the administration of justice. It was a personal privilege for me to take her on a tour of campus and witness her kindness and courtesy to everyone she met.

“Upon the death of her close friend and ideological opposite::: the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia::: Justice Ginsburg wrote a fitting epitaph for all who serve the law so well: ‘Toward the end of the opera Scalia/Ginsburg::: tenor Scalia and soprano Ginsburg sing a duet: “We are different::: we are one:::” different in our interpretation of written texts::: one in our reverence for the Constitution and the institution we serve.'”",9/19/2020 12:01,She did some good things but she was a pro-abortion::: a Catholic university should not praise her.,I second that motion - Father Jenkins tried to take away women’s access to birth control to hold them down and refuses to let a woman serve as a president of the university. You represent the exact problem she spent her life trying to fix.,Fr. Jenkins::: if you really respected her::: you would discontinue the requirement that a man must serve as president of our lady’s university.,This kind of thread is good - for helping me BLOCK all kinds of nuts (many of whom have no connection to ND at all...),could only hope there will be two fine people who can be as great as Ginsburg and Scalia.,Sorry::: you can't justify killing babies!!!,"""Unbecoming"" is murdering the unborn!",Such a great human being! Brilliant and kind.,Hatred ? Giving respectful comments .. grieving a great woman . Is what I read .,"RBG was an authentic person. Intellectually honest. She delivered for the values for which she was appointed::: unapologeticall
y liberal. I am hopeful we will see Amy Barrett for SCOTUS.","Is this a picture similar to Christ with the women at the well? Was he explaining to her to be friendly and civil to unborn children::: and that children are a blessing rather than a roadblock to women's ""advancement""?",A lovley tribute to a woman who undoubtedly was a wonderful woman to know personally::: as Justice Scalia::: her ideological opposite (and one of my personal heroes) knew so well. RIP.,A brilliant woman. But I cannot condone abortion. Sorry. My father. ND class ‘42. He rolling in his grave,She was indeed a great woman! Rest in peace !,What an honor Fr. Jenkins. You have been blessed.,If there is an irony it is that two of the most Catholic countries in the world—Ireland and Italy—now have amongst the most liberal abortion laws in the world.,Michael Ryan the lovely school president back at it again in full support of the baby killers,Of course::: nominate someone who is the absolute opposite of RBG Good grief🙄,An incredible woman!,she was one hell of a lady.. god bless her for being a champion.,I’m not gonna sugarcoat it the woman was evil she supported killing babies .,I respect pro life people. Problem is there’s so few of them around! I can only find people that are pro-birth. Post that event - the same people are pro-mass incarceration and pro poverty and pro subjugation.,I always liked her::: but now even more. Thank you for the narrative and great pic.,Being compassionate for someone’s death is respectful::: but I will not sing praise to someone who does not protect the unborn.,The most I will say at this point is that she was an extraordinary woman who did not allow profound disagreements to interfere with forming and nurturing meaningful friendships. I try (and sometimes fail) to live by the same standard. So::: although I disagreed with many of her decisions in the strongest terms possible::: I nevertheless respected her and hope that she rests in peace. I will pray for her soul and for her family in their grief.,"Where was Fr. Jenkins’ similar statement when Scalia died? #liberalpanderin
g",Her wish was not to appoint someone to take her place until after the election. Please grant her her wish!💕,How many of the votive candles in the grotto did she light for the murdered unborn?,Thank you::: Fr. Jenkins. We can always count on you to say just the right thing. She might have been small in stature but she was a giant of a woman. God bless her.,A great lady. She stood for us. May her replacement be just for all of us.,"Justice Ginsburg fought in the manner the Notre Dame Fighting Irish do - ""in a way that will lead others to join you."" Rest in Peace RBG.",My daughter is so grateful to have been in the audience that night.❤️,Religion and God’s law should always be before any laws of man!!!,Actually Barrett said the opposite,I think we should mourn a great woman before rolling out the hatred unbecoming to Notre Dame.,Somehow I don’t see Jenkins supporting the great Amy Coney Barrett.,She’s a professor at ND Law. He supports her now.,Thank you Father Jenkins! 🙏🙏🙏,"Love her epitaph here that she wrote in regards to Scalia/
Ginsburg!😍","No hating should be allowed on this thread
God allows for our imperfect selves to be blessed",An incredible lady has left a legacy for generations of ladies to aspire to. May we honor her for all she was::: wanted and expected from us. Thank you for sharing your thoughts.,.@JoeBiden must announce that if the GOP rushes to pack the Court::: the Dems will expand the SCOTUS to 11 justices::: and expand the lower federal courts by 70 to 100 new judgeships::: which have long been needed. In short::: he will depoliticize the federal judiciary!,"Any Coney Barrett would use the law and its implication of punishment—even
imprisonment—to
supplant the informed and examined consciences of individual women and their doctors. She would transfer the personal agency and free will of women to the state. No thanks.",If only we could all work together with people as she did.,RIP RBG. Your family meant a lot to the lives of many Americans as we continue to evolve 🙂 Go Irish! #myamhealth #alphaptdoc,I pray that her likely replacement::: Notre Dame graduate and prof Amy Coney Barrett::: is given the same opportunity to serve despite being Ginsburg’s ideological opposite. The attack on her Catholic faith over the coming weeks will highlight the intolerance of opposing views that divides this country.,What a sweet picture and such kind words from Fr Jenkins.,Will Jenkins support Amy Coney Barrett if she is nominated? She is a graduate of ND Law School. True colors are about to be exposed? Is Jenkins true Blue and Gold???,"If only the world would learn from Scalia/
Ginsburg.","An icon for women's rights and upholding the Constitution has now passed on to the next level on Rosh Hashanah. 🙏💔

Thank you for your decades of service but more importantly for being a voice when women were being silent so others could reign supreme. 💔😓🙏

I’m hopeful that President Trump will immediately nominate a true conservative who understands that our rights come from God and no authority in this country can take those rights from us.",I wonder::: Father Jenkins::: if you challenged her on stance on abortion during the visit?,She supported late term abortion. Just sayin.,No mention of her radical stance on the killing of the unborn by a supposedly Catholic university::: however. Shameful.,"she was not great- she supported the murder of millions of babies by abortion::: thought age of consent should be lowered to age 12::: supported bigomy::: legalized prostitution::: and taxpayers to fund abortions. really just a misguided::: sad::: leftist- part of the communist/
socialist clinton machine.",Kinda crazy ND would post a picture of a priest walking happily hand in hand with a woman who often leaned far away from Catholic teaching and into the areas of intrinsic evil.. if a priest was ever seen walking with Stalin::: Mao::: or Hitler::: I think it’s obvious the church wouldn’t post warm-hearted memories of that person with priests.. sure. She passed::: pray for her. But.. her stance on abortion alone.. not even mentioning others::: are enough to make this photo sickening to actual Catholics and other Christians who take their faith seriously. May be time for the University to stop pretending to be Catholic at this point.,Funny how catholics love a woman who is responsible for millions of babies being aborted.,RIP to the more than 30:::000:::000 innocent babies that were murdered during the decades that Ruth Ginsburg defended Pro-abortion Laws.

Because of her::: I could be called to do my civic duty and serve on a jury without being exempted on a count of being a woman. Because of her I grew up believing I had a claim to my personhood as an equally vested citizen of my country. These changes happened in my own lifetime. And yet::: my whole growing up::: so deeply effected by her efforts::: I never knew it was because of her and the countless clerks and lawyers she worked with arguing six of the most critical cases affecting women and families the Supreme Court had yet heard.

For if the dead are not raised::: neither has Christ been raised:::

"When a wildfire brokeout in Mati::: Greece::: in the midst of a heatwave in 2018::: Architecture professor Michael Lykoudis sprang into action. In 2019::: he took a group of fifth-year architecture students to the seaside town to assess the damage and determine how to improve the town’s resiliency in the face of future emergencies::: while keeping its beauty and traditional architecture.

Today::: as deadly fires burn millions of acres across the western United States::: American communities will also need to make changes in order to prevent future dangers.

“I was moved to assist the people of Mati in their time of need::: but recent events have shown us that wildfires are an increasing threat to people around the world from Australia to California and beyond:::” Lykoudis says. “In addition to taking action to mitigate the effects of climate change::: we should reimagine vulnerable communities in ways that both enhance quality of life for the community and increase the fire resilience of the built environment.”

"Compassion in medicine is more than kindness and cheerful bedside demeanor. It has four distinct components: You have to notice suffering::: be moved by it::: want to do something about it::: and act capably.

At Notre Dame::: Professor Dominic Vachon and the Hillebrand Center for Compassionate Care in Medicine at Notre Dame are applying the science of compassion to help better educate and equip doctors to withstand the trials of the job.

In the Chicago Tribune:

Holtz must be added to a long list of disappointing white coaches (see Ditka::: Mike) and players (see Urlacher::: Brian) whose proximity to Black players and teammates did nothing to open their minds or hearts. In Holtz’s case::: as a college coach::: he made fortunes off the unpaid labor of mostly Black players.

And he has greatly disappointed at least some of them.
“We feel as though the hero we loved and adored::: that we would run through a brick wall for::: died in front of our eyes on Wednesday night:::” former Notre Dame receiver Bobby Brown::: who played for the Irish from 1996-99::: said while hosting his web show::: “Ball Hog Sports Talk.” “We have literally shed tears because of it. It seems as though you’ve abandoned us based on your alignment with a man who is at least very sympathetic to racists::: if he’s not a racist himself.”","I'm amazed that they're still playing. https://

“Fr. Jenkins why must you feel the need to clarify Coach Lou’s comments? He was phenomenal & speaks more as a true Catholic & the values we hold dear than your university.

"“While Coach Lou Holtz is a former coach at Notre Dame::: his use of the University’s name at the Republican National Convention must not be taken to imply that the University endorses his views::: any candidate or any political party.

Moreover::: we Catholics should remind ourselves that while we may judge the objective moral quality of another’s actions::: we must never question the sincerity of another’s faith::: which is due to the mysterious working of grace in that person’s heart.

In this fractious time::: let us remember that our highest calling is to love.” - Notre Dame President Fr. John Jenkins on remarks by former Coach Lou Holtz at the Republican National Convention",8/27/2020 19:40,We are committed to free speech and the free sharing of ideas and opinions on our Facebook page::: however::: we want to remind those commenting that we reserve the right to remove comments unrelated to this conversation and those that include personal attacks and profanity.,Lou gave a wonderful speech that ND should be proud to have associated with the university. Brings them back to the values they should be espousing,Proud alumni Class of ‘95 and not so proud of coach Lou. He should have just focused on his candidate’s strengths and character if he wants to speak like a “true” catholic. Pero allí está pintado- no puede. 🤷🏻‍♀️,As long as Biden and the rest of the Democratic Party is in favor of abortion::: they are at odds with the teaching of Catholic doctrines on the meaning of life.,I love Coach Holtz! I respect him as a Catholic Christian & appreciated his comments! Notre Dame our mother::: pray for us!,Loved Lou and the Military MD that became Nun..great speech by both,"I watched the presentation by Coach Holtz::: and did not see or hear him invoke the University in his remarks. Somebody is a bit touchy today.

PS - isn't this obvious attempt to ""cancel"" the remarks made by the Coach a bit hypocritical?",The expectation is for ND to represent authentic Catholicism and fidelity to the Magisterium while encouraging those values in the public sphere. That’s exactly what the speech last night represented.,This statement is not needed and would not have even been made if Lou Holtz made a speech at the DNC.,Why feel the need to make this statement? No where in his speech did he say he represented the University. It is clear that this intended to let everyone know where the university stands. I’m sorry father::: but Shame on you! This is why we are losing people to the faith.,So UND wants to play the political BLM game::: but when a respected Coach::: who has not been on your payroll for decades gives his own views::: you want to distance yourself? Shame on you UND. I am losing respect for this University everyday.,"It’s a shame to see what has happened to Lou Holtz. He was a great coach. I would hope that he could slip into old age more gracefully::: without destroying his well-earned legacy.

This is yet another reminder::: though::: that we should never look up to men::: who are intrinsically flawed. We should admire and respect the talents that they exhibited::: but beyond that::: remember that they are just men.","I’d like to see A Catholic University act like A Catholic University.

I was proud by his speech and respect him a lot more than the current UN President.",Thank you for the statement. It is horrifying to think any one person would publicly disparage another person’s faith at a political convention (or anywhere). The behavior in and of itself is unbecoming of a retired football coach.,The fact that you needed to post this is disgraceful. That’s OK Father Jenkins we all know who you’re voting for and who you wish to see as president.,"We love and we care about all people of faith. We are free to love those who may not agree with where the wind blows and more than anything we need to judge based on that persons character and Lou Holtz is a great man and has helped many young men succeed in life and find their niche.
We must remain focused on God::: Country and Notre Dame. Our condolences to Coach Holtz and his family for the recent loss of his wife who loved Notre Dame equally. Freedom of speech is a US constitutional right and we must never be afraid to speak.
#alphaptdoc

God bless all The Fighting ☘️ Irish",Thank you::: Fr. Jenkins. It is for God to judge::: not Lou. Neither political party represents all Catholic viewpoints and people need to discern for themselves.,The University should start listening to Coach Holtz...,Free speech but putting liberal ideals on that campus is wrong with the beliefs of our Catholic faith,Lou’s speech last night was dynamite and on point. I like BK::: but Lou will forever be my Notre Dame head coach.,Lou never looked more insane than last night. Guess that means he fits in at the RNC. Glad to see ND distance themselves from him and his statements.,The issue is not even political . It is truth vs lies competence vs incompetence . Decency vs vulgarity good vs evil . Shame on Lou Holtz .,Thankyou for saying that. I've always respected Notre Dame::: but not this man anymore. Can't believe he has these views. Also::: just fyi::: most modern day catholics do not support the current president.,I think Professor Pete Buttigieg of the University of Notre Dame should also weigh in on the need for political objectivity at the University...,Lou is no longer relevant in this world. Too bad he ended up being a joke.,He said what Notre Dame should have said.,Why make this statement.. by doing so you just picked a side🥴,The fact that you even posted this clearly shows your political stance 🤷🏻‍♂️,Well said Father! Thank you,Lou is losing it...several weeks ago he compared the risks of storming the beaches at Normandy to playing college football.,Thank you for your words!! I was horrified to think that University of Notre Dame would side with Lou Holtz.,No longer a fan of Lou Holtz::: and I'm not even Catholic. But I am a Domer::: Class of 1999.,It's be nice if ND took the same care to distance themselves from Pete Buttigieg's campaigning for Biden::: even as he's been appointed as a fellow at the University 🙄,THIS is just one of the reasons I love Notre Dame. THANK YOU.,It says you don’t endorse any political party::: but by this lost it is obvious what party you do endorse. If you truly don’t endorse a political party you didn’t need to make this statement,"God bless Lou Holtz and God bless Donald Trump. Trump is the only candidate to be unapologeticall
y pro-life. This year’s democratic ticket has not only endorsed abortion::: including late-term abortion::: they have celebrated as states have expanded the boundaries of their liberal abortion laws.

I have watched in quiet horror as the University that I have so loved and been so proud to be an alum (ND 88) of::: has drifted so far from its former conservative Catholic ideals. I will be quiet no more.

I stand in opposition of ND’s newfound liberal slant and stand firmly behind Coach Holtz and President Trump.",Looks like it’s time for A new University President.,Lou Holtz is right though 🤷🏻‍♀️,So ashamed of UND. They have totally lost their Catholic identity. I used to love visiting to renew my faith.😢,Tread lightly ND...Lou coached some of the greatest ND athletes to national championships. Love Lou! Love ND! Not surprised at ND’s treatment of Lou...look how he was pushed out of the university. AWFUL! Lou::: you’re an outstanding human being. My sympathy on the passing of your wife. God bless! Is ND thinking of changing name & not associating with the blessed mother & Catholicism anymore? I would not be shocked..2020 is wild,Not me. I was extremely proud of his comments and association with ND. The University is becoming too liberal.,Well said Fr. John Jenkins. Thanks for issuing this statement.,Shame on Notre Dame smearing one of your greatest coaches in a thinly veiled attack on our President I have relatives in South Bend who support President Trump you just smeared them also! I am a proud supporter of President Trump and lifelong Notre Dame fan from Maryland you should be ashamed! God Bless Coach Holtz! God Bless President Trump! 🇺🇸,Wonder if the University would come out saying the same thing if he spoke at the DNC?? 🤔🤔 highly doubtful.,Afraid your big money will dry up.,I loved his comments. Why is this post necessary?,Personally I enjoyed Coach Holtz's remarks - spoken like a true Catholic.,"WELL STATED FR. JENKINS!!
SO PROUD OF YOUR LEADERSHIP OF OUR UNIVERSITY.
JCC ND 61","Never heard ""Catholic in Name Only"" used during undergrad",Like you all covered everything up on stage when his greatness Obama spoke there.. get over it...,Lou continues to be an embarrassment these days. Better to just disavow him completely.,"Disappointed in Fr. Jenkins. Not the first time though. Maybe your highest calling is to live out our Catholic teachings and not constantly try to “fit” into the secular world. Lou Holtz used the University’s name the way it should be used. As a Catholic institution that believes in the sanctity of life for the unborn. It’s unfortunate that Notre Dame doesn’t stand for Catholic teachings but rather try to recruit these new age kids to show “diversity.”We should be confident in our Catholic teachings #disappointedalu
mni",But allowing the sports programs and promoting blm is ok? They want to destroy the nuclear family and remove God from everything. Lou has a right to his personal opinion and to display his resume! You can’t cancel culture a person that doesn’t care about standing firm on his religious and moral beliefs! How can any person agree with the democrats platform and support them and call themselves Catholics??? Notre dames God has become the almighty dollar! I can’t wait to see what else they denounce when the leftist loonies put pressure on them to betray their faith! I think I hear the rooster crowing Judas!,This admonition from the institution that bestowed the hallowed Laetare Medal on Joe Biden is ...rich.,"Holtz invoked Notre Dame's name in his speech to support an administration that attacks people of color and the less fortunate.

Thank you for this statement. I know it'll get you some criticism::: but it's the right thing to do.",Fr. Jenkins ALL Catholics should support the Right to Life and that all Life begins at conception until natural death. Coach Holtz is the epitome of a Catholic when he speaks. VP Biden says in his personal life he's for life::: yet on the public stage he is pro choice. As Catholics we are in or out. Our moral convictions we must wear on our sleeves. We cannot speak out of both sides of our mouth to appease the masses! This is what VP Biden does. If Catholics at all ages choose to support pro choice over pro life they ARE NOT CATHOLIC!!,Alright how many of you: 1. Attended the university. 2. Attended the university when there were actually admissions standards.,Lou is a de facto ambassador of our brand::: if you will. I don’t have a problem with anyone from the University taking a stand or position on an “issue”::: but stay clear of any candidates. I feel the same way about Pompeo’s appearance. Issues not candidates or parties. Lou can express his opinions::: but chose your venue with more care.,What a joke. Get back to infecting the kids,I’ve been reading many of these comments::: and I find it interesting that none that I’ve seen so far have addressed the values that Holtz discussed: trust::: commitment::: and love. I was beyond disgusted to hear him invoke ND’s name and suggest that our Dear Leader embodies any of them. We’re talking about a pathological liar (I believe 20K lies documented since he took office) who is committed to no one but himself. Did he show love to the DREAMERs he falsely promised to protect? To the peaceful protestors he tear gassed? To the children he ripped away from their parents? To the generations::: especially minorities and low-income people::: who will suffer the health consequences of his environmental degradation? To the asylum seekers who he has forced into extremely unsafe and unsanitary conditions in Mexico? To the seriously ill Americans whose healthcare he tried to take away? Please::: Lou::: don’t pretend the president shows even a shred of these values::: and PLEASE::: fellow Catholics::: stop closing your eyes to all of these issues when you decide who is and who isn’t “pro-life.”,I simply don't understand how people can be so supportive of Mr. Trump. He only began to oppose abortion when it was politically convenient for him. He has belittled so many people. He has been caught in so many lies. He has separated children from their families. He has fiddled while a virus has spread throughout the country. I look at the whole picture::: not just one issue. To me he is totally the antithesis of good moral values. Sorry Coach Holtz::: your endorsement was a disappointment.,Holtz says he believes in 3 things: trust::: commitment::: and love. we can now trust that he is committed to loving a racist. he’s proven to be another old white man who is completely out of touch with contemporary America.,Who else thinks it’s time for Jenkins to go?? First painting over Columbus::: now making excuses for Biden on his essentially infanticide stance on abortion.,If Barack Hussein Obama stated in a speech that he was awarded an honorary law degree from Notre Dame and in the same speech he also stated he was going to produce more funding for abortions::: would Notre Dame put out a similar statement separating themselves from BHO? I highly doubt it.,Joe Biden has spent his entire political life advocating in favor of abortion. The objective moral quality of that action is a mortal sin in the eyes of the Church.,What a totally unnecessary statement. Coach Holtz in no way suggested he was representing our University. It’s disheartening that Father Jenkins feels the need to distance himself from a message that affirms the sanctity of life.,"Loved Lou’s speech last night!
Lou Holtz was a coach full of character and integrity::: who wasn’t afraid to stand firmly on his convictions and beliefs.",I loved everything Lou said. Shame on ND for not backing their faith and allowing liberals to drive your thought,Thank you::: Father Jenkins. As a parent of a current student::: and a family of faith::: we appreciate your reminder that we shouldn’t be judging others’ faith::: but rather living by Jesus’ commandment to love.,He’s been irrelevant for many many years.,Coach Holtz spoke for thousands of alumni/a. The incorrect abortion and communistic views of John Jenkins have almost ruined Notre Dame. He has systematically and defiantly inserted his personal agenda into all aspects of the University . He and his conspirators on the board of trustees should resign or fired.,"Aren’t Catholics prolife?
Fr. Jenkins::: which direction are you leading?","Thank you father Jenkins. I was disheartened by the Holtz endorsement and am relieved to hear you are not aligning with it. As Mayor Pete commented::: Trump’s conduct “flies in the face of every notion::: liberal and conservative::: of basic morality and decency.” It is simply “jarring” to me that people “rooted in faith and scripture” would support Trump 😰. ☘️💚
What would Jesus do?",Lou gave an outstanding speech. God Bless him. We need to restore our country::: to love one another::: not let abortions continue. I thought UND taught these ideas in the class as a Catholic School.,Lou questioned someone’s faith. There is simply no excuse for that no matter who you support or what your views are.,Too bad Notre Dame doesn’t ban Pro Choice politicians from speaking on campus.,LOVE LOU! GO IRISH!🍀🙏💙,Andy Vierhile oh please. Your hypocrisy knows no bounds. Trump is responsible for so many children torn from their families. I witnessed it myself in my hometown.,Shame on you Father Jenkins! Are we no longer a Catholic University? Are you pro-choice too? Must be given your condemnation of Coach Lou and your support of Mayor Pete/Sleepy Joe! You should not be wearing your liberal politics on your sleeve for all the world to see!,Are you Catholic? Have you read the catechism of the church? We need more like Lou Holtz. You should be really proud of his appearance in the RNC.You could be really proud that in representing ND he is representing the church,"I agree with everything you said. ND should of kept their thoughts to themselves. If it wasn’t for Lou winning all those games ND would be nothing and wouldn’t get the players they get today.What happened to
ND’s Catholic values ? Instead if disparaging Coach Holtz ND should be giving him an honorary degree for his remarkable advocacy of CATHOLIC values.",As a Catholic university::: Notre Dame should follow conservative ways::: as liberals support abortion and other issues that are questionable.,You should applaud someone who stands up for what he believes regardless of the groupthink that is dominating our culture these days. His virtues are clear and ND should be ashamed of its virtue signaling with this statement by the President.,Notre Dame has long ceased to be a Roman Catholic University. It has ceased to stand by the Church's teaching on abortion::: homosexuality::: and the sanctity of marriage. It is either too cowardly or has given in to the new secular ideology that has permeated every level of the Roman Catholic hierarchy. It pains me and I will pray that it one day returns to its true mission - teaching our young while giving glory to God.,If Biden doesn’t follow the teachings of the Catholic faith then he is Catholic in name only. If you don’t want to follow the tenants of the Catholic faith fine::: but don’t call yourself a Catholic then. That’s not judging his heart or soul. It is judging his actions which we are all called to do.,Lou only anecdotally mentioned Notre Dame twice (a place he loves and can barely get through a conversation without mentioning). He didn’t imply that his views were the University’s. Putting out this statement was out was unnecessary.,Notre Dame is no longer a Catholic university::: so get over it. Under Jenkins::: it’s become a private college with a religion department. Hence::: I’m surprised Jenkins even has an opinion of this.,If Lou had criticized Republican individuals::: would a similar message have been issued by the University?,Last I checked::: Coach Holtz is allowed in the USA to have an opinion::: and voice it. Believe that's the First Amendment. He never said his ideals are Notre Dame's. Coach has led a life which is the American Dream. He was simply illustrating it::: which::: should be a powerful example for others. The University should stay impartial::: and not take either side in this debate. Again::: under our privileges living in the USA::: all are allowed to voice their own opinions and thoughts. Personally::: I commend Coach and applaud his willingness to share his story ☘️🇺🇸☘️🇺🇸☘️,"TY Fr. Jenkins for taking the high road!
Unfortunately Coach Holtz did not.. To question the “Catholicism “ of another person is not right::: especially while defending someone so distasteful is very disturbing... Bless your courage! ND will survive & so will you.☘️🙏👏🇺🇸",Why is it even necessary to make this statement? We are Americans with freedom of speech. It is in truth a slap in the face if the coach.,This is disgusting that ND comes out to react to Holtz’s comments rather than maybe make no statement and at least try to appear to remain impartial.,"Very surprised at this post. For ND to even think we are that stupid to believe that Lou’s comments represent them is offensive to me.
By the way::: I LOVED Lou’s speech and comments. He’s a class act as he’s always been. He’s very wise and doesn’t beat around the bush::: tells it just the way it is.
Miss you Lou!!!!
🍀🇺🇸🍀",Freedom of speech .... just because you didn’t like what Lou said you can’t get mad and cancel him! Love Lou and by the way he wasn’t the only one who questioned Biden’s faith.,Clearly in all fairness a disclaimer like this was also posted when you invited President Obama to give the commencement address years back. Oh wait! 🧐,"Indoctrination.
Catholics and all religions and non religious people can think for themselves.
Goodbye Notre Dame. 50 years of being a fan is enough. See i thought for myself.","It is good when a Catholic speaks out publicly about their faith.

This is what we are taught and believe.

Kudos to Lou.",ND had zero problem when he went on speaking engagements before and told stories about his time at ND. You’ve benefitted from him for years and now you do this. Shame on you for not allowing people to have a different opinion. That’s the society we live in now and it appears you support also.,I love Lou Holtz exactly the way he is. He is genuine and not full of it like the biased media as a follower or member of the sheople 🐑,Yes::: I think we are all aware of ND’s very liberal views. Fr Jenkins makes it quite obvious. It’s a source of great sadness to me- a 3rd generation ND family. How this happened I will never know or understand.,Coach is a true American your school is nothing but pathetic now,Hard to think of a person who has done more for a university. Coach holtz has the right to say whatever he wants to say. Would be great if the university millions love around the world would stick to their moral standards!,I would much rather listen to Coach Holtz mention Notre Dame at the RNC than the embarrassment it would bring speaking stories the DNC... I loved his speech!,I do not understand why the University felt it was necessary to react to Coach Holz’s passing reference to the fact some folks may know him as a former coach at Notre Dame. He mentioned several past achievements and then went on to speak from his heart on Catholic values. Politics aside—in no way did he suggest his views were those of Notre Dame any more than the very impressive Army MD/nun suggested her views were those of her Order or the Church. Both made it very clear they spoke from the heart about their personal experiences and beliefs. The fact that they did so in a political forum is irrelevant. When I share the fact I am an ND graduate when I occasionally speak publicly there is never a suggestion that I speak for the University and Coach Holz did not do so last evening.,Why does it matter if mentioned he coached at Norte Dame?Everyone already knew it. I am happy he spoke out::: more people need to. Norte Dame needs to get over their self. It’s no longer a Catholic university they have made that very apparent.,"I had to listen again to hear how he used the University's name. He merely mentioned that he has a statue at Notre Dame upon which are the words Trust/
Compassion/
Love::: and proceeded to opine on the lessons of those words as he interprets them. I think a lot of the negativity here toward Fr. Jenkins is that I don't recall him ever opining about whether life begins at conception. He seems to avoid the subject::: which offends many Catholics.",So Notre Dame feels s need to distance itself from it's formet coach BUT is OK with a former VP ans supposive Catholic running for President that is pro abortion???And whose running mate cane out against the Knights of Columbus. Maybe just maybe you all need to find out what you really stand for and what you want for America.,"Congratulations
to Coach Lou for being awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Trump. Congratulations
Coach Lou and thank you for sticking to your moral compass even when others distance themselves from you from doing so. I remember when Notre Dame was a true Catholic University.",He is acting more “Catholic” by doing this then the university is. Notre Dame has disappointed me immensely in our Catholic faith,"I would hope that the university would support his life-affirming:::
positive::: and responsible comments. He frequently gives a similar version of this speech to orgs around the country including the university’s prestigious NROTC. ⚓️ I appreciate the school’s desire to remain neutral::: however::: now is exactly the time for bold and courageous leadership. In reality::: Fr. Jenkin’s comments are undoubtedly a response to liberal complaints. Th Trump administration has made huge strides in the effort for worldwide peace::: especially in the Middle East; kept the US out of wars; fought for free speech as anarchists riot and intimidate;and has fought like no other to end abortion. Perhaps the school would do well to listen to the nun who also spoke at the RNC convention and be pro life *and* pro eternal life.",Did you offer a similar explanation when you covered up all identifiers of Catholicism when Obama visited?,Sure do miss the leadership of Monk and Hesburgh... this guy Jenkins has got to go.,Sorry you felt the need to raise a defensive posture instead of being proud of ND.,"Wow. With all the socialist crap that your professors spew in the classroom...you
feel you need to apologize for Lou Holtz professing his faith and his personal::: political preference? It’s perfectly clear which party the University leadership endorses...or this statement would not have been felt to be necessary. Holtz is a man of character::: integrity::: and morals. He holds to the tenets of our shared faith::: and honors Our Lady::: who took the difficult path and enabled our saving. It would be nice if Jenkins and the current leadership would have half so much fortitude and faith.","While I do believe that it’s each person’s right to decide who they will vote for in November::: I’m
in total shock & disbelief that a Catholic University doesn’t support life from time of conception! Abortion::: allowable until BIRTH::: by some people::: is MURDER in the eyes of my GOD!",So ND hiring “Mayor Pete” to join the faculty shouldn’t mean you agree with HIS political views either - Right? Maybe ND should put out that statement as well!,"I doubt that anyone with a brain assumed that Coach Holtz was speaking for anyone other than himself. Objectively speaking::: when one's political life demonstrates a constant disregard for the Church's teaching on life issues and religious liberty::: it's not a stretch to characterize such a person's practice of the faith as ""in name only"" and ""sincerely"" in error. Jenkins confusion is understandable:::
since he invited Obama to speak::: but not Trump.",Shame on ND. Lou Holtz has every right to support whom he chooses. As a Catholic::: I expect better from a Catholic University.,"Will there be a similar disclaimer for active faculty? https://

We could use an example like that in our nation.,Fr. Jenkins needs to be cancelled. This statement is idiotic and unnecessary. When we can't use ND in the same sentence as a way to describe our identity or life's work::: we have gone too far.,I’m glad to see my University comment on Lou Holtz’s comments at the RNC. It was disturbing to listen too.,Father Jenkins - What is the purpose of this post? Is Notre Dame now restricting when its name can be referenced in some kind of Orwellian speech code? Did Father Hesburgh ever try to restrict people from referring to Ronald Reagan as “The Gipper:::” his well earned Notre Dame nickname? You should be preparing an invitation to the most Pro-Life President in our nation’s history to come speak at Notre Dame::: not issuing disclaimers for when a former octogenarian football coach respectfully references our great University. Make Notre Dame Great Again!,I applaud Coach for his heartfelt statement at the Convention. No one in America::: including Father Jenkins::: could have been confused regarding whether Coach was speaking for himself. Looks more like a contrived excuse for Father Jenkins to be able to issue his own statement.,I expect you to invite the new president to speak at Notre Dame::: especially if it is Trump. He should of done one speech already for our students. We are ND! We are proud of the president of the United States!,"We get it. Notre Dame hates Republicans. Notre Dame is all about diverse views::: unless they are Republican. Notre Dame supported killing unborn children to keep a tradition alive inviting first year Presidents to give the commencement address::: but they decided to not invite Trump.
Prove me wrong ND::: since you are censoring this page.",Overreaction. Didn’t once think ND endorsed his thoughts. But it’s a fact - he did coach there.,Fr. Jenkins::: Thank you for reminding students of this central message of our Notre Dame Catholic traditions. It was in the spirit of ND's esteemed president Father Theodore Hesburgh. Some alum seem to have forgotten,I stand with Lou. Notre Dame is becoming a liberal college. So much for faith based values.,That’s was shocking. His name alone reflects ND. He should say nothing political. The university should make their coaches and professors sign something that says they will stop politicizing their position for life! It’s just wrong!,This in the light that a platform was provided for a pro abortion president to give the commencement address at the extreme disapproval of the Fort Wayne/South Bend dioceses bishop. Great speech Lou!,Lou Holtz indeed spoke about love in his speech and wasn't judging anyone. He was sharing his observations and perspective. Isn't that what America and Notre Dame are supposed to be about???,"For all those asking how he used the university’s name in his comments and decrying that he surely did not: ""I used to ask our athletes at Notre Dame::: 'If you did not show up who would miss you and why?'"" Holtz::: 83::: said. ""Can you imagine what would happen to us if President Trump had not shown up in 2016 to run for president? I'm so glad he showed up."" Oh::: Lou. Yes::: I can vividly imagine what would have happened if he had not showed up. Love::: a Lou-era alum and proud Pete campaign donor ❤️🍀🌈","Father Jenkins::: that’s exactly what Lou is saying::: he doesn’t know Joe Bidens heart or his unique faith::: but supporting him supports his actions of abortion::: and how can one continuously talk about how important his faith is but go against the core teachings of the faith. Mr. Biden has let the secular views of this nation to override what he should know is a good::: right and true moral teaching. And one can only speculate that his motive would be to secure a vote. It’s unconscionable.


Maybe you should reflect deeper on the character and integrity of Lou Holtz and what his message was intended to do.",Why would you endorse a party that supports abortion up to the moment of birth?,Anonymity::: while a battle for life v. abortion is waging::: seems a bit deafening to the ears of those in equal teachings and similar faith. Quite disappointing ND.,"There is still right and wrong. This is not political. But the ends don’t justify the means.

Trump lies::: cheats on his wives::: threatens anyone against him::: solicits foreign governments::: covers up cheating and lying with fixers::: and got impeached.

There is right and wrong. ND continues to stand behind right.",Notre Dame should be stripped of the ability to call itself Catholic. You guys obviously don’t adhere to the teachings of the church::: so why continue the lie?,"Why doesn't the University speak out against the democrats and their ""love"" for abortion.",Thank you::: University of Notre Dame!! I have lost faith in Lou Holtz but not in ND. What happened to this brilliant motivational speaker and coach? I couldn’t believe I was hearing right with what he was saying. It doesn’t seem possible.,"The only mention of Notre Dame was when he mentioned his statue::: referring to the three words inscribed on it::: Trust::: Commitment::: and Love. How could you possibly infer that he was attempting to represent the University? Lou Holtz is a great man. There was no need for a statement like this. Do you feel the need to qualify the remarks of other previous coaches or faculty members every time they speak publicly? Why now?

Do better Notre Dame.",Lou did not in any suggest or imply that Norte Dames endorses his views. He only said he coached at ND- he’s allowed to say that right? Even though he is a Republican? Father Jenkins comments are silly and unnecessary::: and I think he had to really struggle to find a reason to make them by suggesting something no one in their right mind would find was implied. It is sadly telling Father Jenkins had to make such a stretch of logic and reason in order to criticize Lou Holtz. He should have just let it go. Lou is entitled to his opinions and to express them publicly. Father Jenkins pastoral tone is a sham- such pastoral counseling should be done in private::: if called for. It was cheap shot::: beneath Father Jenkins and beneath the University. I am embarrassed for ND::: but unfortunately not surprised. The last thing ND wants is to be associated with good Catholics. God help us.,Proud of Fr. Jenkins telling about honor that is more important that winning political fighting. He is saying what Jesus would say. That is what i expect from the leaders of Notre Dame.,UND::: I have been a lifelong fan::: but your continually leftist::: liberal::: anti-Catholic beliefs are disturbing.

Does not make sense to me.,He had every right to speak last night::: but the fact is::: the person Lou spoke about and is in support of is not remotely in line with ND/Catholic ethics/values.,Of course::: why would a catholic institution support a president that includes God in every speech and wants to bring back God into America and the school system. You're not fooling anyone ND.,One party supports public funding of abortion on demand and a movement whose leaders encourage people to destroy statues of Jesus and Our Lady. The other party ends their convention with Christopher Macchio singing Ave Maria::: God Bless America and America the Beautiful. What would you fight for? We know where Father Jenkins lands.,I’ve loved Lou almost my whole life::: & the words he said are beyond disappointing to say the least. I can’t wrap my head around it. I’m glad Fr Jenkins spoke out.,"We have reached strange times when the university feels compelled to make a statement such as this. A former coach and legend of Notre Dame is the reason you have such a large and consistent fan base. If you dont like making political statements.....
never mind. This IRISH fan is about done.",I am an avid Notre Dame football fan. I am not of the Catholic persuasion. That being said::: I was disgusted what I was hearing from Lou last night. I think it is high time for him to saddle up and ride off into the sunset. It's best for Notre Dame to part ways with Lou.,Most people know who Lou Holtz is/was::: the last head coach at ND to win a National Championship in Football. That being said::: I at no time linked anything he has ever said to be from UND::: most people are smart enough to know the difference. It saddens me that ND felt that they had to make this statement when it was obvious that Lou Holtz was talking as a private person and not a representative of ND. Will ND also come out with a statement every time an alumni or other former coaches::: etc. speaks publicly about a subject that ND finds questionable::: to include comments on their post.,Heaven forbid the university appear to support a pro life pro family candidate.,And Coach's legal obligations to ND ended when he left. He will always be a former great ND coach as the statue of him at ND affirms.,"This makes no sense

You see whats going on::: how people are being treated::: how he disrespected all three of his wives to say the least::: and you write a measly statement saying his views are not the views of Notre Dame?

We need to look up to those trying to make the world a better place. Sports makes bars a lucrative business.

God's grace far surpasses ours. I watched every minute of his interview::: found nothing offensive::: and he only stated his own views::: not claiming you as the author or endorser.

Being politically correct to please our audience::: is actually denying a wonderful relationship you had with this delightful coach for years. He did nothing wrong. Like everyone else your University he has opinions. I found him down to earth::: common sense::: loving and thoughtful.

I am so glad I got to watch him and hear his thoughts. He has a lot of wisdom to offer::: sage wisdom. We need those kinds of people in our lives. Godly men who are unafraid to take a stand for what they believe in rather than bowing to the crowd to get along.

I am remembering that verse: For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. Romans 3:23 There is not one person reading this that is not sinful and forgiven only by the grace and mercy of a almighty God who loved us so much he gave his only begotten son as a atonement for our sins.

34 A new commandment I give to you::: that you love one another::: even as I have loved you::: that you also love one another. 35 By this all men will know that you are My disciples::: if you have love for one another.” John 13:34-35

This is a disgrace and demonstrates the absolute failure you have become. It is time for Notre Dame to remove their association with Catholicism because you are NOT a Catholic university.

There are grave consequences if my children do not stop murdering. God is the creator of life. He alone has the right to call souls home.

When asked.. “What if you don’t know or they change while in office?”

Mary responded::: “Then you will be held accountable for what you know at the time of your decision.”

At the same mass where Mary appeared::: Jesus Christ followed... “Abortion is murder.” Jesus repeated these words several times and then said::: “As you murder the life of the most innocent::: you are murdering the life of your very soul.

The Root of Christianity ! I’m pretty sure Jesus was pro life!!! 🤷‍♀️,"This should not be said by a Catholic Priest at a Catholic University‼️
Fake Catholic’s don’t believe abortion is Murder 🤷‍♀️God will hold them accountable if they vote for Biden!🥺Horrifying to hear you admit to polluting our young minds with extreme Left Liberal views ‼️I’m offended .
Lou Holts worked there he was a good coach . He spoke the truth about abortion !",He was such a iconic hero to me. No longer. I am devastated that he would be a spokes person for Trump. And not because of Trump's political platform of the day but because of his character which seems so opposite of coaches. A dark moment for this ND fan and Saint Mary's grad.,How can Catholics like the democratic party and the killing of innocent babies? You're not just voting for a man::: you're voting for the parties ideals::: and I thought most Catholics would be against murder?,I am glad he spoke in support of true Catholic Church teaching.,So You support abortion? Can’t have it both ways? Just sayin.,"For those who have commented regarding the sanctity of human life... I would like to share some food for thought. I am a ‘95 alumn and science-busines
s double major. I went the business path for 20 years and now am back in graduate school as a medical student. On the same day that I picked up my PPE for my upcoming clinical rotation::: I watched Trump speak at the RNC. In blatant disregard for the Center of a disease Control and Dr. Fauci::: Trump hosted a super-spreader event with 1:::500+ maskless attendees packed close together. This is a slap in the face to the 180:::000 dead::: their families::: all immunocompromis
ed::: all front line workers and all med students heading into rotations. While he should have been leading by example throughout 2020::: he has shown complete disregard for human life. So many people- especially health care workers- feel completely abandoned by him. We all deserve a president who leads by example and who listens to science... doing otherwise has shown he is not a leader who will protect the American people. Thanks for “listening” and considering this. #IStandWithFauci #Biden2020 #wearyourmask #scienceisreal #frontlineworker

There are A LOT of people talking out the side of their mouth about how the college should be demographically
. Notre Dame::: the professors and their students embrace ALL people from all walks of life. As is should be. This is not 1968...it is 2020. I personally know Catholic Democrats who are Pro-choice...sh

I'm sorry::: but supporting abortion is NOT Catholic or Christian for that matter. GOH with that mess. God shall have his day.,It is common knowledge that Fr Jenkins is a liberal anti Trump secular. It is common knowledge that Lou is conservative and pro Trump. Jenkins created this public relations fiasco. Anti Trump Alums will not increase contributions to the University to show support of Jenkins. Conservative Alum may choose to withhold contributions to show support for Holtz.,"FYI.

hting For Fr. Jenkins and all those offended by Holtz's remarks how about you watch one of these abortions and tell us again how Coach Holtz is not living up to that highest calling to love?",Is this the summer of love at Notre Dame. You hire the failed marxists mayor of south bend and you give him speaking time at the DNC and you dont condemn his political views. Cowards leading this once prestigious University.,Pete Osterman,"Follow who you choose but if you support the Democrat ticket you cast support for the killing of children through an entire pregnancy up until birth! Some states have even said they want to support murder of a newly born child-after birth! If you’re truly Christian you know God hates the shedding of innocent blood. ND should too and loudly proclaim such a sin as abominable. That’s loving.

“These six things the Lord hates:::
Yes::: seven are an abomination to Him:
A proud look:::
A lying tongue:::
Hands that shed innocent blood
A heart that devises wicked plans:::
Feet that are swift in running to evil:::
A false witness who speaks lies:::
And one who sows discord among brethren.”

Proverbs 6:16-19",Why you feel you must distance Notre Dame from Lou Holts comments after he spoke HIS opinions at the RNC was disappointing on so many levels. Lou was exercising his right as an American::: talking about HIS opinions and HIS thoughts about a pro abortion Catholic man. And you are distancing Notre Dame from Lou? Lou is not a spokesman for Notre Dame. Until entities stop cowering to the crowd no change is going to happen. It IS what it IS. Biden votes the way he does Lou feels the way he feels. Welcome to America people! It further disappoints that you in your effort to distance yourself from Lou’s comments did not defend the truth in Lou’s statement. In what you didn’t say speaks volumes of what your are defending. People look to you for direction. Lous statement simply said Biden supports some ideals that are not in line with Catholic beliefs and then claims to be Catholic. What in that comment is a lie? After Lou’s comment people have the right to build their own opinions of it and him without your beloved University having to distance yourself from him. Your statement speaks volumes of what you defend..your beloved coach who mentored many for your university? The unborn? No I think it maybe something else more in line with enrollment.,Fr. Jenkins::: you are wrong yet again. Anyone publicly declaring that they are a “practicing Catholic” can not advocate for laws allowing any abortion let alone late term and partial birth abortion::: both of which Mr. Biden endorses and promotes. Your political correctness is extremely disappointing. It was clear that Coach Holtz was speaking for himself and not for or on behalf of the University. Why not use your platform to inform your readers of the Catholic teaching about abortion and then contrast that with Mr. Biden’s views and publicly espoused positions? Inform not only Catholics but the whole world of Catholic doctrine. No::: instead you choose not to alienate the baby killing left wing liberals. Give everyone the church’s teaching and dogma and then let everyone make up their minds for themselves about Mr. Biden. In fact::: your public disclaimer of Coach Holtz’ statement appears more like an endorsement of Mr. Biden than simply a statement of neutrality. Get over your “holier than thou” approach to giving everyone the benefit of the doubt and your ludicrous statement that we can not question the sincerity of one’s faith. When someone publicly declares that his position is in direct contradiction to the faith he professes I believe that it is safe to say that he is not a “practicing” Catholic. He may be a “cultural” Catholic or he may “identify” as a Catholic but it is quite clear and safe to say that Mr. Biden is not now a “practicing” Catholic. You are a complete disappointment to Our Lady’s University and you should be ashamed of yourself. Kevin G. Mescall::: Notre Dame Class of 1979,"Notre Dame - A CINO university. Catholic In Name Only. As a cradle Catholic it is very discouraging how all the Catholic Universities have embraced the liberal agenda contrary to Catholic Sacraments::: dogma and beliefs. Once again you speak out against conservative faithful Catholics and support luke warm Catholics who firmly support abortion. I can hear the echos ringing in your halo'd halls. We have ""no king but Washington DC liberals"". I notice you are quiet and slow to speak out on the McCarrick report. Weak shepherd's with no conviction and backbone cowering to the elites with political pablum. Just full of dead mans bones and all corruption.",I am amazed that Cuomo and Biden call themselves Catholic. As a Catholic I was taught life begins at conception::: yet these two quasi Catholics are pro choice and even up until the last minute. How does that fit in with the Catholic faith and belief? Perhaps ND needs to do some soul searching or explaining. Life is the greatest gift from God and nobody except God has the right to take it away.,Lou Holtz is the GOAT::: I don’t think he is losing any sleep over a BLM apologist school that was too chicksh*t to host the presidential debates😆,Rather than protest the use of the university's name::: speak to Joe Biden's indefensible support of abortion. Dies the university support the fundamental tenets of our religion or believe that Catholics can pick and choose what parts of being a Catholic they want?,"I’m ashamed that Father Jenkins felt that it was important to say his remarks about Coach Holts. I’m ashamed the university didn’t have the respect of the Catholic Church to stand against abortion...that
’s how I felt when you attacked the
situation . Abortion is killing !!!!",Diane Smith Poirier,"It’s hypocritical of ND to issue a statement regarding the L. Holtz speech at RNC while getting Pete Buttigieg to join its faculty. Distancing itself from Holtz while getting cozy with Buttigieg - that’s what this looks like. C’mon ND - be better::: do better! What’s next::: you’ll remove the grotto & deface the basilica? It seems you are only catholic by name & appearance. What would Jesus do? Better yet::: what does HE think of this?

Well Jesus doesn't! So there Notre Dame...not rooting for you anymore.,Adam Machara,"Dear Fr. John Jenkins::: The highest calling to love is to be our brother's Soul Keeper. We Catholics have a big responsibility to tell our brothers and sisters in Christ when they are sinning and living disorderly life as said in the Gospel from the Second Letter of St. Paul to the Thessalonians 3;6-10::: 16-18 ( Wednesday First reading Aug. 26): "" We INSTRUCT YOU::: brothers and sisters::: in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ::: to shun any brother who WALKS AWAY IN A DISORDERLY WAY AND NOT ACCORDING TO THE TRADITION THEY RECEIVED FROM US.""So we must tell BIDEN and PELOSI that ABORTION is INTENTIONAL KILLING of the Unborn Babies. It is MURDER. And if we vote to these Candidates who are supporting ABORTION UNTIL FULL-TERM. Then we will bring more souls to DAMNATION. Peace and Hope you will see the truth that this is a very important duty of any Catholics. God bless::: Gemma Tiu",Ruth Eick-Wilcox,Harold Gonzalez,So to be clear: Notre Dame condemns Lou Holtz‘s implication that abortion is contradictory to the Catholic faith.

No wonder we Catholics are fleeing a sinking moral ship!,I was a big Lou Holtz fan until now. Anybody that thinks Trump is a winner is out in my book. Trump is a racist scumbag ruining this country,"You wouldn't have said shite::: had Holtz endorsed pro-abortion Biden and Killer Kamala.
Sad that ND doesn't have the cajones to stand up for the unborn::: consistent with the Church's teachings. Are you worried about being unpopular with the idiot twenty-somethin
gs and mainstream media?
Are ye still Catholic?",Very sad to hear what Lou Holtz had to say::: trump is not a Christian and never has been and to challenge Biden who is a life long Catholic was wrong on his part. Im no longer a fan of Holtz's,Why would YOU Norte Dame condemn Lou Holtz? Is Biden lining your pockets? Biden is ok with Norte Dame allowing students/women getting 9 month abortions. SICKENING.,You endorse BLM and thats the Democrats period. UND your disgusting anymore.,Jenkins once again proves that he is a PINO- Priest in Name Only.,We get it::: Jenkins.

Why don't you do what Jesus intended for you to do....Jesus called out the religious elite and those who offended God as vipers and dogs. The fact that you're putting more emphasis on a former coach's position than standing up to a political party hell-bent on destroying human life and punishing religious orders for not offering abortion and birth control insurance speaks volumes.

Funny::: I didn't see any of Holtz's other colleges he coached besides Notre Dame::: like NC State::: Arkanas::: Minnesota or South Carolina put out a statement like ND did.

Maybe you should be more worried about your liberal professors teaching and indoctrinating the students of Notre Dame with evil and despicible ideologies of liberal socialism::: but I guess you're complicit with that teaching because the Pope is a socialist.

Go Irish!,"Good morning from NY::: thank you for the updates::: but as a ND mother first and a NYC COVID ICU 2nd::: I truly believe that the first misstep of this outbreak came in the initial type of test used.
There is a higher probability of not appropriately collecting enough of a true sample with a nasal swab and it may be the underlying problem. COVID harbors deep in the nasopharyngeal cavity 😪

It is a known fact that this age group is commonly known as our asymptomatic carriers and the return to campus test should have been a nasopharyngeal not nasal.
I think that's why within 4 days of these 2 parties the spread came from undetected asymptomatic carriers.

More importantly::: the entire student body needs to be retested::: because revealing the asymptomatic carriers is imperative.

And finally and more concerning... I reached out to health services on Wednesday inquiring if the unfortunate decision is made to send the students home will they all depart the campus with a test result prior to getting in a car::: train or plane? The response...."" honestly I don't have an answer to your question.""
That simple question needs to be addressed sooner rather than later.

However::: as with most other communications from ND::: I didn't hear any mention of what is being done to address the mental and emotional wellness of the students. That's a glaring oversight when you are significantly limiting the physical and social activities of these young people. Let's make sure this desire to keep the students on campus does not result in significant psychological harm due to the significant restrictions.
What are you doing to ensure the mental and emotional health of the students?",College should be only for those who desire education to achieve important careers that require knowledge. It's not a play school to help the immature adapt to adulthood!,"Thank you Father Pete. I have a freshman who is committed to following the protocols and making everyone safe.

I can't quit thinking about how ND is still charging the same amount of money to study online as a live classroom.,Many kids are doing the right thing and are mature enough to handle these restrictions::: and are willing to follow the rules to stay on campus. There's a % that don't take it seriously (parents::: too) and the University needs to get on it and send them home once rules are broken::: like Purdue. Allowing these kids to break rules when it affects the health and lives of so many isn't doing them any favors. They need to grow up and go into the unsheltered world understanding consequences and giving a care about other people besides themselves. That doesn't mean we can't show them grace but it also doesn't mean they can just do what they want. Believe it or not::: you can get through college without beer parties. ND may be different right now::: but it's still a special place to be. Time to understand the new restrictive college campus experience::: or they go home.

"University of Notre Dame President Fr. John Jenkins announced today that in-person classes are suspended::: effective Wednesday::: replaced by remote instruction only for the next two weeks because positive rates for the coronavirus continue to climb.

“With the advice and encouragement of Dr. Mark Fox of the St. Joseph County Health Department::: we believe we can take steps short of sending students home for remote instruction::: at least for the time being::: while still protecting the health and safety of the campus community:::"" Fr. Jenkins told students in a virtual meeting this afternoon.

Notre Dame enacts two weeks of remote instruction",8/18/2020 21:11,Is ANYone surprised at any of the colleges that this is happening?,"I think that the infected “off campus” students should be quarantined / isolated in on campus dorms where they can be monitored and don’t CONTINUE to shed virus in the house & community.
Also- I think that the rest of students should be sent home to study online. I fear that online classes for off campus students means one thing— day drinking.
If I lived in South Bend::: I would not be happy with ND!",Possibly lockdown the campus. The residential students can’t leave campus (other than for jobs or essential reasons). It is better than having to all go home. Off campus students can only come for classes and the library.,You make the best decision you can with the information you are provided. Don't let the Monday morning quarterbacks get you down.,I::: for one::: am incredibly proud of the action taken to date. ND is trying to bring some normalcy to our kid’s lives. In the long run::: it may not work but at least they are trying. Unlike many of the other universities who threw in the towel weeks ago. God’s speed ND!!! We are praying for your success. 🙏🙏,Janelle Towne seems like a Bot posting the same propaganda over and over again.,All schools and Universities should to go to 50% capacity. The greed of money is evil,Don’t party continue the social distancing wear masks stop the spread of Covid 19,I hear students cannot leave their dorms for 14 days AND NO AC!,"As with other communications from ND::: I didn't see any mention of what is being done to address the mental and emotional wellness of the students. That's a glaring oversight when you are significantly limiting the physical and social activities of these young people. Let's make sure this desire to keep the students on campus does not result in significant psychological harm due to the significant restrictions.
ND - What are you doing to ensure the mental and emotional health of the students?",Please don’t give up on the plan::: Father John. After tightening up give it time to let things quiet down. Don’t let this be a lost year!,God bless all the strong opinions on this board::: especially Dawn Glodowski Smith who may be on the the opposite end of my spectrum. Kudos! Love it! Thank u! But who the hell is this microchip person!? ;-),How about Notre Dame add to the code of discipline that violating social distancing and university regulations will result in a students immediate suspension and protect those students that are following the guidelines.,"Maybe all students::: faculty::: and staff should be tested again. You only tested students before return::: not faculty and staff. Harvard Global Health scholars say only frequent quick testing of the entire campus community will stop spread from getting out of control.
And how will off-campus students be monitored that they are abiding by these guidelines?
I seem to recall several emails from administration that encouraged more students to live off campus::: to de-densify the dorms.",You could have a 50% case rate and the kids are still impervious. This is not the plague. Are you saying the kids aren’t going to costco? Aren’t hanging out with other people when not in class? Are they all in quarantine if they aren’t in their accounting or engineering class? When are people in leadership positions going to exercise some common sense? Shutting down classes does NOTHING.,Two weeks? Try three or four to make sure it goes through a full cycle rather than waiting for it to incubate.,uggggg; sorry this is happening. Prayed. ND would be the light for others to follow,After 2 weeks they will be fine. UND don't want to send students home.,First::: is there a drinking culture being ignored at ND as there were many off campus parties I was informed of last year? Maybe drinking needs to be addressed. These students from a certain program that are having these large parties need to be sent home. It’s unfair to most of the students that are following the rules to have to pay the price of the few. I understand the thought of no punishment so students fess up for contact tracing::: but apparently after the first party these partiers are not taking COVID-19 serious. As they are caught::: send them home for the rest of the year::: maybe then they will get the message.,"If anyone had doubts about how easily COVID19 spreads this reinforced it. May God keep them all safe.
#CommonsenseOver

Don’t the students understand that if the Univ. can’t get this under control now or if it happens again they will all be sent home for video learning? And then no football or any other sports? Come on ND! Get with the program! Kevin G. Mescall ND ‘79,"Alum from family of alums. This is extremely sad for students seriously

danger to local residents and businesses. NDU certainly supports the South Bend economy but it is an immediate danger now. As said in so many comments::: this high virus transmission rate at NDU was easy to predict. Unfortunately::: continuing off-campus ND student presence is unlikely to fare well either in regard to COVID.",Anyone with 2 brain cells to rub together knew this was going to be the outcome . . .,They can’t open schools her teachers are refusing to go back. They have not met the benchmarks to begin with..,What was the rush to open in the first place?,Beyond disappointed in the actions of these students who willfully defied the rules and health protocols that I’m sure they agreed to abide by when they enrolled. To have willfully and recklessly put their fellow students::: faculty and staff at risk is unacceptable! You are ND... you can do better than this!,"So many forecast this would happen but got slammed for daring to question mighty ND.

Glad Father Jenkins saw the right way to proceed.

The University of North Carolina is going through the same cycle of infection...",Praying for ND. If anyone can be successful at on campus learning it is the Fighting Irish.,Why are they waiting on a vaccine? Give the healthy and Covid 19 students Zinc::: Vitamin D3 and Vitamin C. If they have it it will be gone in a week. Why are they censoring what doctors can say to their patients. They want everyone to wait on a vaccine that someone will be making billions on. Let's help them now! ❤,"Could this be an unspoken transition period to sending everyone home? Isolate everyone to the best of their ability for two weeks to avoid sending potentially infected students back to families and communities. Also::: they must have a 'Stop Rule""::: meaning once we reach X cases::: the school shuts down completely. Have we reached it::: and this is the result::: or do we have more to go?",Who is the yahoo throwing a keg party in a pandemic? Peer pressure on a ruined school year better kick in soon.,No kidding?!? Could not have seen this coming!!!!!!,"I’m an alum from the class of 2000. I could have told you 5 months ago that hundreds of 18-22 year olds wouldn’t socially distance. I mean hello::: don’t you remember how you felt when you were that age and away from your parents?

That being said::: I hope the university can keep everyone as safe as possible",What are they going to do about the football games??,It's a wrap. The best time to shut it down would've been before everyone came back. The second best time is now. We'll try again next year.,"I think the students who went to the parties are in very deep trouble. Very thankful it wasn’t mine. And I don’t say that like my student can do no wrong. Any student could be careless including mine. Sad for the parents of the kids who made bad choices. God can use poor choices for teachable moments and for His glory.

I will be praying for our university.🙏",Is ND holding students accountable for their behavior if they are not observing the rules of social distancing? And monitoring off campus and on campus gatherings?,I love the school::: but the off campus living can be crazy. It’s too bad they aren’t that mature yet. Sorry I saw this coming. Can’t control outside the campus. 😢,It's disappointing and concerning but we are very grateful to ND' s quick and vigilant actions. 🙏🙏,"New nickname: ""The Frightened Irish""",Love thee!!!

Second::: as the recent examples of Peru::: New Zealand::: Australia::: Japan and much of Europe reveal::: it is IMPOSSIBLE TO ""DEFEAT"" THE VIRUS THROUGH LOCKDOWNS.

It’s a must read. There is fear and ignorance surrounding Covid and it’s destroying lives and relationships. There are a lot of myths in the media and on this thread being perpetuated about Covid and a lot of facts surrounding Covid to learn. If you truly wish to encourage Notre Dame (or others) for the better please order and read this compilation written by a UNC Chapel Hill Epidemiologist citing over 300 references and scientific studies.

"""After consultation with Dr. Mark Fox::: St. Joseph County Deputy Health Officer::: and with the unanimous support of the Executive Committee of our Board of Trustees::: I have made this difficult decision because the necessary health precautions would have greatly diminished the educational value of hosting the debate on our campus.""

This event would have been great for the community!,sad that ND has gone so liberal that they're afraid to make china-joe look bad::: they could easily make this work if it would have benefitted them politically,The real reason it was cancelled is they saw all the lunatics burning down buildings and decided they didn’t want that over there.,So much for having faith in God that he would take care of people,He was afraid that they would be showcasing an antiabortion candidate plus they would have to show Biden also!,It’s sad to see people trolling a Notre Dame post to make ridiculous political statements. Please find peace and meaning in your lives::: folks.,Prudent decision::: keep everyone as safe as possible,I would have thought your institution had enough brains to figure out a safe way to hold this debate. Hidin’ Biden.,ND didn’t want their campus destroyed,It’s O.K. for the students to attend school::: but not to attend a debate? I can’t believe Notre Dame would have made the same spineless decision under Father Theodore Hesburgh::: a true leader.,How much did they pay you to cancel?,Those who Our Lady's University educated appreciate the thoughtfulness of this decision. Thank you for your consistent integrity. Go Irish!,I guess no football until at least October,Thank you::: ND! The last thing our students need on top of dealing with a pandemic is the circus this would bring. Thank you for looking out for their health and safety! ☘️,They mean to say after consultation with the DNC and Bidens handlers they have decided to bail slow Joe out.,Jumping for joy! This was the unversity's only way to get the current resident of the white house on campus since he will NEVER::: EVER merit an honor from the school.,The reasoning behind this decision makes zero sense to me.,very sad that @notredame can not expect attendees and the campus community to respect political dialogue and act like decent americans. I think @notredame is failing to show leadership in this case,"As a Catholic::: I keep hoping Notre Dame will be bold & be a leader. Instead over the years I keep seeing a more secular institution groveling to pop culture.

I::: like many other Americans::: were excited at the opportunity to actually hear our two candidates together; not their handlers::: not their commercials::: & not their carefully crafted appearances::: but the candidates together. You had the opportunity to do that for the whole country. Instead::: you mouse a weak excuse. At what point are you going to admit that truth::: integrity::: & even Catholicism mean little to you any more?

What a shame.",Thank you for making this decision in favor of the health::: safety and well-being of your students::: campus community and South Bend.,Safety first!!!,Good decision::: but if football still goes on::: I’ll be very confused,That is a complete lie . Notre Dame is in the Democrats pocket . How much money did they bribe you with to drop the debate ? Democrats are denying people the right to freely worship but the corrupt leadership of the Univeristy supports them anyway . Left wing Marxists hate Christians . You think the church would have learned that by now but money is more important to them,That is a shame! I do not know why ND could not have hosted & just had no audience - like a baseball game. A Presidential debate is a huge honor.,I have to agree this was a good decision,Glad ND is not hosting the event. We do not need the campus to be Portland after all.,they're playing basketball::: baseball and may start football but you can't host a debate with a live television audience only ... come on ND enough playing the political games,I guess no football for the health and safety of everyone in the county.,"Wonderful ! I shuddered at the thought of that scoundrel Trump on Our Lady’s campus !
Jack ND ‘62","It has nothing to do with the ""plandemic"".",Good plan. As parent of an ND student::: this cautious approach is applauded.,It is the safety of our Young adults first!! Thank you!! Even though it would be great HISTORY!!!😉. Something the world doesn’t like!!,The debate has simply been switched to another venue... Cleveland. It is still going to happen.,If you wanted to really host it - you would. Perhaps not with a large crowd::: but it could be done. Disappointing.,A debate needs at least two people. Wasn't going to happen anyway.,Biden is breathing a huge sigh of relief!,So sad but so necessary to cancel.,I think Father Jenkins didn’t want Biden to look bad because he can’t stand Trump.,"As an NYC COVID ICU nurse::: I am happy to hear that you have reached this decision...the students returning to school and being in closed quarters is enough of a concern.
Taking this event out of the equation just enhances the goal of attaining a healthier campus. 🙏 Be well::: stay safe.",GO IRISH !!! Thank you ND for putting the Notre Dame family first!,Right decision but so sad that ND has to make it.,Biden wasn't showing up anyway::: if Paul Krugman's words are any indication.,"Pitiful the odds are pretty good ND is
Not what it was
This is sad cover for
Hiden Biden","Thank you Notre Dame!
Joe",as a student::: I couldn't be happier about this decision. Thank you ND for putting the community first.,This is a good decision. I think it’s probably a moot point as Trump has said several times he’ll probably “skip” them.,Neither candidate wants one anyway,Great idea! It would have been nice to host this but great choice!,Why not just host without an audience or a spin room? That would lead to a better debate anyway.,Thank you for putting the students::: faculty and staff first!,Go Irish. Seems like you are losing your fight.,Not surprised at all,Lol what a joke::: NotreDame.

God is first.,"This is great ND. Thank you! A bunch of fairweathered nay sayers in the house. Someone asked::: can Catholics support 'Black Live Matter'. YES they can! As a matter of fact::: I actually attend mass regularly (or watch it::: these days) and Im not just talking about on just religious holidays either. Not one of those! I dont know how the topic went from tolerance and acceptance to ABORTION::: but ok. Let's go there. I find that most 'Christians' who oppose abortion are not even practicing Christians. Because if they were::: they wouldnt have so much hate in their hearts. Personally::: I am pro-life but I believe it should be a personal choice. I believe it is between YOU AND GOD. Free will people. Why not provide accessable birth control for all? That will reduce the # of abortions. If you are Pro-life I bet that you are probably against social programs like food stamps/
welfare. You dont want them to get abortions but yet you also dont want them to give them the tools to raise their kids. In a perfect world everyone would finish school::: get married and have children::: in that order. But we dont live in perfect world do we. If you are pro -life you SHOULD also be FOR GUN REFORM. If not::: I guess you just want to save their inevitable faith for later because chances are they will probably get killed in elementary or high school from gun voilence. And who again is committing these mass shootings and school shootings? White young males who were either gifted the firearms or able to purchased them for themselves. Likewise::: you should be PRO-MASK because NOT wearing one KILLS! It makes sense people.",University of Notre Dame It’s refreshing to see these initiatives being raised at the top but concerning Father Jenkins & other members of the clergy are not more vocal. Either way I will support the great efforts Of the people at the University who care and want Notre Dame to be a beacon of light for this nation. The comments in the thread show it what is obviously free course to alumni and fans on history of the racist housing voting and hiring practices of this country That have left white & Black Americans who have been in this country for the same amount of time with Black people arguing fighting harder to survive at such different levels of wealth and access.,Good grief.

Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition

The Peril of Falling Away

6 Therefore let us leave the elementary doctrines of Christ and go on to maturity::: not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward God::: with instruction about ablutions::: the laying on of hands::: the resurrection of the dead::: and eternal judgment. 3 And this we will do if God permits. 4 For it is impossible to restore again to repentance those who have once been enlightened::: who have tasted the heavenly gift::: and have become partakers of the Holy Spirit::: 5 and have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the age to come::: 6 if they then commit apostasy::: since they crucify the Son of God on their own account and hold him up to contempt. 7 For land which has drunk the rain that often falls upon it::: and brings forth vegetation useful to those for whose sake it is cultivated::: receives a blessing from God. 8 But if it bears thorns and thistles::: it is worthless and near to being cursed; its end is to be burned.

9 Though we speak thus::: yet in your case::: beloved::: we feel sure of better things that belong to salvation. 10 For God is not so unjust as to overlook your work and the love which you showed for his sake in serving the saints::: as you still do. 11 And we desire each one of you to show the same earnestness in realizing the full assurance of hope until the end::: 12 so that you may not be sluggish::: but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.",Very nice!🍀❣️,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My daughter (JR Enginerring) has worked as a CNA nurse since March::: tested for CoVid 6 times and is still negative after multiple exposures. What i can say with 100% certainty is that spring semester online was a joke regarding trying to learn Engineering! Glad ND is trying to make it work. We just need our kids to follow the rules and wear a mask. If football players can do it::: the kids can!! Go Irish,Is the faculty and staff being required as well? Because it makes no sense to have students tested if faculty and staff are not required.,"In Asia right now where the curve has flattened::: and what I'm more interested in seeing is what policy ND has regarding contact tracing::: testing and isolation. In some ways::: the ND campus is like a country::: except that there are no border controls::: so it'll be harder to prevent community spread if anyone who's infected (and asymptomatic) starts spreading it to everyone else. To demand testing before going back to campus is a good first step::: but what are the guidelines regarding life on campus? Must masks be worn at all times::: and social distancing maintained too? What about visits to bars::: restaurants and public places in SB? and how is campus security going to enforce these rules? and let's assume something happens::: there's community spread (VERY easy to see that happening when there are people going to and fro)::: how is ND going to isolate these cases and most of all::: what about contact tracing? Is every student::: staff and faculty required to download an app and scan their mobile upon entry to every building on campus? I'm not too worried about football games since the entire season might be cancelled (the Wisconsin game's cancelled already)::: or games might be played without fans (like in Europe now)::: but if full-fledged games are permitted::: then expect community spread::: everyone who's allowed this has received bad returns worldwide. If there is community spread::: then contact tracing is vital in keeping the numbers down and everyone who's infected treated promptly and those who are not protected. Then there's the question of testing::: does ND/
SB have enough facilities and staff to ensure prompt and massive testing? and what about medical care? Do they have enough ventilators and ICUs available? and isolation stations too::: how many beds are there available? If there's a spread::: there has gotta be well-established and effective protocols available to handle it::: and then there must be curfews and all in place once a case is detected::: and once again::: how much ""discipline"" can admin and campus security enforce? I can't see them manhandling and rounding up anyone without a mask or keeping their dorm room doors opened::: and is mass dining in SDH and NDH allowed then? No way they're gonna be able to pull a Wuhan-styled enforcement model on campus::: but if you're lax::: then you get more cases and medical facilities get strained. I'd say its best to exercise caution given that the curve stateside hasn't flattened::: but I'm also confident the admin will take all steps necessary to protect the students::: staff and faculty on campus. This Rona bug is rather troublesome::: if you relax too much it'll come back with a vengeance::: and politics and ideology aside::: the life and safety of everyone on campus is paramount. I'd say let's hope for the best but be prepared for the worst::: so there's gotta be a solid plan in place before everyone returns.
All the best to all the returning students::: Go Irish!",ND leading the way! Go Irish! Praying for a swift end to the pandemic but that’s unlikely so we need to be smart like ND and stick with science and our school ☘️,Being fantastically risk averse is now a badge of honor. Other countries and the WHO observe three feet of social distancing::: while our noblesse oblige politicians invoke six feet guaranteeing an unworkable return to economic life::: which incidentally is how life is sustained on our planet. Our hysteria stems from the accumulation of yet another set of arbitrary guidelines not targeted at interventions for highly vulnerable populations but set to control your impulse to resume individual initiative in protecting human life and livelihoods.,I am so glad students are returning. These are for the most part healthy kids. I know my student is excited about moving into her dorm soon::: starting her sophomore year. Hopefully there will be football & marching band::: a great tradition. Go Irish.,Thank you for all of your hard work! We are so grateful for your efforts::: time::: and countless hours of work to make this happen!,Good policy👏,"I look at the hospitalization
rate vs. cases as 99% recover from the virus.

Covidtracker.co
m",What about the graduate student housing being used as a quarantine ward? Where will they go?,like this will work... what is the plan for students coming and going throughout the semester? What is the protocol for professors? What about people who live in a household with essential workers? What about students who work second jobs? I've NEVER been more disappointed in the Tri-Campus Community. I'm ashamed that monetary gains are being prioritized over student lives. As someone currently in the University of California system::: I'm aware there are other remote options. Remote teaching (which I'm also doing right now) is not ideal::: but it is necessary in the moment. The Tri-Campus community should be focusing on resources to make remote learning better::: NOT forcing students to become exposed to a deadly virus. It's appalling for students::: staff::: and faculty.,A great deal of the graduate students have been on campus well over a month now. Why weren’t we tested then?,asked? what if they refuse?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

How disappointing to see that the President of the University would go to an event in the Rose Garden and not wear a mask despite the tight seating. He should quarantine before being allowed back on campus!,Abet Frias,God bless Notre Dame!🍀❣️,Go Fighting Irish! Always and forever in our hearts!!!,"https://

It lives in all seasons of earth latitude and longitude; a new living creature and a new parable from the species of tiniest-creatur
es. O children of Adam::: in fact it is blood tiniest-creatur
e from its minutest size::: that is chastisement of evil-plague in the Book by which Allah subjected pharaoh and his soldiers::: tiny in its size yet great in its annihilation::: in fact it is most damaging than the flood::: locust::: bugs and frogs; in fact it is blood disease directly inflicts children of Adam from the minor chastisement to those who turn away from the Book::: and we do not show them a sign but it is bigger than its sister::: and it is similar signs differ in annihilation and infliction by which Allah aided every prophet::: so He inflicted their folks from the minor chastisement. Allah’s prophets said to them an evil-plague has fallen upon you from your Lord and it is from the minor chastisement before the major chastisement for you may return so you call on Allah::: Him Alone::: begging and humble from the humiliation then they promised their Lord to follow caller of the Truth from their Lord to remove away from them what inflicted them of harm::: so Allah responded to them and removed what they have of harm then He commanded His soldiers that occupy against them in their land to leave their land and Allah healed them::: but unfortunately::: after they been healed of what inflicted them they said: It is mere pandemic has inflicted our forefathers before and they were healed from it before us. And Allah the Most High said: {And We did not send a prophet to a town but We seized its people with distress and affliction that they might plead (humbling themselves).(94
) Then We changed the evil for good::: till they became affluent and said: Distress and happiness did indeed touch our fathers. So We took them by surprise while they perceived not.(95)}Truthf

In fact::: it is from levels of the minor chastisement::: for each are levels of what they did but most people do not know::: would Allah inflict them with this but as warning to them so Allah would not annihilate them by the major chastisement altogether while they are ungrateful-disb
elievers? But unfortunately::: after they pleaded to their Lord humbly crying (Allah) had mercy for them and removed what befell them::: then lo! They broke their covenant and their hearts hardened after the pleading and humbling! And Allah the Most High said: {And indeed We sent (messengers) to nations before you then We seized them with distress and affliction that they might humble themselves.(42)
Yet why did they not::: when Our punishment came to them::: humble themselves? But their hearts hardened and satan made all that they did seem fair to them.(43) Then::: when they neglected that with which they had been admonished::: We opened for them the gates of all things. Until::: when they rejoiced in that which they were given::: We seized them suddenly; then lo! they were in utter despair.(44)}Tr

O decision makers::: leaders of the humans and their people altogether in various regions::: I exhort you only to one thing that you rise-up forGod’s sake by twos and singly::: then ponder who is the one that God fulfilled to him the challenge with Truth upon the actual reality in regard to what they call it coronavirus? Is it the challenge of the human physicians or the challenge of the Awaited Mahdi servant of God and His khalifa the Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammad Al-Yemeni?

That’s in order for you to know the sure knowledge that by no means and they can never encompass knowledge from Allah except by what He pleases; glory be to Him above what you associate (with Him) and apostate because of what you have from modern science have deceived and (Allah) encompassed you with what the ancient ones did not have::: then what you have from science of the technical data and the knowledge in various fields have deceived you::: for that (Allah) challenged you by what you do not encompass knowledge and from the tiniest soldiers of Allah until He made your data zero on the left (has no value) O community of whom they rejoiced with what they have of knowledge and they thought that they indeed have power over everything then Allah insulted your ability and humiliated your arrogance and removed your conceitedness by the smallest soldier from His creation; not seen by the naked eye for its small size and that’s in order for you to know the worth of yourselves::: as well in order for you to know the sure knowledge that Allah’s chastisement; the strangling disease of what you call it coronavirus that could never remove it from you other than Allah::: Him Alone. Verily::: they must repent from the major sins::: indecencies::: oppressing people and the wrongfulness of association::: and to say: “Our Lord::: we have wronged ourselves::: if You do not forgive us and (not) have mercy on us we certainly would be of the losers”. And after the repent let them say: “Oh Allah::: I am Your servant::: I ask you by the fact there is no God except You::: and by the fact of Your mercy that You ordained upon YourSelf::: and by the fact of greatness of the Bliss of YourSelf’s good-pleasure that is greater than the bliss of Your heavenly-garden
that you heal me from the chastisement of corona or remove it away from me surely I believe in the true caller from You. Oh Allah::: remove Your chastisement away from us and from every entrance so we would follow the path of Truth from You::: and to make us steadfast on fulfilling what we promised You — O Who comes between man and his heart::: surely we do not have except Your mercy that You ordained upon YourSelf. Indeed::: if You do not forgive us and (not) have mercy on us we would surely be of the losers. Oh our Allah::: You have said in Your decisive Book: {And your Lord says: Pray to Me::: I will answer you.}Truthful Allah the Great [Ghãfer] 40:60::: so from me is the supplication and turning (close) yet from You is to responding::: indeed you You never violate Your promise::: our Lord::: glory be to You::: Surely Your promise is ever True and You are the Most Merciful than all who have mercy. O our Allah::: make us steadfast upon fulfilling what we promised You to follow Allah’s global caller khalifa of Allah in the land; the Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammad Al-Yemeni. O our Allah::: make sending him as favor on us and not affliction against us because we turned away from his true call (to Allah); for the Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammad Al-Yemeni”.

..Coronavirus and the decisive explanatory-sta
tement::: and it is not a joke👇👆","08 🌷 07 🌷2020
Quote From the Imam Mahdi's statement
🇺🇸👇🇺🇸🌷🇺🇸👇🇺🇸
Our fatwa has preceded with Truth that what they call it coronavirus has a source that is not unknown in the decisive grand Quran; (some tiniest-creatur
e) yet they do not encompass knowledge about it::: and the word (some) is built for the upcoming unknown::: and here it is the time of fulfilling the setting of parable has come; the promised challenge from Allah in the Book. As that the new sorts of viruses against the humans which has lengthy lifespan; amphibious::: air-floater::: winter(y)::: summer(y)::: it is equipped with its source; a miracle from Allah to live in all (seasonal) climates in order to be a worldwide chastisement::: and it is not as the epidemic verses that the humans know; in fact::: it has lengthy lifespan; it lives in the human’s body cunning (being contagious) from (one) human being to (another) human being exclusively::: then it lives in the open air after its exiting from the body so it would live as well without a body till when Allah pleases in order to afflict others::: being driven by the command of its Lord afflicting therewith whom He pleases and turning it away from whom He pleases. and the source has a big role it carries out its role with exceeding speed::: and it is some tiny creature yet your eyes do not see it. An addition in the creation and challenge from Allah::: a new creation (some tiniest-creatur
e) as if it is a war plain; in fact it is faster than your war plains and your land::: air and space missiles by a great difference it travels by Allah’s words glory be to Him::: and its mission is entering into the chest of a human being to scatter its eggs into the chests a scattering with exceeding speed laying its eggs inside the chest of a human being::: in order for its virus offspring to be transmitted from humans to humans after the eggs are hatched then it multiply and divide inside the body of a human being as the spread of fire in dry straw so it would transmit from a human being to another human being. And by now means and never infect an animal nor birds no matter what they lie to you surely they will not and would never bring the clear scientific proof::: also will not and would never afflict the seen mosquito at all::: in fact its hidden source is (Alba-oodah) the hidden tiny creature and it is the set parable in the creation by be and it is also it does not have a male that Allah created it from it nor has a female mother has laid it; in fact::: a tiny creature (ba-ooda) of challenge::: a new parable among the nations of tiny creatures. And it is (ba-oodah) tiny creature that Allah created with words of His power “Be” and it is. And it is not of the stingers nor the carriers of your disease from species of the known mosquito that you have::: holly Allah. In fact it is of the piercing penetrating (creature) that has an extraordinary exceeding speed that takes one of the humans who it invades him into his chest so it would take it as incubator for its eggs then it scatters its eggs with extraordinary speed scattering::: then it departs the body::: set off with extremely high speed leaving its eggs inside the chest of the human being::: so it would hatch through its nursery then viruses sprout from it and multiply in the body of a human being into (many) viruses::: and (center) its activity is in the chest. As for the factory of eggs for the lord obeying (ba-oodah) minute creature it leaves the body directly::: and only it makes the human being as a nursery for its eggs until it hatches then spread in the body (like) spreading of fire in the dry straw::: also center of multiplication of it is in the chest so it would infect by the tiny-seeds of its eggs from which it emerges::: as that the way of infections to other people from a human being to another human being::: through the open air; an air swimmers; so it would remain as living creatures in the air::: and it is not a mere world pandemic passing through::: willing he who pleased and rejects he who refused::: because the passing through pandemic is a cloud and it diminishes. Fare from::: very far::: I did not declare it to the humans as a mere world pandemic passing through; in fact I announced it (being) a world chastisement continuing night and day by Allah’s command::: the One::: the Subduer::: in various countries of the worlds with fluctuating levels from one person to another. For each are levels according to what they did::: some of it a warning and some of it an evil spread far and wide; in fact the new mother minute creature (Ba-oodah) is a worldwide calamity from the minor chastisement for you may humble yourselves to your Lord and beseech to Him repenting turning near to Him to have mercy for you so He would remove away from His chastisement::: so you would follow His Book the grand Quran. Then you obey Allah’s khalifa over the worlds::: His servant Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammad Al-Yemeni.

So do not be haughty above Allah’s khalifa then He would curse you a grievous curse as He cursed satan who got haughty above prostration to Adam; the human being — first khalifa of Allah — of mankind. So do not think the Imam Mahdi is dumb::: in fact smart and I am aware of I say::: I still insist that what you call it coronavirus is a living creature breaks-down and splits in the bodies of humans. There is no virus of its kind in the bodies of pigs::: donkeys::: cows::: camels nor in the entire cattle::: and the entire animals and birds are being disassociated from this world chastisement that continues night and day in various climates among the worlds.

I call Allah to witness and indeed Allah is a sufficient Witness that it is not as the causing illness viruses of which the human physicians know it — who are specialized in science of viruses that can not live except in bodies::: in fact itself and its source the hidden (Ba-oodah) tiny creature you can not annihilate it with the entire insect eradicators; in fact it will remain alive whether in your bodies or in the air::: sea::: or land::: as well it lives in various climates regardless you are pleased or deny::: yet it is not forever; in fact::: it is continuing until you submit to Allah’s khalifa so you would follow Allah’s Book the grand Quran and disbelieve in what is contrary to Allah’s decisive Book the grand Quran::: I am a trustworthy advisor to you before (Allah) effaces faces then turns them on their backs or curse them as He cursed the Sabbath breakers a grievous cures when He pleases if did benefit you the chastisement admonition of (ba-oodah) the tiny creature that is originated from its minute-eggs::: thus it breaks-down and splits — a chastisement to what is in the chests::: verily each is broken-down and split for you may believe::: and I give you an example about this: One grain out of which grow seven ears::: in every ear a hundred grains::: so look at this grain that you eat; it broke-down and split into hundreds of grains from one original grain::: this example only for you to know the intended of dividing and splitting and I do not say to you words of play and prose::: so keep your duty to Allah the One::: the Subduer.

As a parent of a ND/St Mary’s I’ve visited the campus many times. On our tour We walked down the center of Notre Dame University and I saw the original men’s dorms all with Irish names. The American Irish are proud of this mascot. My uncle Gene Walsh who fought in WW2 to keep the world free from Evil. The Irish are brave and willing to fight for the Freedoms we all enjoy!! My Uncle Gene Walsh wore an ND hat with pride!! This is a write up of my Irish Great Grandfather Madden.,Jenkins is on the wrong side of almost every issue. He needs to go!,Thank you for advocating for these students.,"Is it true you are a catholic institution?

There are a plethora of reasons and justifications international students already admitted for in-person courses should be allowed to retain their visas for online education. Namely that they will not be ensured the same quality of education or access in their home countries::: nor are they getting the same access to the job market that they would have had when they entered into the contract with the University for their education. I agree they need to provide valid justification to attend::: be on campus::: get a visa::: etc::: but some come from war-torn countries; some have no access to the internet or quality to stream live courses; some come from countries that do not value or allow higher education for women; some do not have private spaces to work::: ""sit in"" on a class::: or study; some do not have resources for food and shelter without financial aid and would have to work full time; and simply that many international time differences are unmanageable and unrealistic from both the student's perspective and the University's course management. I don't know if they should rubber stamp educational visas::: but they absolutely should not rubber stamp a denial; that's ridiculous. Many of these reasons are why these Universities are also keeping some student housing options open and available for American students that don't have the same resources at ""home"" that they would have on-campus.",Go Irish!,"I would like to add my voice to the thousands of Irish-Americans
who find your “Fighting Irish” mascot totally offensive. I would like to invite Notre Dame to join the 21st::: by removing this mascot from your university.",My daughter’s roommate is from Spain. She just shared ND is advising her to stay and study and in Toledo::: Spain. She wants to come to main campus but hasn’t received approval yet. So sad for the international students...all the students but bit more red tape for them at the moment.,Go ND!,"This letter is kinda nutty. What's the point? More virtue signaling?

Student visas are issued to foreign nationals to allow them to take classes::: in person::: in the US. If ALL of a student's classes are online::: there's no need for them to come here. They can take their online classes from their home country...so no need to come to the US and no need for a visa.

This is not a new rule. The DHS announcement is just a reminder of a rule that has existed and has been consistently enforced for decades.",Time for you to go,Bravo Notre Dame! Thank you Father Jenkins!💛🍀,Thank you Fr Jenkins::: ND and the whole community for standing up for us 🙏🏻 Our kids have worked hard to join this University.,Any chance of offering small or individual in person classes for those students who would need in person classes in case the rule stands?,Juan Vitulli,Thank you for standing up for the international students.,Thank you ND! Whose shameful idea was this to send students home ?,Way to go Father John.,If they are not attending classes in person::: what justification do they have for being here?,👏 👏 👏,Thank you Fr. Jenkins. Please::: continue to use your voice with other leaders in higher education. You have had and today still have my full respect and support! Thank you.,Doing the wrong thing is dishonest to the United States!,Man a lot of people who didn’t go to ND criticizing the decisions of the school.,Surprised at ND for some of their issues... very surprised because of what our Catholic Faith believes in 🙏❤️🙏,Absolutely! Someone like Donald Trump::: who may also be available for the job in a few months. God help us all.,I’m wondering if the university will join MIT & Harvard in taking legal action. A letter is a great first step but I hope we do more for our students.,"Absolutely and whole heartedly agree. Thank you Notre Dame for doing the right thing::: I would have expected nothing less.
I for one::: cannot fathom how our country::: one big beautiful melting pot of a country even has to defend our stance on this. Did a law pass while we were all sleeping? This is not ethical in any stretch of the imagination. Go Irish! ☘️","Thank You ND!!
Students first!!
GO IRISH! ☘️",One of my daughter’s best friend is from Spain::: and she spent the quarantine with us. I’ll be devastated for my Spanish “daughter” as well as for my own daughter if she is unable to get back to campus this fall.,I’m certain Father John’s statements are heartfelt. It would be naive::: however::: to ignore the economic component.,It’s time for Notre Dame to have a President with conservative values. One whose ideas and leadership control the University ..not one controlled by outside influences.,We even welcomed George C. Wallace and allowed him to speak at the Stepan Center when it was new.,Suggestion .. let’s find out a lot more about who these people really are before you write another letter like this.,Thank you for standing up for these students! The first person my son met on the ND campus was an international student that took their time to make him feel welcome. My two girls::: who attended another university::: roomed with girls from the Netherlands and Spain. They came home for holidays and became part of our family. I can’t imagine how they feel today. Thank you again for helping be their voice! Go Irish!,Thank you for thinking about all these young students that have made the greatest effort to be accepted.,Thank you for sending the letter.,Go Irish!,God Bless ND!,Thank you ND🌎🌏🌍,Proud to be ND.,Love thee Notre Dame!!,Rich Keenan,Proud of our school,Thank you.,Ann Haran Docherty,God bless Fr. Jenkins,Amen,Thank you!,Very thoughtful of ND. Thank you Father,Thank you!,Nicely stated.,Amen to that!,Go Irish,"Gospel Mt 10:7-15

Jesus said to his Apostles:
“As you go::: make this proclamation:
‘The Kingdom of heaven is at hand.’
Cure the sick::: raise the dead:::
cleanse the lepers::: drive out demons.
Without cost you have received; without cost you are to give.
Do not take gold or silver or copper for your belts;
no sack for the journey::: or a second tunic:::
or sandals::: or walking stick.
The laborer deserves his keep.
Whatever town or village you enter::: look for a worthy person in it:::
and stay there until you leave.
As you enter a house::: wish it peace.
If the house is worthy:::
let your peace come upon it;
if not::: let your peace return to you.
Whoever will not receive you or listen to your words-\-\
go outside that house or town and shake the dust from your feet.
Amen::: I say to you::: it will be more tolerable
for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment
than for that town.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

91 He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High:::
who abides in the shadow of the Almighty:::
2 will say to the Lord::: “My refuge and my fortress;
my God::: in whom I trust.”
3 For he will deliver you from the snare of the fowler
and from the deadly pestilence;
4 he will cover you with his pinions:::
and under his wings you will find refuge;
his faithfulness is a shield and buckler.
5 You will not fear the terror of the night:::
nor the arrow that flies by day:::
6 nor the pestilence that stalks in darkness:::
nor the destruction that wastes at noonday.

7 A thousand may fall at your side:::
ten thousand at your right hand;
but it will not come near you.
8 You will only look with your eyes
and see the recompense of the wicked.

9 Because you have made the Lord your refuge:::[a]
the Most High your habitation:::
10 no evil shall befall you:::
no scourge come near your tent.

11 For he will give his angels charge of you
to guard you in all your ways.
12 On their hands they will bear you up:::
lest you dash your foot against a stone.
13 You will tread on the lion and the adder:::
the young lion and the serpent you will trample under foot.

14 Because he cleaves to me in love::: I will deliver him;
I will protect him::: because he knows my name.
15 When he calls to me::: I will answer him;
I will be with him in trouble:::
I will rescue him and honor him.

Message on reopening the University: Pre-matriculation testing::: contact tracing",6/26/2020 19:24,"To me::: it feels like I have to risk my life for ND::: as currently my only way to return to campus is by jumping on a plane and stopping on 3 different airports.
Who will be liable if I get sick because of my forced return to campus? Or while teaching/
working on campus?
I'm outside the US not because I want to::: but because of border closures. The only option for me to return on time is by plane.
Many ND graduate international students are living with ~$12-15 dollars a day (in case you wonder::: no::: it is not enough and you'll be broken if you get sick. Let's not even talk about wisdom teeth here).
So::: another question::: who is gonna pay my debt if I get sick because ND wants me back?

As an international graduate student at ND::: I want to make clear that ND has done NOTHING to create an inclusive return to campus.
I've been in touch with ISSA and read all the letters from the GradSchool and dthe Provost carefully::: and still::: no one can give us satisfactory answers when we ask about how to safely return to campus while being an international students.
ND has tried to make me believe that ""You matter::: your research matters""::: but after looking at all the messages::: it is clear to me that no one cares about my safety.

The application process at Notre Dame is antiquated,This should help the football program,Is payment of tuition also optional?,"I believe this policy is great for equity and social justice::: which Notre Dame helped foster in me. I am so glad to think that this might become a standard practice for the university::: as it seeks to ensure that we have an inclusive idea of what it means to be a top student. Research has been clear for over a decade that parental income is one of the top predictors of a students' SAT score::: in addition to parental education level - these tests better measure privilege than educational potential. In addition::: we know the tests have racist outcomes::: and Black and Latinx students in the highest income brackets (e.g. parents making over $200k per year) still underperform on these tests compared to White students in the lowest income bracket (i.e. under $20k)::: even though we know test scores increase with wealth. Finally::: GPA is one of the greatest predictors of college performance - high school GPA is five times more accurate than the ACT in predicting college GPA::: and this correlation exists regardless of the quality of the high school institution. ACT scores have actually shown to have a NEGATIVE correlation with college completion rates - meaning the better you do on the test::: the more likely you are to drop out. For those who are saying you need standardized tests to ""know"" who the best students are::: you are wrong::: and there is ample research to suggest that standardized tests merely tell us who is most privileged. Instead::: allowing the test to be optional actually helps us live our Catholic values::: of seeing the entirety of a person and all their value::: not just a performance on a four hour test. And this is coming from someone who has scored perfect on the GRE and was in the 99th percentile on the SAT. Love thee::: Notre Dame. https://

4 Now the Spirit expressly says that in later times some will depart from the faith by giving heed to deceitful spirits and doctrines of demons::: 2 through the pretensions of liars whose consciences are seared::: 3 who forbid marriage[a] and enjoin abstinence from foods[b] which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth. 4 For everything created by God is good::: and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving; 5 for then it is consecrated by the word of God and prayer.

A Good Minister of Jesus Christ

6 If you put these instructions before the brethren::: you will be a good minister of Christ Jesus::: nourished on the words of the faith and of the good doctrine which you have followed. 7 Have nothing to do with godless and silly myths. Train yourself in godliness; 8 for while bodily training is of some value::: godliness is of value in every way::: as it holds promise for the present life and also for the life to come. 9 The saying is sure and worthy of full acceptance. 10 For to this end we toil and strive:::[c] because we have our hope set on the living God::: who is the Savior of all men::: especially of those who believe.

11 Command and teach these things. 12 Let no one despise your youth::: but set the believers an example in speech and conduct::: in love::: in faith::: in purity. 13 Till I come::: attend to the public reading of scripture::: to preaching::: to teaching. 14 Do not neglect the gift you have::: which was given you by prophetic utterance when the elders laid their hands upon you. 15 Practice these duties::: devote yourself to them::: so that all may see your progress. 16 Take heed to yourself and to your teaching; hold to that::: for by so doing you will save both yourself and your hearers.",Maged Hassan and Ziad Elbadry::: Notre Dame won't require SAT for your academic year::: as well as many other universities.,This is necessary and may happen for the next year or two depending on how our educational system recovers from the Covid pandemic. Right now there are too many gaps in the way students are being educated and how much these kids are learning so that the groups coming out now to take these tests (if they can even take any tests) are not educated in the same manner as the groups these tests were standardized on. It means you can no longer compare the test scores. There’s been talk for some time of eliminating the ACT/SAT evaluations in college admissions::: this is nothing new. The coronavirus issue just expedited a decision on this matter. There is a lot of research indicating why this test is not the best indicator of collegiate success... it is not just about the well deserving student or the student who worked hardest to get those scores. There are many factors that go into students not testing well who are also well deserving and also work extremely hard.,Does this include graduate admissions?,Dumbing down America,Wow. As a grad::: this surprises and disappoints me.,"And this is why??????? Please don’t tell me standardized testing is culturally biased; as a Guidance Counselor I can show you student scores::: without names::: and show you test scores are not::: are not::: are not going to be affected in the least by culture::: race::: ethnicity etc.

The brighter the individual::: the higher the scores.

I have seen as many students with below average grades score off the chart.... and kids with above average grade score off the chart the other way because of work ethic::: study habits::: curriculum

Mayor Pete works for you.,❤️❤️❤️,The program was unlawful to begin with::: it will be repealed in relatively short order. All parties agree that DHS can and will unwind the program::: it only requires the proper procedure to be followed. This is neither a victory nor defeat for either side::: but the court following procedure to guarantee when the program is unwound it will be done properly,Jesus would totally be hanging out with Dreamers::: the immigrants::: and all the other folks fighting against the powerful to recognize their humanity. Let’s be like Jesus!,It does not matter what Notre Dame says they to are are part of the systematic racism. As long the institution is ok to discriminate against one person::: one group of human beings they are to participating in racism. To many Catholics stop Pro-life at abortion. They do not seem equate it to the quality of life::: health care::: education::: equality for all::: protection against gun violence::: clean water and so much more. They as institution are more than willing to take a stand against gays and forget we are Catholic and and feel very abandoned by a church we were baptized in::: our sexuality was not and has never been a choice::: just like our heterosexual brothers and sisters.

It would have been helpful had SCOTUS actually ruled on the substantive issue in order to send the issue back to Congress for legislation.

Very offensive to blacks and whites.,I hope & pray the Institution of Marriage will be addressed. 75% of black babies born in America are born with no father. Yes::: black lives matter::: especially newborn lives.,Conversation and reflection about our place in all of this is so important. But we can’t just continue to talk about change::: we need to DO something to enact change. What is the University of Notre Dame actively doing today to fight racism and injustice on its campus and in the community of South Bend?,"Unfortunately::: commitments prevent my participation. However::: I should like to ask the question “does not promoting praying for a specific group::: ethnic or racial::: e.g.::: Italians or “people of color”::: subtly yet subconsciously promotes continued divisiveness rather than unity?”. Experience shows that praying for “justice” is praying for a result rather than for the elimination of the underlying cause for injustice overshadows the actual objective for the activity. History shows that until a specific demographic is accepted and integrated into a society as whole it cannot be treated as “belonging” but remains something demanding special attention and “special attention” by its very nature implies “different” which encourages continued divisiveness. Arguably::: promoting divisiveness perpetrates erosion of personal responsibility and individual accountability in favor of collective responsibility.
It is a well-known maxim that “everyone’s responsibility is no one’s responsibility”

The second is this:

Stop making it about you::: and how YOU can look good by reminding everyone about how you own this ONE picture you put in all your pamphlets. Being a person of color on your campus is hard. Because there’s a lot of unchallenged racism in it. Realize that. Change that.

And as for this series of murders and not at all unique cases of police brutality against the black community —if you really care::: put your considerable financial and legal resources and platform where you mouth is and actually HELP the black community. Be of service::: and not just for show.",I’m against the violent protestors but I sense that people are focusing on that as a way to avoid dealing with the obvious underlying problem we have,"Amen.

p.s. It’s sad University of Notre Dame never cared to know the Photographer’s name and give credit.","It was the best of times to attend Notre Dame. I was a sophomore. This was such a serious change for me from my provincial background that used to joke about MLK in my hometown living room when I was in high school. My course essay for Dr. Sam Shapiro was on ""The Black Revolt"" and netted me my first F ever. I rewrote the paper over Christmas break after reading 10 books Prof. Shapiro assigned::: and it profoundly changed my understanding of racism. I acknowledged for the first time that I had grown up a racist! It surprised me.",We are the fighting Irish!,For being a faith based institution with the best football fans on the planet there sure is a lot of hate in these comments,"Please stop trotting out this (beautiful) picture if you are not willing to DO MORE. This picture was taken in the 60's!!!!!!! We need more than words::: ""thoughts and prayers."" We need systemic change! We need Catholics to reconcile how in the hell a majority of us (not I) voted for this misogynist and racist president and his cronies (Steven Miller::: I'm looking at you). And Cardinal Dolan::: how in the world do you justify your disgusting acquiescence for Trump et al? It is time for a renewal in the church for social justice ACTION::: not just words. The Voting Rights Act was decimated. Many Catholics are on the Supreme Court. Stop with the pretty words::: and TAKE ACTION. Fr. Jenkins::: you can hire more faculty of color. You can accept more students of color. You can be as bold for justice as Fr. Hesburgh. He stood up to the donors. I see lots of capitulation going on at ND these days.",Fr. Ted would know how to bring everyone together. ☘ #AllLivesMatter,One of these things is not like the other.. but nice virtue signal! 🙌🙌,If you look at the evidence we've been shown and conclude this was an act of racism::: it is YOU reacting out of racial bias. Be better.,"I would implore people to please read ""The Other America"" speech MLK gave.

""Let me say as I've always said::: and I will always continue to say::: that riots are socially destructive and self-defeating.
... But in the final analysis::: a riot is the language of the unheard. And what is it that America has failed to hear? It has failed to hear that the plight of the Negro poor has worsened over the last few years. It has failed to hear that the promises of freedom and justice have not been met. And it has failed to hear that large segments of white society are more concerned about tranquility and the status quo than about justice::: equality::: and humanity. And so in a real sense our nation's summers of riots are caused by our nation's winters of delay. And as long as America postpones justice::: we stand in the position of having these recurrences of violence and riots over and over again. ""

Further::: both Chauvin and Thao have had a history of violent incidents and complaints regarding black citizens which have led to lawsuits. To question whether race is a factor is beyond naive. Additionally::: as a resident of the south side of Chicago::: I will agree there is more crime but there is an even stronger sense of community. We are ingrained in systemic racism and the problems are for more complex than what the news simply shares. (The latter was in response to a previous comment made making incorrect assumptions about the south side).","Peaceful Protest Run this morning in San Antonio.

"""Perhaps what we most need now::: alongside science::: is that kind of courage and the practical wisdom it requires. Notre Dame’s recent announcement about reopening is the attempt to find the courageous mean as we face the threat of the virus and seek to continue our mission of education and inquiry.""

Read Fr. Jenkins' column::: ""Why Science Alone Could Not Tell Us Whether to Reopen Notre Dame:::"" in The New York Times: https://go.nd.edu/31fb6a

NYTIMES.COM
Opinion | Why Science Alone Could Not Tell Us Whether to Reopen Notre Dame",5/26/2020 14:07,"Fr. Jenkins has been running Notre Dame like a business for years so this decision is not surprising. His responses to discrimination and racial injustice on campus have been a bunch of flowery language that says nothing. No true call to action and no promise of change. Is it so hard to condemn hate speech and discrimination?
But I’m sure he doesn’t want to upset the ultra conservatives who are big donors to the school!

I find it so ironic that he said himself in this article::: “First::: we strive to protect the health of our students::: faculty::: staff and their loved ones...If we gave the first principle absolute priority::: our decision about reopening would be easy. We would keep everyone away until an effective vaccine was universally available.” Should this not be the first priority? Is human life and well-being::: not ALWAYS the highest priority? Apparently not when it comes at the expense of the financial well-being of the institution. You’d think a Catholic university would be able to have their priorities a little more in line with Christ’s teachings than that!",Even though I disagree 99% of the time with the rag NYT. I do think ND should reopen because I want to get back to some degree of normalcy and watch the IRISH play football this fall!☘️☘️☘️☘️🇱🇷,Money talks and B.S. walks. Jenkins is brilliant but has made too many faux pas during his career as Pres. This is another one. I went to N.D.::: and although the studs there are bright they will not take this seriously enough and there will be blood. An insightful parent would hold their child student out for a year. Who cares what the U. of Colorado is doing.,"All schools should open in September. The ""experts"" have been continually wrong about this virus::: so it's good to base decisions on facts and not fear. People can take online classes if they are afraid.",Way to go ND! Thank you for setting a precedence with Catholic Schools! ❤️👏🏼✝️,"This was so well written and needs to be shared with all schools. Our children are our future leaders.

""To possess the virtue of courage is to be able to choose the proper mean between these extremes — to know what risks are worth taking::: and why."" 👏","According to A/V professionals at Notre Dame::: there is going to be a lot of distance learning and employees working from home. So::: the typical campus atmosphere will not be in effect. It doesn’t sound like they are even forcing students to show up.

Why would the school go on national TV and the N.Y. Times now to announce opening up in August knowing they can’t offer the full academic and social experience; only to close down in November? Second wave? Flu season? (I thought we weren’t afraid of the flu).

What about Spring semester? TBD?

The only constant in this decision is the September 29th Presidential Debate. You know Trump is not showing if students are not on campus.

Believe me::: I am now praying for a miracle that the virus disappears. There has been plenty of interaction by young people over Memorial Day and we will see consequences::: if any::: in due time. But::: there are plenty of unknowns and the science on this virus is still developing. However::: close quarters interaction (like dormitory living) is the virus’s wheel house.

It’s not about the low death rate among young people::: it’s the fact that people are asking you to be okay with getting sick. That’s not courage and goes against public health 101. But ND wants you back for sure at least for the fall. Oh::: and you won’t be attending any football games.

So::: according to ND::: it’s masks::: testing and contact tracing. I’m for that. If they get 100% compliance::: ND can pull it off and will be the model example.

If they blow it::: students will get sick and ND may face some liability along the lines of Declan Sullivan. Remember that kid taking one for the team? Undue pressure.

But::: at least::: Notre Dame and its conservative base avoid the wrath of Trump.",No brainer! Open it up,"1) There is no cure.
2) Indiana has the sixth highest mortality rate in the nation with over 6% and growing.

It appears the Greed is Great at Notre Dame::: more important than the lives of your faculty::: staff::: and students.

I wish you would reconsider. You cannot host an 80 student seminar while practicing social distancing. This is madness.

- class of ‘91","Are you ready to pay for medical bills and funerals of staff::: students::: and families they might bring the virus home to? For anyone in the community who might get exposed as a result? For medical professionals?

Is the President of your university personally fine with getting coronavirus and spreading it to others. No matter what those consequences are?",Father Jenkins just compared the reopening of the campus to War and to a fatal car crash. ND might be able to survive the Fall Semester::: but Thanksgiving is the beginning of Flu Season up there and they are ending the semester early because they know a Second Wave is going to occur after Thanksgiving. They are still at least that aware of the oncoming danger. -Class of 2005 and Former Editor for the Observer.,🙏,I think it is a ridiculous mistake to see this virus or mitigation efforts related thereto::: through the lense of politics.,I’m so proud to be an alumni of this school!

The student body::: the faculty::: the entire university was in mourning that entire year. Those who were close to him are still hurting::: I'm sure. A lack of knowledge of the scissor-lift model and an unawareness of wind speed conditions were cited as contributing factors to the accident [https://

Go Irish.",Yeah::: money and image told you to reopen Notre Dame and make the “courageous” decision to put your students::: staff and faculty at risk. That is our Notre Dame family you are taking about::: not soldiers in a war that can’t be prevented. Do not volunteer some of them and their family members to die and call it “mean courage.” And stop trying to draw parallels between yourself and Dr. Fauci::: Fr. Jenkins. It doesn’t mean a thing::: even if you do keep name dropping Aristotle to try to justify a premature decision like this. Frankly::: your opinion piece reads like a first year’s Philo essay and I am deeply disappointed by it. You can and need to come up with a better plan.,"I’m sure there have been plenty of calls between the White House and Notre Dame in preparation for the September 29th presidential debate.

I’m sure the Trump administration expressed their interest in having students in class during that time period.

Or else.",Open it up to get the tuition. Then::: wait until the second wave kicks in and move all classes online. Talking about ethics... sounds very “courageous”.,When it comes to Athletics::: ND is gonna have to find other schools who share his vision about the safety of student athletes.

Latest CDC data leads them to a current “best estimate” fatality rate of 1 in 20:::000 for under 50 with no underlying conditions::: and for age 50 to 64 a 1 in 5:::000 fatality rate.,At least Father has thought it through. He’ll have to stand by the results. God speed.,"I think Father Jenkins makes a pretty clear philosophical point in this. Science cannot in principle give you the moral framework to make decisions that require value judgments -\-\ you can't examine the concept of justice or the principle of fairness with a microscope. You need something beyond science for that. But I hope that::: in today's charged political climate::: his making this obvious point isn't somehow interpreted as an anti-expert view or an anti-scientific
view. It isn't anti-science::: it is in fact very respectful of what science can in principle accomplish::: but it could be perceived that way by people unfamiliar with the distinction between science and moral valuation.

I am personally not sure if the golden mean between the two extremes of recklessly reopening and shutting everything down forever is opening a university of 12:::000+ plus students and a bunch more staff who typically frequent high-density sites (dining halls::: dorms::: the gym::: Debart 101....). I think it still leans too much toward the reckless side. But that's something that reasonable people can arrive at different conclusions about.",🏈💲,First time I’ve been proud of a moral stance made by my university in a long time. We cannot all wait on science to solve humanities issues. If you don’t agree then stay at home::: but you are going to be there for a LONG TIME.

"“If you’re just looking for whether or not someone has the antibody — a yes or no answer — those tests are out there. But simply knowing whether or not someone has the antibody is only part of the picture. We need to know if those levels are declining. Fading immunity would be a major setback to fighting a virus like this.”

Engineering Professor Merlin Bruening and a team of scientists have begun research to develop point-of-care antibody tests that would help public health officials to better understand how an individual’s immunity to COVID-19 lasts over time.

Currently::: these tests aren’t quantitative::: meaning they don’t provide insight into how much of the antibody an individual may have — and that is an important piece of the puzzle.

To do this::: certain molecules from the pathogen must be introduced into the body to trigger an immune response.

"After consultation with experts and health officials to develop a plan to ensure to the greatest extent possible the health and safety of all members of the campus community::: we will welcome students back to campus for the fall semester the week of August 10.

This modified schedule for the 2020-21 fall semester begins two weeks earlier than originally scheduled and will forgo fall break in October and end the semester before Thanksgiving.

The plan includes comprehensive testing for #COVID19::: contact tracing::: quarantine & isolation protocols::: social distancing & mask requirements::: & enhanced cleaning of all campus spaces.

Notre Dame to begin fall semester on campus the week of Aug. 10",5/18/2020 20:36,Very disappointed in my alma mater. Making a decision far too soon. I can't help but think of the 100:::000 lives lost so far::: and my heart aches for their mourning families::: particularly when I see rushed decisions such as this.,This may be the best thing to do::: but people should realize that this probably won't be a return to campus life as usual. Students and faculty will be wearing masks in sparsely populated classrooms. Football games probably won't have 80:::000 people in the stands although students might be let in if they spread themselves across the stadium. Some classes may still be taught partly or entirely online. If one student gets sick others may suddenly find themselves being quarantined whether they like it or not. Social distancing guidelines will be unpopular and uncomfortable and::: I suspect::: widely violated::: especially on the weekends. Hopefully everyone adapts and it becomes a great new experience::: but my guess is it won't be the same as the old one.,The revised schedule to minimize travel is so smart. I hope other universities who are reopening follow suit.,This is a smart plan. I hope other colleges continue to follow suit!,What a brilliant idea! This is wonderful! Notre Dame are for/ are leaders! Maybe the other university’s will follow suit! 😷👍,So happy with this plan and that students will be on campus in the fall!,I just don’t know why they don’t teach virtually. It’s at a loss to many staff and professors not to mention the experience that is what Notre Dame is but this sounds ludicrous to me. Just sayin. I think there’s a plan C that Jenkins forgot about. Just SMH. I guess time will tell. 🤷🏻‍♀️ Fighting Irish! Go figure,Amazing News!!! We planned to do a campus visit this spring. So sad it was cancelled! We will be there next year!!,Maybe they can turn Flanner or Grace into housing again::: and use it for all the new Covid cases. Will the profs and food service have to live on campus? Anyone coming and going to campus can carry the virus with them.,The order of the processes seems to suggest it is more of an experiment and massive data collection than a way to provide a safe learning environment...,"It's heartbreaking that graduation celebrations won't happen for Jake. Maybe Seattle Preps plans will change ss I'm pretty sure there are several other seniors with the same issue
s",How about everyone stop speculations and try to look at even next week this can change with this virus. No one knows what will happen in July unless someone has suddenly found the Crystal ball that knows everything. Try being more positive. It’s getting very old with all the people who only want to predict doom and gloom. Welcome back Students! It’s exciting for them! It’s good news!,"Woohoo!!! So excited and hope this actually happens. My daughter has one semester and she will be done!!! I love the earlier schedule...she'
ll be home for the first time in 4 years for Thanksgiving.",Our son and daughter are ecstatic and we couldn't be prouder of ND for having the courage to put out this smart::: practical plan. Thank you!,"Given that the CDC is still advising not to gather in groups at all::: it's not clear how this is going to work. For example::: a class I taught this spring had 18 students and 18 chairs in the room::: with students taking up the entire space around the table—there was in fact no space for me to sit. That's not physically distant. Nor would it have been easy or straightforward
to arrange a Zoom session for remote students as we are asked to do::: as the computer camera would not have been able to capture the board and the class clearly::: I don't think. There are a great many challenges to all this.",I can see the logic in this plan. Students stay on campus::: don't travel for the 2 breaks and then come back 2x.,"Hmmm. Don’t know how I feel about paying another semester of ND tuition for my student to live on campus and “zoom” into classes again. Not the same as
in-person::: live instruction in a classroom with a professor.",Fantastic news ::: we have to learn to live with this virus ::: it isn’t going to go away,wonderful news for this mom of an incoming freshmen and rising junior. they’re so happy!!,Wonderful. A new beginning full of hope and faith,As they and all colleges should.,Awesome news. Great leadership. Go Irish!!,Im not really comfortable with this decision. Too many questions remain unanswered.,Way to lead the way with courage over fear -\-\ along with critical and rational thinking ND! Well played!,"Come on ND...please don't play into the Fear Mongering too! You have some VERY Intelligent people there::: look at the statistics....d
o the math...LIVE!",So happy to hear this plan. Just sad that this means our son will miss his HS graduation which was moved to 8/13 😢,Yay! Mom of a very happy senior here! We feel confident sending him back seeing all of the thoughtful preparations and precautions being taken. ☘️ Thank you!,I am so happy our kids get to go back to school.,How do you socially distance in a dorm or in a classroom?,So what's the plan when students::: faculty::: and staff start DYING because of these decisions? How many masses will have to be held in the honor of folks who needlessly die?,"Congratulations
on great leadership!","Oh man it’s gonna be hot in those dorm rooms! I feel for anyone on the 3rd and 4th floors of the non air-conditioned
dorms.

Other than it being hot::: I wouldn’t be too upset with this if I was a student. I’d be itching to get back to campus and then having an extra long winter break would be pretty sweet too.","And if I don’t start reading about some serious hazard pay for faculty and staff-ESPECIALL
Y dining hall and dorm employees (most of who are older and are therefore especially vulnerable) then I’ll just be absolutely disgusted.",So::: what are you going to do when cases inevitably massively spike after the 4th of July? You are aware that there many at-risk faculty::: staff::: and students on your campus::: who are now required to stay in dorms aka buildings with hundreds of people packed into them constantly (with communal bathrooms)? Man::: I want things to go back to normal as much as everyone else because online classes sucked to experience as a senior and this pandemic is absolutely horrible. But this is obviously a mistake. You are essentially assembling a mini-city within a city. There are constant streams of tourists and parents flying in from everywhere to ND on any given week. And there are off campus students and obviously staff and faculty that are going to have to keep going out into SB to get groceries and stuff. Which means you cannot keep the virus from eventually making it’s way onto campus. Which means you are::: inevitably::: GOING to have an epidemic in your hands. Don’t let that happen. Wait.,Hallelujah! So happy for my daughter & all the students!,Wonderful news!! This can be handled safely for all especially after all your planning. Go Irish ☘️!!,God Bless the Irish. All we can do is do our best. ☘️,Yay!!!!! Thank you for being realistic!!! ☘️☘️,Wonder if marching band will be a thing this year.,Thanks for letting us know. Looking forward to a great fall semester::: hopefully abroad.,The numbers are in.... Young people (25 and under) have the least amount of risk/infection for COVID19. (few exceptions::: but very few) European elementary schools have reopened and all is steady. It's possible there will be little or no sports but education overall needs to get back on track...,So good for the kids to be back on campus!!,Go Irish! ☘️,This is great news.I'm sure that will also apply to St Mary's 🙏🙏🙏,Short on details (in fairness because they are likely not yet finalized)::: but a good development. Remains to be seen how much the protocols adversely affect the student life experience::: but good for you ND. As a South Bend resident and Double Domer::: I look forward to getting the students back on campus. It's lonely here without them!,I have a VERY happy daughter who will be a senior in the fall. Thank you!,I wonder what this will mean for having 150:::00 plus on campus and 82:::000 in the stands during a football game. Haven't heard any word on this yet. Should be interesting.,So happy for the students!☘️,Well thought out and I know the students will be appreciative.,If I can trust anyone::: it's ND.,Way to go::: Irish!

"The Class of 2020 may not have been on campus for yesterday's degree conferral ceremony::: but a little bit of campus was sent to them.

Each graduate received a memory box containing a letter from Fr. Jenkins::: their yearbook::: a Grotto candle and a stole reading ""Still Notre Dame::: even when far apart.""",5/18/2020 18:46,When are graduated students receiving diplomas? There is nothing on the web and no one answers in the office. Thanks,Those are cool. How can I get one....without the yearbook of course? Proud member of ND'83.,"Way to go!

Congrats to all graduates!","Thank you so much for sending my son's box. I think I had more fun than he did speculating on what was
inside! The stole is beautiful and everything is displayed on our dining room table. We really appreciate everything the university did for us during this time.

"""My dad told me they had met at ND and had been best friends since. For a long time::: I didn’t know what that meant. I do now.""

David Korzeniowski ’20 explores how friends from college create a lifelong connection in Notre Dame Magazine's ""Senior Moments"" series.

Portrait of Friendship | Notre Dame Magazine",5/15/2020 17:54,My husband is still good friends with his ND buddies 32 years strong,This is good!,"Love this. I shared it with my Notre Dame roommates. We met freshman year and still speak every single day 27 years later.
Every. Single. Day. ❤️❤️❤️",I've seen this happen in Notre Dame friendships for a lot of years. I truly believe it's the part of Notre Dame many don't understand. The connection::: tradition and magic of this wonderful school is beyond explanation to so many. You either get it or you don't.,"So after graduating ND '41 my father entered his first post-graduate job
(in NYCity ) on December 7th.",GO IRISH!! 🍀🏈,ND friends are friends for life. Then you go back for various reasons and you make more friends. We are ND. ☘️☘️☘️,Wonderful. Praying my brilliant grandson 2021::: can attend this noble university! God bless Notre Dame,Andrea Foster Goltz Mary Heather Parch Barbara Keleher Garbarino Lisa Mehl Bonnett Erin Wig Bevin C. Kovalik,My dad::: a ‘53 grad::: now has a weekly Zoom with his Sorin College roommates. Three 88-year-olds continuing their journey as if no time has passed at all...the only thing strange is figuring out “gallery view”. The Notre Dame family is forever 🍀,"This is a most beautiful::: uplifting essay. You are so gifted and express your gratitude for your “ new” lifelong friend in a way that resonates. I was in the first coed class::: met my husband there in ‘72.....dated after college then parted. Reconnected in November ‘00 and married the next July. This has been a particularly tough week for him (he is not one to show stress) and I had a rather unpleasant experience today. While I am trying to support my husband::: my ND best friend::: I also reached out to another good friend in our class who became a psychologist. My experience was related to someone having covid-angst and not handling it::: and unfortunately I got the brunt. My ND friend was there for me as I sought some explanation from a professional for this strange experience. She’s miles away but made time for me.

Thank you for sharing your story of friendship. There is so much joy here::: even though you’re missing commencement. God bless you. I know you will do well. You’ve lifted my spirits - thank you 🍀",ALWAYS BE A LOYAL FRIEND.. ALWAYS CUS THAT MEANS SOMETHING...

6 of us just shared a Zoom get together from many geographic areas last Sunday!",I have only one question; who gets to keep the portrait??,My folks met at ND::: 1940.,This is so outstanding. When our son enrolled at ND in the fall of 2016::: our hope was that he would develop friendships to last a lifetime. And he has. Sad to not be sharing a special graduation weekend with he and his friends this weekend...,Love this! My son is a sophomore now and signed his senior year lease for an off campus house last year. I love it that he knew by end of Freshman year that he wanted to live with the guys he’d just met. There’s another house next door with more friends from his dorm and around the corner a house filled with their girl friends.

Remain in my love.
If you keep my commandments::: you will remain in my love:::
just as I have kept my Father’s commandments
and remain in his love.

“I have told you this so that my joy might be in you
and your joy might be complete.
This is my commandment: love one another as I love you.
No one has greater love than this:::
to lay down one’s life for one’s friends.
You are my friends if you do what I command you.
I no longer call you slaves:::
because a slave does not know what his master is doing.
I have called you friends:::
because I have told you everything I have heard from my Father.
It was not you who chose me::: but I who chose you
and appointed you to go and bear fruit that will remain:::
so that whatever you ask the Father in my name he may give you.
This I command you: love one another.”",So proud of our son::: Michael::: on earning his Ph.D. in Nuclear Physics!! ❤,"Congratulations

Father:::
may we whom you renew in baptism

By the suffering::: death::: and resurrection of your Son
may we come to eternal joy.
We ask this through our Lord Jesus Christ::: your Son:::
who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit:::
one God::: for ever and ever.","Gospel Jn 14:7-14

Jesus said to his disciples:
“If you know me::: then you will also know my Father.
From now on you do know him and have seen him.”
Philip said to Jesus:::
“Master::: show us the Father::: and that will be enough for us.”
Jesus said to him::: “Have I been with you for so long a time
and you still do not know me::: Philip?
Whoever has seen me has seen the Father.
How can you say::: ‘Show us the Father’?
Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me?
The words that I speak to you I do not speak on my own.
The Father who dwells in me is doing his works.
Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father is in me:::
or else::: believe because of the works themselves.
Amen::: amen::: I say to you:::
whoever believes in me will do the works that I do:::
and will do greater ones than these:::
because I am going to the Father.
And whatever you ask in my name::: I will do:::
so that the Father may be glorified in the Son.

"Nikole Hannah-Jones::: a 1998 alumna and an investigative reporter for The New York Times Magazine::: was honored Monday with the Pulitzer Prize for commentary for her introductory essay to the newspaper’s landmark 1619 Project.

NEWS.ND.EDU
Alumna Nikole Hannah-Jones awarded Pulitzer Prize",5/8/2020 18:35,Francis Whitworth,William Kemp you should read the publication,"Why they published the 1619 Project -\-\ there is no one view on history::: as our perceptions constantly change https://
www.nytimes.com/
interactive/
2019/12/20/
magazine/
1619-intro.html",ND should not be bragging about this!!!,Well deserved!,This is a disgrace. A politically motivated hatchet job. I'm sure she's a talented journalist but a misguidrd attack on our history is an attack on the republic and the judeic Christian values it was based on.,👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏,"I'm sure::: Mrs. Nicole Hannah -Jones would agree with me::: History is an ongoing research for past truth and factual information then::: transformed into documentations which represent true events and ""subject matters"" always open to rediscovery::: redefining and interpretation.
Therefore::: If your interpretations
of Mrs. Nicole Hannah-Jones Work is Propaganda due to inaccuracies and errors::: then basically all History is Propaganda::: by your standards. Pre-History/
Recent History are documented facts::: however accuracy is still debatable and always. The further we move back into history::: the more interpretative it becomes::: ""an interpretation of someone else interpretations. Cross referencing anthropological
examinations and archaeological discoveries get closer to accuracy::: historical truth::: events and patterns::: yet still an interpretation.
I give all historians::: credit::: appreciation :::and respect for their research::: discoveries and simply put::: hard work. I find it disgusting::: when there's disdain and a lack of respect from Critics when a Black Writer or Historians::: researches::: interprets and redefine their Own Black History. American History definitely lack truth and completeness in terms::: of Black History. Through Mrs. Nicole Hannah Jones's hard work and perseverance::: she discovered and redefined Black History therefore::: American History. For an example::: American History gave us untruth about 'Historical Heroic Figures"" until::: ongoing research and discoveries revealed some of these Historical Hero's was actually murders::: rapers and thieves. Also::: we have been denied indigenous history which keeps American History further inaccurate. You may criticize Mrs Nicole Hannah-Jones but she has performed extraordinary work as a Reporter for the New York Times and has been selected by the Pulitzer Prize Board::: which consist of editors::: columnists::: media executives::: professors of literature and art. I'm sure their Word and ""stamp of approval"" means for more::: than any Critic(s).","As a fellow Alum::: Nikole is family::: and I would never turn my back on family. That being said::: I'm not afraid to call out a family member either.

The premise for the 1619 Project is based on a false narrative of the history of our country. The people behind this project believe that our country was founded on immoral and evil principles when in fact our country was founded on just and moral principles (freedom::: liberty::: and individual rights) that we didn't always apply to various groups as we should have. The great thing about this country::: however::: is that we have been able to overcome and correct those misapplications
and continue to strive to do so wherever we see injustice.

I'm happy that Nikole's writing was recognized. It's just too bad the subject matter was a false narrative of our history.","CONGRATULATIONS

Seems they could have used that in addition to the funds that will come from the reduction in salaries.,Every school owes parents and students REFUNDS,...as opposed to Notre Dame diverting money from their substantial endowment,Why should staff and administration take a pay cut get the money from the revenue from the sports millions of dollars so what don't put new grass on the football field this year,So wonderful. 🙏,Love thee Notre Dame,I believe they already did give it back.,Hats off to all those who sacrifice!

I’ll never forget how decent that was. Thank you ND,I would hope that the university administration would return the government Covid money that was meant for small businesses. No matter how ND earmarks it::: the money was NOT for wealthy institutions,I love that this effort is being taken. although it is a little bit troubling that just a fifth of senior leadership's salaries is enough to fund an entire student relief program,The leaders shouldn’t have $$ taken from them they deserve more!,3 words....use the endowment.,Fantastic example of leadership.,Id wear a mask to watch football no problemo.,Great example on the part of ND’s leaders.

"It’s hard to get a feel for a university without visiting campus::: but this virtual tour from Notre Dame Admissions comes pretty close.

One of our current students takes you through all the regular tour stops on campus. Highlights include the Golden Dome::: Duncan Student Center::: and Notre Dame Stadium.",4/30/2020 18:19,GREAT JOB!! BEEN THERE 4x BUT THIS TOUR FANTASTIC!! GO FIGHTING IRISH OF NOTRE DAME!! BUFFALO N.Y.,Thank you for the tour::: my fellow Chemical Engineer (class of ‘91). It’s been a few years (almost 12?!) since I’ve been on campus so I enjoyed seeing some of the new buildings::: and the old. I’m with you on South Dining Hall - so happy it still looks the same!,"Great video. Wonderful campus. Last time I was there was 2014 to see a Women’s Basketball game. Go Muffet McGraw! I worked there from 2002-2005. My late husband worked there from 2002-2013.
I do have suggestions for the speaking voice on this video but I will not state them here. I enjoyed this look back at campus. Thank you Very much.",Thank you very much for the tour. Awesome job. Love visiting Notre Dame.,Such an uplifting video in this rather dire time. Luckily I have visited::: meeting up with my grandsons when they attended. This was a unique tour. I've seen it several times on great football weekends but this was very personal. I appreciate it so much more. Go Irish!,Very interesting. I would like to visit in person.,What about the endowment money? Lol,Give the money back!!!!!!,WE BLESSED::: TO HAVE A TOURED N.D IN 2015. OUR TOUR GUIDE::: DANI WAS TOTALLY AWESOME.,This is VERY cool. But::: for somebody like me::: who was accepted & enrolled into Notre Dame before ever setting foot on campus::: this may takeaway from the initial awe of seeing the campus for the first time. Even 18 years later::: I vividly remember the feelings I had going up Notre Dame Avenue::: seeing the Golden Dome::: Touchdown Jesus::: ND Stadium::: and the Grotto for the first time. What a special place!,Please start online graduate degree programs! 🙏 Earning a degree from The University of Notre Dame is a goal that I will achieve::: one way or another.,I am an alum (1999) and I learned a lot!! Go Irish!! 💚,Thank you for sharing Alma !great experience !,I love this & knew before it ended that he was going to say “community”. That’s ND in a nutshell. But why oh why did someone not proof the subtitles? Two grammatical errors are two too many for an ND video.,My grand father Warner had a Watch repaire shop on N/D campus in the 1950s,I know it like the back of my hand. But it's a beautiful video and thank you for sharing. Most beautiful campus ever.❤️❤️☘️☘️☘️,Enjoyed this great video very much! I am a 70 year resident of South Bend and have never toured Notre Dame.,Must inspirating and beautyfull campus in USA...,Fantastic tour video- very well done!! ☘️,Its a feeling that you cant explain! Our son graduated from ND & what an experience we all had.,"I am the lost child. Father Ted’s Mary. I finished December 71 because I couldn’t afford the tuition and my major was completed. I have the documents to prove that I was granted a Notre Dame major. I was overlooked. I reached out to President Beauchamp many years ago. He found my records. He added me to the class roll for 72. Now almost 50 years later::: I reached out and pled my case. Before I die::: please acknowledge me and grant my diploma. They brush me off. Father Beauchamp referred me to the powers that be. Regardless::: they ignore the truth. Now they say they don’t have my records.
Father Ted is gone. He hugged me to his chest the last time I saw him.
My father was a Knute Rockne 29 and 30 monogram. He is buried about 20 feet from Knute. I attended team reunions from a young age. I knew the four horsemen::: Frank Leahy::: Hunk Anderson. And Pat O’Brien. They always said I couldn’t attend ND as a girl. I gave up a scholarship to Wellesley and matriculated through SMC when a merger was anticipated. My advisor Sr Franzita Kane guides me through petitioning the ND major. I had to meet the UND requirements and not those if SMC. I had a meal pass and parked every morning at the stadium. I couldn’t go in the dorms::: so I stayed in the library between classes. Father Ted let me use a carrel on his 13th floor outside his office.
I finished summa cum laude. I went on to honors in medical school. I am an eye surgeon. I also have an MBA in healthcare and a graduate certificate from the university of London.
I have proven myself worthy of their acknowledgement
. I am the lost child.
Mary Davies did what I did and got a sheepskin. Mary Ellen Stolz got a lawyer. I don’t want to do that unless I have to.
I am calling out to the ND community. Take me home::: please.
Mary",Thank you for such a great video. So many memories,Awesome video go irish🏈,"Really enjoyed this tour! We come out to 2 games every year and just love to walk around campus.

You guys are assuming that if you're younger than 60 you're immune - you're not! If we open now lots of people will die... can you compromise and agree that we should open partially and slowly? And instead of criticizing ND::: why not criticize the federal government - ask for free tests for everyone.

While NYC has been inundated::: other hospitals are seeing furloughs because of low census numbers (including mine). Further::: To that end I think these models need to be applied regionally::: rather than one to fit them all across the US. It changes the parameters significantly::: and the Rate of contact between infected and susceptible is widely variable across the country. I don’t think there will be a scenario in which we exceed Hospital capacity by 20-fold::: and 5% cumulative population mortality would exceed 15 million in the US.

Gratitude for not cancelling it,"Revelation 22 Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition (RSVCE)

The River of Life

22 Then he showed me the river of the water of life::: bright as crystal::: flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb 2 through the middle of the street of the city; also::: on either side of the river::: the tree of life[a] with its twelve kinds of fruit::: yielding its fruit each month; and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations. 3 There shall no more be anything accursed::: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it::: and his servants shall worship him; 4 they shall see his face::: and his name shall be on their foreheads. 5 And night shall be no more; they need no light of lamp or sun::: for the Lord God will be their light::: and they shall reign for ever and ever.

6 And he said to me::: “These words are trustworthy and true. And the Lord::: the God of the spirits of the prophets::: has sent his angel to show his servants what must soon take place. 7 And behold::: I am coming soon.”

Blessed is he who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book.

Epilogue and Benediction

8 I John am he who heard and saw these things. And when I heard and saw them::: I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who showed them to me; 9 but he said to me::: “You must not do that! I am a fellow servant with you and your brethren the prophets::: and with those who keep the words of this book. Worship God.”

10 And he said to me::: “Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book::: for the time is near. 11 Let the evildoer still do evil::: and the filthy still be filthy::: and the righteous still do right::: and the holy still be holy.”

12 “Behold::: I am coming soon::: bringing my recompense::: to repay every one for what he has done. 13 I am the Alpha and the Omega::: the first and the last::: the beginning and the end.”

14 Blessed are those who wash their robes:::[b] that they may have the right to the tree of life and that they may enter the city by the gates. 15 Outside are the dogs and sorcerers and fornicators and murderers and idolaters::: and every one who loves and practices falsehood.

16 “I Jesus have sent my angel to you with this testimony for the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David::: the bright morning star.”

17 The Spirit and the Bride say::: “Come.” And let him who hears say::: “Come.” And let him who is thirsty come::: let him who desires take the water of life without price.

18 I warn every one who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: if any one adds to them::: God will add to him the plagues described in this book::: 19 and if any one takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy::: God will take away his share in the tree of life and in the holy city::: which are described in this book.

20 He who testifies to these things says::: “Surely I am coming soon.” Amen. Come::: Lord Jesus!

21 The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all the saints.[c] Amen.",Thank you,"Class of 2020: we alumni love you and are proud of you::: and we're sorry that your graduation won't be as you expected. Nonetheless::: congratulations

I think the intent is to say the density of the ion channels is lower in humans. I'm not sure. I'm just a layman::: trying to follow the topic.

Aren't the locitons of these channels where synapses can form? I was under the impression that different channels had different behaviors::: some opening and closing quicker than others.

Cable theory has been around for a long time. What exactly is the new discovery about dendrites mentioned in articles linked to the one above? I believe the dendrites get bigger in diameter closer to the soma and this helps direct the flow of the ions. I don't remember what happens to the ions once the action potential is reached at the axon hillock.","This will allow us to better our understanding of how Human neurons do better and later apply that understanding to make better computers.

DECISIVE EXPERIMENTS
Theoretical Physics is the result of mathematical logical thinking::: so there can be no error::: that is Law is Natural. No controversy! The problem is that: Nature poses a problem::: correct inference gives correct results::: then does not say anything. But the right inference that produces false results is something worth discussing. Either the problem is wrong::: or we have not understood the problem correctly? Let's consider the following fantasy experiment to meditate together on our knowledge about nature right or not? Place the light source between the two flat mirrors::: the light from the source will fly to one mirror::: and then reflect on the other mirror and so on. Then::: when the light source is turned off::: the light must remain on the mirror for a certain period time::: but in fact::: when all the light sources on the mirror face are turned off immediately::: without being left on the mirror even though 1 / billion seconds. Serial connection of 2 bulbs to a 300:::000 km long circuit::: arranged so that the 2 bulbs are right in front of our eyes. When you turn on the switch will the bulbs light up simultaneously or turn 1 second apart? (speed of light C = 300:::000 km/s). The bulbs will light up at the same time as soon as the switch is switched on because the bulbs light only when there is a current in the closed circuit::: furthermore in this case it is impossible to say which bulb is the first bulb which is the last bulb. The electronic environment exists everywhere in the conductor that operates on the principle of simultaneously between force and reaction force. So::: too::: once covered from the source to our eyes::: we only see the present image of the source::: not the past as physicists today think. Through this we can see that::: there is no way that the current is the directional displacement of the charges in the wire and the light is not the movement of the photons from the source to the eye of the observer::: which is the form of drive::: according to the principle of force and jet acting in the physical environment. The phenomenon of constant speed of light for all frames of reference::: i.e. whether it flies forwards or backward at approximately the speed of light::: the light from the light source reaching the observer is always the constant C = 300:::000 km/s::: asserted that we can only see the present image of the source but cannot see its past image. This is an unacceptable violation of mathematics::: no matter what the argument is made::: like Einstein's theory of relativity. The problem here is our conception::: not mathematical reasoning. We including the eminent scientists in the world today::: have misconceptions about the speed of light. When it comes to speed::: it may to the movement of objects (matter) through space::: but the speed of light is not. Imagine a series of bulbs standing still and being lit one after another starting from the first to the last at the speed of light::: we will see that that series of bulbs is no different than a ray of light::: that is how light works. It is the constant constancy of the speed of light that is affirmed::: the photon is always standing still::: acting as the light bulb to transmit light from the source everywhere::: whether it moves with anything. At what speed we still see the photon bulbs are lit in turn at C = 300:::000 km/s and completely do not contradict the Galileo principle. Since it is not possible to distinguish one photon from another::: space must be regarded as a continuous medium of photons::: transmitting the interaction on the principle of simultaneous force and reaction. That means once the light from the source comes to us::: from that moment on we always see an instant image of the source at that moment. So the current science still does not understand what the true nature of light is::: only new knowledge from the Spin theory can solve this problem thoroughly only. Finally let‚Äôs thinking about:
IT IS VERY EASY TO MAKE MEN FOOL THAN MAKE THEM CLEVER. Mark Tuwain.
Nowadays::: it is impossible to make the mankind believe in that‚Äôs the light ray or the radiation rays are as propeller transmission of domino but not the inertial moving of the articles.
When you look at the mirror every things appear as the same as you look into the Universe by yours eyes. All of the Universe::: from the leaf in the garden to a star in remote distances are place on the plane of the mirror::: that‚Äôs mean the images of the Universe disregard how far theirs distances appear instantly as the same moment as you look at the mirror. So we could only see the instant image of the Universe but not the past image of the Universe as it have been belief so far.

Comirnaty is approved by FDA. It is the same formulation that is protected under the EUA for 16+ and the same formulation for 12 to 15-year-olds.

But the difference is the EUA version label has protection under CICP for liability from injury and death. Comirnaty does not.

If someone gets Comirnaty and suffers a adverse reaction right now they person could sue the manufacturer for liability issues. That is why Pfizer is saying community is not available yet. And why this IS like a bait and switch.

What a great time!,"I propose to you my own theory (CiCle Zac Theory) which explains how everything works. It is supported by diffirent proven evedinces::: observations from the reality and existing theories. CiCle Zac theory tells how the time starts::: how are the smallest particles move from point A to point B in space. The CiCle Zac Theory is the God's Programming Language. Anything is can be determined by labeling it with numbers.
The mathematical expression of time is x-y=0. But how?
How will we notice the changes of a thing if it is travelling at infinite speed? but why the smallest particle or the building block of everything has infinite speed?Just think this!! How can you go to 1 from 0? By saying 1. But before 1 there are infinites decimal numbers. You need an infinite speed to travel or to skip. But how that thing will stop if it has an infinite speed? By substracting by the same ammount. The partcle x is moving to left with the ammont of 1 while particle y is moving to right with the ammount of 1 too. When they hit each other they will stop because they have the same ammounts.
x-y=0::: 1-1=0. When the speed of the particle is 0 it will stop. And you will notice the change in position or point in space of those particles involved because you cant notice a particle that move in an infinite speed. You can only notice it when it change its position? But how will you say that it chabge it point or position in space? When it has an 0 speed or it stops.

Nice .,Thanks a lot guys!!more power on you all!!,üëåüèΩüí™üèºüëçüèæ,"Proposal to reduce fuel consumption by up to 40% with the FGS System designed and patented in Argentina. My name is Gustavo Adrian Juliani::: DNI 18549854 resident in Villa Gesell::: Buenos Aires::: Argentina. I am the Owner Manager of the FGS Patented Fuel Saving System. I am writing to you on the occasion of::: as discussed above::: the search for support to make free delivery of said fuel saving system for use in state vehicles in Argentina and all Latin American countries::: as well as the sale of licenses for companies and private investors.

I take this opportunity to request the search for support to finish a project that supplants everything known in the energy system. The project is an unlimited energy system with no maintenance cost and with a useful life of 5 centuries and 0 pollution::: with which we hope to generate the 4th industrial revolution::: by performance::: costs::: useful life and zero emissions in pollution.

Design and operation FGS:

Designed to reduce consumption::: pollution and maintenance costs::: we aim to reduce the consumer market with our FGS system::: (gas manufacturing by suction). Being a simple installation::: it does not have any maintenance::: we install it in about 2 hours. and it is designed and also works in vehicles that have CNG equipment::: since FGS works if the engine turns and the original components of the vehicle are in proper working order::: more autonomy is obtained by using the vehicle with FGS and CNG::: improving engine performance. . FGS works automatically with the engine ignition::: it does not have any keys or contactors for its operation::: since it is basically by a thermodynamic process that initiates the transformation of the state of liquid fuel to gaseous by means of the engine's intake system::: which The engine will be used as a partial combustion medium. Said generated gas is absorbed by the engine through its admission which enriches the gases and this generates an optimization of combustion which is captured by the lambda probe that will cause said probe to send a correction in the signal to the ECU of the vehicle so that it sends less pulsation time to the fuel injectors::: in this way the consumption in liquid state is reduced. As an example with the FGS system we register a variant in the vehicle due to the reduction of time in PMS (pulsations per milli seconds ) in the signal that make the injectors work::: they send less fuel in liquid state::: this is registered by the original consumption meter on the vehicle's dashboard where you can check the savings and this will improve combustion::: since by improving said combustion and reduce consumption in liquid state::: will generate a reduction in the formation of carbon in the combustion chamber::: which generates less contamination to the oil of this shape lengthens the useful life of the oil and reduces contamination.

7. BENEFITS OF THE FGS SYSTEM:

The benefits it brings to the economy and the environment is up to 40% savings in consumption::: and reduces pollution with greater power::: FGS exceeds the useful life or warranties of automotive manufacturers::: ending the consumer market and saving on maintenance and giving the public a system that generates financial culture and ecological awareness for the user.

Installation values with licenses for use in one year::: per unit.

‚óè Low and mid-range vehicles up to 1400 CC. U $ S 115

... Most of the tests that doctors use to cancer diagnose ‚Äî such as mammography::: colonoscopy::: and CT scans ‚Äî are based on imaging. More recently::: researchers have also developed molecular diagnostics that can detect specific cancer-associat
ed molecules that circulate in bodily fluids like blood or urine. MIT engineers have now created a new diagnostic nanoparticle that combines both of these features: It can reveal the presence of cancerous proteins through a urine test ::: and it functions as an imaging agent::: pinpointing the tumor location. In principle::: this diagnostic could be used to detect cancer anywhere in the body::: including tumors that have metastasized from their original locations. to both primary tumors and their metastases. It can trigger a urinary signal and also allow us to visualize where the tumors are:::‚Äù says Sangeeta Bhatia::: the John and Dorothy Wilson Professor of Health Sciences and Technology and Elec trical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT and a member of MIT's Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research and Institute for Medical Engineering and Science.In a new study::: Bhatia and her colleagues showed that the diagnostic could be used to monitor the progression of colon cancer::: including the spread of metastatic tumors to the lung and the liver. Eventually::: they hope it could be developed into a routine cancer test that could be performed annually.Bhatia
is the senior author of the study::: which appears today in Nature Materials. The paper's lead author is MIT research scientist Liangliang Hao. Over the past several years::: Bhatia has been developing cancer diagnostics that work by generating synthetic biomarkers that can be easily detected in the urine. Most cancer cells express enzymes called proteases::: which help them escape their original locations by cutting through proteins of the extracellular matrix. Bhatia's cancer-detectin
g nanoparticles are coated with peptides that are cleaved by these proteases. When these particles encounter a tumor::: the peptides are cleaved and excreted in the urine::: where they can be easily detected. In animal models of lung cancer::: these biomarkers can detect the presence of tumors early on; however::: they don't reveal the exact location of the tumor or whether the tumor has spread beyond its organ of origin. Building on their previous efforts::: the MIT researchers wanted to develop what they call a ‚Äúmultimodal‚Äù diagnostic::: which can perform both molecular screening (detecting the urinary signal) and imaging::: to tell them exactly where the original tumor and any metastases are located. To modify the particles so they could also be used for PET imaging::: the researchers added a radioactive tracer called copper-64. They also coated them with a peptide that is attracted to acidic environments::: such as the microenvironmen
t in tumors::: to induce the particles to accumulate at tumor sites. Once they reach a tumor::: these peptides insert themselves into cell membranes::: creating a strong imaging signal above background noise. The researchers tested the diagnostic particles in two mouse models of metastatic colon cancer::: in which tumor cells travel to and grow in the liver or the lungs. After treatment with a chemotherapy drug commonly used to treat colon cancer::: the researchers were able to use both the urine signal and the imaging agent to track how the tumors responded to treatment. The researchers also found that delivering copper-64 with their nanoparticles offers an advantage over the strategy that is typically used for PET imaging. The PET tracer::: known as FDG::: is a radioactive form of glucose that is taken up by metabolically active cells::: including cancer cells. However::: the heart generates a bright PET signal when exposed to FDG::: and that signal can obscure weaker signals from nearby lung tumors.",Junior Popovisk,Junior Popovisk,"In this case::: what the cell walls do on each other

If approved for use in human patients::: Bhatia envisions that this kind of diagnostic could be useful for evaluating how well patients respond to treatment::: and for long-term monitoring of tumor recurrence or metastasis::: especially for colon cancer. ‚ÄúThose patients could be monitored with the urinary version of the test every six months::: for instance. If the urine test is positive::: they could follow up with a radioactive version of the same agent for an imaging study that could indicate where the disease had spread. We also believe the regulatory path may be accelerated with both modes of testing leveraging a single formulation:::‚Äù Bhatia says. In the longer term::: she hopes that this technology could be used as part of a diagnostic workflow that could be given periodically to detect any kind of cancer. ‚ÄúThe vision is that you could use this in a screening paradigm ‚Äî alone or in conjunction with other tests ‚Äî and we could collectively reach patients that do not have access to costly screening infrastructure today:::‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúEvery year you could get a urine test as part of a general check-up. You would do an imaging study only if the urine test turns positive to then find out where the signal is coming from.

Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúThe magnetic fields of the photons emitted by unpaired electrons oriented in the same direction is the magnetic field of the magnet‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúSince magnets were discovered 2500 years ago::: no one has been able to explain the magnetic field around magnets‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúMagnetic field is Ferent radiation‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúThe electrons in a magnet tend to be oriented the same way; the magnetic fields of the photons emitted by electrons are oriented in the same way‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúMagnetic fields satisfy the superposition principle::: the magnetic field is Ferent radiation.‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúAll physicists::: all scientists::: all Nobel Laureates::: your professors‚Ä¶can not explain the invisible magnetic field‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

What did you learn about the magnetic field?
A magnet is any material capable of producing a magnetic field. The electrons in a magnet tend to be oriented the same way.
The atom with unpaired electrons acts as a magnetic dipole and interacts with a magnetic field.

The electrons spin around its own axis.
Because of the linearity of Maxwell's equations::: magnetic fields satisfy the superposition principle:
H(x) = H1(x) + H2(x)

You learned that the magnetic field is invisible::: but is responsible for the most notable property of a magnet: a force that pulls on other ferromagnetic materials.

‚ÄúAll physicists::: all scientists::: all Nobel Laureates::: your professors‚Ä¶can not explain the invisible magnetic field‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúI quantized the Magnetic field with photons‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúThe electron emits photons which carries the magnetic moment properties of the electron‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúThe electron has a magnetic field due to the photon inside the electron‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

For you the spin is an intrinsic property::: because all Nobel Laureates::: the greatest scientists::: your professors‚Ä¶were
not able to explain the ""spin ƒß/2"" of the electron.

I calculated the spin of the electron::: the spin ƒß/2:

‚ÄúThe Spin of the electron is the Orbital angular momentum of the photon within the electron‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúThe electron has an electric field due to the photon inside the electron‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúThe electron has a magnetic field due to the photon inside the electron‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

I calculated the charge created by the photon inside the electron::: e::: is the unit of elementary charge.
A rotating electrically charged creates a magnetic dipole.

For the electron as a charged particle with the angular momentum L::: the magnetic dipole moment Œº:
Œº = qvr/2 = qL/2m

‚ÄúThe photon is the superposition of a negative photon and a positive photon‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúThe negative photon is emitted by the electron and has the negative electric field perpendicular to the negative magnetic field‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

I consider a particle with a circular helix trajectory.

‚ÄúFerent radiation: when a particle::: Dark Matter particle changes direction emits photons::: Dark photons and gravitons‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

A centripetal force is a force that makes a body to follow a curved path.

‚ÄúFor the particle to follow its trajectory::: the emitted photon pushes the particle with a force higher than the centripetal force‚Äù

"A new MIT Sloan report offers 25 solutions for social media‚Äôs growing flaws ‚Äî such as spreading misinformation::: and lacking competition and transparency. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre now at a crossroads between its promise and its peril:::‚Äù Sinan Aral says.

.
I do have concerns with the ones that suggest trading liability immunity for compliance with ""content moderation regulations"" and ""share data with researchers"" orders. Government (at least in the US) has viewpoint neutrality obligations -\-\ it cannot compel moderation against or audits for any online expression that is not illegal offline::: which already excludes the vast majority of what the hoi polloi consider disinformation or hate speech or discriminatory expression. Any regulation against amplification must be likewise subject to government viewpoint neutrality obligations.
Also::: interoperabilit
y standards cannot compel invasive product integration; at most::: it can compel data export::: which the big platforms already facilitate.","It's ACTUALLY FRIGHTENING...a
nd worse::: as mostbpeople don't realize how far they have entrenched themselves in us. So much so that even we don't about ourselves.","ABC7 news was talking to me but then they stopped or ran it through legal or something. Here's what I messaged: Hello ABC 7 news. You didn't answer me yet. PLEASE HELP ME! VERIFY WHAT'S AROUND ME! I was thinking of credibility things. I was around Kim Baldanado (spelling) years ago at Loma Linda Hospital when this started (1992-93?). I worked as a background actor for 18 months with Kelly Calls (1994-1995) that's how I met all these different industry people. Bill Murray even gave me an AFTRA/SAG card and I turned it down. Listen to this one::: I interviewed with CNN to be the Project Engineer for all SAT trucks in SoCal. My contact at CNN was David Dubiel and I interviewed with Jim Brown (Director of Engineering::: Atlanta::: GA)! This phenomena is around me and it's predicting things (911::: San Bernardino Massacre::: Covid-19::: etc.)::: but I can't figure out what it's saying to me a lot. Like this::: it starts telling me to find an actress named Christina Applegate. I have no attraction::: obsession anything with this. So I was really careful and found her. They start talking to me saying ""you found ""fruity pebbles"""" and I am going what eat cold cereal? It was predicting her breast cancer in 1994! I was around Patrick Swayze also and the same thing ( he's a super nice guy isn't he?) When there telling me Applegate::: I think they meant Manhattan. I was around Tia Carrera also and it was doing the same thing (""that's it::: that's it::: you found it!). PLEASE HELP ME! I just got out of mass at Our Lady of the Rosary Cathedral in San Bernardino CA. I am elderly disabled and live in extreme poverty. I have a Facebook page::: read what I post out (William Pelto Facebook). IT'S AUDIBLE! not like some religious freak like Jim Jones/David Koresh. I said a kids joke to you ; ""an anchor""::: that's funny. (909)352-9373. I bet you could earn a Pulitzer Prize. The joke I told them was: what happens when you throw a news reporter overboard? They become an anchor!",I posted all that material to Cy Vance::: Manhattan District Attorney; The White House::: Nobel Prize Foundation::: United Nations Human Resources. It goes to the top of these sites (credibility).,"San Bernardino District Attorney:

I believe::: that our DA::: our 2 SBPD Chiefs (Eric McBride (current) and Jarrod Burguan (previous)::: and John McMahon San Bernardino County Sheriff (current)::: CHP SB::: SB County Fire should all be commended for dealing with this since 1992. I posted what follows (2 items) to Jason's office.

How are you doing? I hope well. I would be really grateful if you helped me. PLEASE HELP ME. I am the one in town that has the ""audible spiritual phenomena"" around them. Please help me. It is interesting::: Jason Anderson went to Regency University which is Pat Robertson's project. If you read Pat's bio he states that he has an ""audible spiritual phenomena"" around him which he says is God::: at New Years. Is that amazing.

Hello I hope/
pray that you Jason and staff are doing well. My name is William Frederick Pelto::: I am elderly::: disabled and live in extreme poverty. I am a client with the State of California::: Department of Rehabilitation (tier 2 disabled). If you could please help me in some way::: I would be eternally grateful. In the last 5 years::: I have gone through 12 surgeries and 3 - life threatening hospitalizations::: the last at Cedars Sinai where I had my right hip replaced::: then developed a staph infection::: had a rehospitalizati
on::: revision::: PICC line to my heart and 6 weeks of IV antibiotics. I am a devout::: practicing Catholic and a member of Our Lady of the Rosary Cathedral with Bishop Rojas::: Fr Duong and Fr Alex. I have a formal spiritual director in the Catholic Church.
During this time I have been victimized by my neighbor::: residential burglary (over 2 dozen times)::: tv stolen::: mountain bike::: tools stolen constant harassment. I have had my life threatened (reported to the SBPD)::: property defaced. There is gang affiliation (Mexican Mafia::: Westside Verdigo)::: prostitution::: welfare fraud::: extortion and drug use (heroin). There's been 3 violent murders within 100 yards of my home. This has gone on for 10 years. Recently::: they were raided by the SBCSD on Christmas Eve morning. The SBPD showed up and towed one of there vehicles. I am constantly harassed::: even after all this. I try to use social media to communicate and protect myself. I posted a clever true story to Arnold Schwarzenegger (I know him personally)::: Simon Weisenthal Center (they believe and read everything that I post)::: a list of 50 different agencies::: people::: clergy::: also the SBPD::: SBCSD::: SBFIRE. Truly::: I would cherish your help and/or meeting Jason Anderson personally. If Michael Feuer would come by (I know Mike personally and his Rabbi (Hillel Cohn::: Temple Emanu - El::: Redlands::: CA)). All these people are credible witness's to this phenomena and could verify it.

How are you doing today::: Arnold? I am doing well. I am elderly disabled and live in extreme poverty.
I HAVE A GOOD STORY FOR YOU. I went out there on Sunday (Glen Helen Raceway). I saw a mound of dirt on the ground::: kicked it and a walkie talkie/radio flew up out of the dirt (the track personnel lost it 1-year ago and thanked me for finding it). So finding the radio reminded me of a funny/serious story (TRUE STORY). I work the GP/National/
big races. Some people don't take this seriously (AUDIBLE SPIRITUAL PHENOMENA)::: so I am treated like a grunt out there and around town::: a little (like the SBPD/SB Fire). Pre 911 and SB Massacre. During the big races there's a lot of real ""important people"" all around the track; probably like on movie sets. Well some VIP lost a walkie talkie/radio in the mud::: on the track. They got about 50 high payed ""VIPS"" all over the racetrack with everyone frantically looking for the radio; holding up the whole show and costing the whole event money ($15k). I watched for a while::: then called the track manager on my cellphone (Lori Wilson) she was at the ticket booth. I asked her to speak continuously over the radio. I walked over::: listened::: and pointed to a spot on the ground (in the mud) and said there's your lost object (the VIP'S walkie talkie). Isn't that a funny story? That's a true story. I am UCLA Bruin BSME. I have had this done to me a long time up here in San Bernardino CA::: Arnold. I think::: I am dying from doing this ""audible/
spiritual phenomena"" thing. Please help me with some of your previous contacts in your role as Gov of the State of California. It's ironic::: the noise in the mud story; it's almost exactly what goes on around me! Isn't it? The Massacre/911/
Covid-19 has cost a lot of people there lives and many grieving family members/
friends. Again::: please help me. I almost believe that you could beatify/Canon. what's around me. Peace of the Lord be with us üçûüç∑","Of course::: there must be more ""hidden in plain sight"" variables to contend with::: in this complex reality::: perhaps many more than the gross 25*.","Hi John Echeveria (SBPD Sgt. .; Question: What do you do on the 4th of July?) this is Bill (UCLA BRUIN::: OLRC Catholic). You know what I do is watch a nerdy special on PBS or KVCR. Don't you do media for SBPD. You've had to read all the material that I send you (""audible spiritual phenomena""::: list::: UN::: etc.). You keep attributing this to drug/alcohol use at SBPD::: that is not right. It started on Sept 1992 and kept telling me to go to Los Angeles (Hollywood sets::: Los Angeles::: Directors Guild::: etc.) and repeating 911/world trade center things to me. It was trying to get a person (me) to stop 911. That's a miracle. I almost could have or did. You could admit what goes on::: tell NYPD and NYFD and they would be amazed. These premonition stories are common across the US. If people heard the San Bernardino one::: me. It would amaze them. You could get NYPD::: NYFD to adopt you and maybe strengthen public safety and the city. IT WAS GETTING ME TO STOP 911. On top of that you had the terrorist massacre. It kept predicting that around me and Covid-19. YOU NEED TO DROP DRUG/ALCOHOL AND COMMUNICATE/
WORK WITH ME. I am trained as a UCLA BRUIN BSME and CATHOLIC. Think really hard on this. Tell Eric. They would be blown away in New York. I need your help. It's really tough to interpret what the voices and noise say. 29 years ago they would repeat things to me like FATIMA. I watch nerdy tv!","I did not realise ""Real social world"" was not broken.

Photon Ion winds slip stream for anti- gravity.

#SpaceForceDoD #NASA #MIT #SpaceX imagine photons having a static to it in a way a gravity pull::: now think of photonic dynamics and graviphoton and quaziparticles now think of how electron transport works. Now make a mechanical version of this in a slipstream::: particle filliment

Imagine slips streaming on and electron photon gravity transport with resignators that amplifies the slide almost like bullet trains on magnets instead this is just slip streaming on particle space::: motion resignators split streaming. #elonmusk you can do the same with ion winds.

But photonic winds instead or photonic ion winds and plasma burn draft imagine the images with what I just wrote @MIT photon ion winds.

Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúThe electrons in a magnet tend to be oriented the same way; the magnetic fields of the photons emitted by electrons are oriented in the same way‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúMagnetic fields satisfy the superposition principle::: the magnetic field is Ferent radiation.‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúAll physicists::: all scientists::: all Nobel Laureates::: your professors‚Ä¶can not explain the invisible magnetic field‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

What did you learn about the magnetic field?
A magnet is any material capable of producing a magnetic field. The electrons in a magnet tend to be oriented the same way.

The electrons spin around its own axis. The spinning of electron produces a magnetic dipole.
Because of the linearity of Maxwell's equations::: magnetic fields satisfy the superposition principle:
H(x) = H1(x) + H2(x)

You learned that the magnetic field is invisible::: but is responsible for the most notable property of a magnet: a force that pulls on other ferromagnetic materials.

‚ÄúAll physicists::: all scientists::: all Nobel Laureates::: your professors‚Ä¶can not explain the invisible magnetic field‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúI quantized the Magnetic field with photons‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúThe electron emits photons which carries the magnetic moment properties of the electron‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúThe electron has a magnetic field due to the photon inside the electron‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúDue to the photon inside the electron::: the electron interacts with the electromagnetic
field‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

For you the spin is an intrinsic property::: because all Nobel Laureates::: the greatest scientists::: your professors‚Ä¶were
not able to explain the ""spin ƒß/2"" of the electron.

I calculated the spin of the electron::: the spin ƒß/2:

‚ÄúThe Spin of the electron is the Orbital angular momentum of the photon within the electron‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúThe electron has an electric field due to the photon inside the electron‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúThe electron has a magnetic field due to the photon inside the electron‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

I calculated the charge created by the photon inside the electron::: e::: is the unit of elementary charge.
A rotating electrically charged creates a magnetic dipole.

For the electron as a charged particle with the angular momentum L::: the magnetic dipole moment Œº:
The electron magnetic moment is created by a tiny current I traveling around the area A
Œº = IA = (qv/2œÄr)œÄr2

Œº = qvr/2 = qL/2m

where: q = - e
m = me

The classical result is corrected by multiplying it with a dimensionless correction factor g.
The electron magnetic moment in terms of the Bohr magneton ŒºB:

In quantum mechanics is another kind of angular momentum L::: the spin angular momentum::: represented by the spin operator S. The spin of the electron is ƒß/2.

This means: ŒºS = - 9.2 √ó 10^(-24) J/T

The z component of the electron magnetic moment

Œº is the total magnetic moment::: from both orbital angular momentum and spin of an electron; J = L + S is its total angular momentum.

All physicists::: all scientists::: all Nobel Laureates::: your professors‚Ä¶can not explain the magnetic field.

That is why:

‚ÄúThe electron emits electromagnetic
waves‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúThe photon is the superposition of a negative photon and a positive photon‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúThe negative photon is emitted by the electron and has the negative electric field perpendicular to the negative magnetic field‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

I consider a particle with a circular helix trajectory.

‚ÄúFerent radiation: when a particle::: Dark Matter particle changes direction emits photons::: Dark photons and gravitons‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

A circular helix of radius ‚Äòa‚Äô and pitch 2œÄb is described by the following parameterizatio
n:

‚ÄúFor high speed particles::: Dark Matter particles::: the centripetal force:
F=ÔÅßma
ÔÅß is the Ferent factor‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

A centripetal force is a force that makes a body to follow a curved path.

‚ÄúFor the particle to follow its trajectory::: the emitted photon pushes the particle with a force higher than the centripetal force‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúElectric field is Ferent radiation‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúGravitation is Ferent radiation‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúMagnetic field is Ferent radiation‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúThe electrons in a magnet tend to be oriented the same way; the magnetic fields of the photons emitted by electrons are oriented in the same way‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

This means:

‚ÄúMagnetic fields satisfy the superposition principle::: the magnetic field is Ferent radiation.‚Äù

transaction environment","""Despite tremendous progress in being able to perform calculations with low error rates with superconducting
quantum bits (qubits)::: errors persist in two-qubit gates::: one of the building blocks of quantum computing:::"" said Youngkyu Sung::: a graduate student at MIT. Electrical engineering and computer science::: who is lead author of a paper published today in Physical Review X on the subject. ""We've demonstrated a way to sharply reduce these errors."" In quantum computers::: information processing is an extremely delicate process performed by fragile qubits::: which are highly susceptible to dissonance::: i.e. loss of their quantum mechanical behavior. Previous research led by Sung and his collaborator research group MIT Engineering Quantum Systems proposed tunable couplers that allow researchers to switch two-qubit interactions on and off to control their operation while protecting fragile qubits. The idea of the tunable connector represented a significant advance and was cited::: for example::: by Google as the key to the final demonstration of the advantage quantum computing has over classical computing. Yet addressing error mechanisms is like peeling an onion: peeling one layer reveals the next. In this case::: even when using tunable combiners::: the two-qubit gates were still prone to errors caused by the now undesired interactions between the two qubits and the combiner with the two qubits. Such undesirable interactions were often overlooked before adjustable couplers as they were unobtrusive - but now they do. And since such residual errors increase with the number of qubits and gates::: they stand in the way of creating larger-scale quantum processors. The Physical Review X paper provides a new approach to reducing type errors. William D. Oliver::: associate professor of electrical engineering::: said::: ‚ÄúWe've taken the tunable coupler concept further and 99 percent for the two main types of two-qubit gates::: known as Controlled-Z gates and iSWAP gates. We showed accuracy close to 9:::‚Äù he says. and computer science::: member of the MIT Lincoln Lab::: director of the Center for Quantum Engineering::: and deputy director of the Electronics Research Lab::: home of the Engineering Quantum Systems group. ""Higher accuracy gates increase the number of operations that can be performed::: and more operations mean the implementation of more complex algorithms at larger scales."" To eliminate error-causing qubit-qubit interactions::: the researchers used higher energy levels of the linker to cancel problematic interactions. ""Better control and design of the combiner is key to tailoring the qubit-qubit interaction as we want. This can be accomplished by engineering the existing multi-level dynamics."" ""Qubit errors can be dealt with effectively by adding redundancy:::"" Oliver says::: but such a process can only be performed if the gates are good enough::: with certain error-correctio
n protocol-depend
ent qubits::: Oliver says. ""Today::: the softest thresholds are around 99 percent. But in practice::: crossover fidelities are required much higher than this threshold to live with a reasonable level of hardware redundancy."" devices used in the research ""Manufacturing high-consistenc
y devices is one step towards implementing high-accuracy control:::"" says Sung. ""The high error rates in two-qubit gates allow quantum hardware to solve problems of quantum chemistry simulation and optimization:::"" says Sung. ""Up until this point::: only small molecules have been simulated on quantum computers::: simulations could easily be performed on classical computers."" In this sense::: our new approach to reducing two-qubit gate errors is our new approach in quantum computing. just in time and helps address one of today's most critical quantum hardware problems:::"" he says.

LIGO team member Salvatore Vitale::: assistant professor of physics at MIT and a member of the Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Studies::: spoke with MIT News about the rarity of both detections and what mergers of black holes and neutron stars can reveal. The evolution of stars in the universe.

Gravitational waves from both collisions were detected by the National Science Foundation's Laser Interferometer Gravitational-W
ave Observatory (LIGO) in the United States and Virgo in Italy. The events are named GW200105 and GW200115 for the date each gravitational wave was observed. Both signals represent the final moments as a black hole and a neutron star spiraling together. For GW200105::: the black hole is estimated to be about 9 times the mass of the sun::: with a companion neutron star of about 1.9 solar masses. It is estimated that the two objects merged about 900 million years ago. GW200115 is the product of a 6 solar-mass black hole that collided with a neutron star about 1.5 times the mass of our sun about 1 billion years ago. In both cases

Q: What can you tell from the signal about possible scenarios that might have brought these objects together in the first place?

Unfortunately::: not so much at this stage! The most likely scenario is that the two objects in each binary have been together as giant stars for their entire lives. When they ran out of fuel::: they experienced powerful explosions known as supernovas::: leaving behind a neutron star and a black hole. The two objects in the binary system became even closer as they lost energy through gravitational wave emission until they collided. LIGO and Virgo saw the last few seconds leading up to the collision.

Biblical symbology reveals to us that for God a day is like a thousand years::: and a thousand years as a day; therefore::: in the person and work of the Lord Jesus himself::: his reappearance is revealed on the morning of the third day (beginning of the third millennium::: 21st century). Sacred Scripture also reveals that the time given to the Church's mission is two days (two thousand years)::: which end in 2033::: since the Church was founded in the year 33. The next facts that will impact the world are: 1- The uprising of the world ruler (antichrist). 2- Martyrdom of Christians and the rapture of the Church. 3- The third world war and the great massacre of the Jewish nation by Russia. After these three episodes::: Christ::: THE KING OF JERUSALEM::: will descend together with his saints::: on the mount of olives::: for the implantation of the millennial government (Rev. 19:15). The war and its end will take place according to Zechariah 14: Israel on the brink of extermination::: and the annihilation of world military forces. Thus will be the second coming of the one who was killed and revived. In this glorious episode many will die::: but others will be preserved on earth. Being the conqueror of all armies::: the world comes to belong to Christ::: the King of Jerusalem. (Rev. 11:15). Now::: we::: incorruptible disciples::: for a thousand years::: will reorganize planet earth (the only planet with intelligent life). 1- The Judiciary System will be extinguished. 2- Police and armies from all over the world will have new and unique command. 3- Traffics and militias will be extinguished::: now Christianity reigns in the scepter of the Gospel. 4- Nobody else will say my door or my house::: everything will be from the conqueror of the valley of Armageddon. 5- The Creator of the coronavirus::: will exterminate all pests::: automatically sentencing Science to its end. 6- The world speaks one language again (Gen. 11: 1). 7- We will not eat meat::: there will be no blood shed in the personal kingdom of Jesus Christ. 8- All pagan temples::: catholics::: spiritists::: assemblies of god::: baptists::: and movements called evangelicals will be sealed at the disposal of the Great King of Jerusalem::: and no spiritual entity will ever be mentioned again. Truth and justice assume their throne over humanity. Soon::: after the coronavirus::: we will have hunger::: pests::: plagues::: and a class of self-loving political leaders who::: like leeches::: will not get enough of their robberies and murders::: taking advantage of catastrophes to get rich::: they have until 2033 to settle accounts. The curriculum of the faculties will undergo changes::: and my brothers and I will witness in the Universities::: where all the Constitutions will be extinguished::: and the Glorious Gospel of the Kingdom will be taught to all people::: then the end will come (Matt. 24:14).

Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúElectric charge doesn't exist::: was invented by scientists::: because they were not capable to explain the electric charge and what is inside the electron!‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúAll physicists::: all scientists::: all Nobel Laureates::: your professors‚Ä¶can not explain how the electric field acts between two charges.‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

What did you learn about the electric field?

The electric field or the E-field is a physical field that surrounds every electric charge and exerts force on all other charges in the field::: either attracting or repelling them.

The electric field is defined mathematically as a vector field.

The Coulomb force on a charge of magnitude q at any point in space is equal to F=qE::: the product of the charge and the electric field at that point.

Because of the linearity of Maxwell's equations::: electric fields satisfy the superposition principle:
E(x) = E1(x) + E2(x)

Œ¶ the electric potential::: E = -ÔÉë Œ¶ is analogous to the gravitational potential. Mass is sometimes called ‚Äògravitational charge‚Äô.

This implies similarities between the electric field E and the gravitational field g or their associated potentials.

All physicists::: all scientists::: all Nobel Laureates::: your professors‚Ä¶can not explain this thing: rub a comb through your hair and use it to lift pieces of paper.

An electron will move away from another negative charge::: and towards a positive charge. The force experienced by a charge is F = E‚ãÖq

In Ferent Quantum Gravity:

‚ÄúThe electron is composed of a photon and a Dark Matter electron‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúThe positron is composed of a photon and a Dark Matter electron‚Äù

‚ÄúElectric field is photons‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúElectric charge doesn't exist::: was invented by scientists because they were not capable to explain the electric charge and what is inside the electron!‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúThe photon is the superposition of a negative photon and a positive photon‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúThe negative photon is emitted by the electron and has the negative electric field perpendicular to the negative magnetic field‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúThe negative photon carries the electric charge properties and the magnetic moment properties of the electron‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúThe photon with the energy higher than 1.022 MeV near a nucleus is split in a negative photon and a positive photon. An electron is produced from the negative photon and a positron is produced from the positive photon‚Äù

‚ÄúTo oscillate the hydrogen atom emits photons and gravitons‚Äù

I even doubt that the spring shaped ‚Äúdevices‚Äù or springs are one of the most important most fundamental constitutions of this large vast universe.,"What if objects move in multiple speeds on an orbit? That means one object can change its speed while staying on the original orbit aka without any orbit change. I must say this is a more advanced orbit and more difficult to maneuver. Some concepts to share:
-Orbit StrechnessÔºöto measure the speed change within ‚Äúone‚Äù orbit. For example: a car is moving on a straight line::: it may slow down the speed to avoid obstacles::: speeds change while the car is still staying on the same orbit. The same happens to space travel. A designed orbit in space may also slow down somewhere in between::: we can call that orbit strechness.
-Orbit Change/Orbit Shift: to observe one object moving from one orbit to another::: we can say leap::: we can also say orbit change/orbit shift.
Why the concept of orbit is so much important? According to our massive observations in space::: we can say that the universe is built upon orbits::: not forces.

Miner infraction ? Where we come from - it‚Äôs a special suit to be worn.",wish her all the best in her research.,"The complexity of milk Nyquist and her team sourced breast milk from more than a dozen donors for her thesis. These samples are given immediately after birth::: about 40 weeks later::: which gives an idea of how breast milk changes over time. ‚ÄúWe recorded many environmental factors that changed::: such as whether the child started kindergarten::: whether the mother started menstruating::: or whether the mother started hormonal birth control:::‚Äù Nyquist says. ""Any of these common factors could explain the compositional changes we're witnessing."" Nyquist also suggested that discoveries about breast milk could be a surrogate for studying breast tissue. Because breast tissue is necessary for breastfeeding::: researchers have historically struggled to collect tissue samples. ‚ÄúDespite producing an important source of early nutrition::: not much is known about the cellular composition of human breast tissue during lactation:::‚Äù he adds. Overall::: the team found a lot of heterogeneity among donors::: suggesting that breast milk is more complex than expected. They witnessed that the cells in the milk were primarily composed of a type of structural cell that increased in number over time. His team suggested that this transformation may be due to the high turnover of mammary epithelial tissue during breastfeeding. While the reasons are still unclear::: their data adds to previous understandings of the field. Other aspects of their findings confirmed some early discoveries about important immune cells in breast milk.

""We found a type of macrophage in human breast milk that other researchers have previously described in mouse mammary tissue:::"" Nyquist says. ""We're really excited that our results confirm similar things they've seen."" Applying his research to Covid-19 In addition to studying cells in breast milk::: Nyquist has also applied his skills to studying organ cells that can be infected with Covid-19. The work began early in the pandemic::: when Nyquist and his lab colleagues realized they could explore their lab's aggregated cellular data in a new way. ‚ÄúWe started to see if there were any cells expressing genes that could be hijacked for cellular entry by the Covid-19 virus:::‚Äù he says. ""Of course::: we found that there are cells in the nasal::: lung and intestinal tissues that are more sensitive to mediating viral entry."" The results were published and quickly communicated to the public. To Nyquist::: this was proof of how important collaboration and computational tools are in generating the next generation of biological research. ‚ÄúI've never been on such a fast-moving project before - we were able to generate numbers in just two weeks. I think the public was encouraged to see the scientists working so fast on this:::‚Äù he says.","among these functional environments that will occur between the child

Nyquist is now a PhD candidate studying computational and systems biology. Their work is co-recommended by professors Alex Shalek and Bonnie Berger and uses machine learning to understand single-cell genomic data. Since this technology can be applied to almost any living material::: the focus was left to choose Nyquist. After flipping through potential thesis ideas::: Nyquist finally decided to work on lactation::: an important and overlooked topic in human development. She and postdoctoral Brittany Goods are now part of the MIT Dairy Study::: the first longitudinal study to profile cells in human breast milk using single-cell genomic data. ""Many people don't realize that there are actually living cells in breast milk. Our research is to see what the different cell types are and what they can do:::"" says Nyquist. While working on infectious diseases at MIT::: Nyquist is no longer interested in researching basic science questions about the reproductive health of people designated as female at birth. ""Working on my thesis opened my eyes to this really important area of research. As a woman::: I've always realized that a lot isn't known about women's reproductive health:::"" she says. ""The idea that I can contribute to this knowledge is really exciting to me.""

Outside of her own research::: Nyquist enjoys mentoring and teaching other scientists. One of her favorite experiences was teaching coding at HSSP::: a multi-week program for middle and high school students run by MIT students. This experience prompted him to think of ways to make coding accessible to students of any background. ‚ÄúIt can be difficult to tell whether it's easy or hard to tell::: because both can scare people away. ‚ÄúI try to get people excited enough that they can learn the basics and build the confidence to dive deeper:::‚Äù he says. After graduation::: Nyquist hopes to continue her love of mentoring by pursuing a career as a professor. She plans to deepen her research on uterine health by examining how different potentially infectious diseases affect female reproductive tissues. Its purpose is to provide more information about biological processes that have long been considered taboo. ""It's crazy to me that we have so much more to learn about important issues like periods::: breastfeeding or menopause:::"" Nyquist says. ""For example::: we don't understand how certain medications affect people differently during pregnancy. Some doctors tell pregnant women to stop taking their antidepressants
because they worry it will affect their baby. In reality::: there's actually a lot we don't know."" ‚ÄúWhen I tell people this is my career direction::: they often say it's hard to get funding for women's reproductive health research because it only affects 50 percent of the population:::‚Äù she says.

Even as a computer science major and two-time summer intern at Google::: biology was never far from Nyquist's mind. His favorite class was taught by a computational biology professor: ""I was very excited to use computer science as a tool to interrogate biological questions:::"" he recalls.

When these 100 thousand parts are considered as their connection to each other:::
In fact::: the event we call genes is related to them.
this is how god connects this system

In fact::: they somehow continue this energy circulation.
or any other body
or sticking to it with bodies
mixed with the energy circulation found here.
with the bodies again with energy mixtures

in fact::: a world environment emerges with all living things.

But here each body is in accordance with their state of using their energies.
on these chromosome structures
instead of autonomous system

or total control of the body
controlled by the body::: especially from the blood cell to its production.

Lung liver or as a control mechanism
especially as digestive and respiratory excretory circulation
these are arranged by the body and re-formed

that's body controlled thinking systems
In fact::: God intervened in them.

he was giving his own divine breath
now with your own breath

these are given
after that::: with his own body system operations.
these are accomplished

This is how the body makes these structures in the form of RNA DNA.
These structures are controlled in different forms in the body.

in these parts of the body you can detail events","here's the thing that maybe needs to gain weight
that is::: microbial entities that the body cannot accept
when bacteria store some important secretions prior to digestion
some of them begin to be held by Microbial entities.
actually there is no protein here
There are oil filling areas

only every cell has a function
this microbial factor does not work
there body cells are separated into other ways
and for those who were together lost their way in this way
in the separated road
actually this microbial factor
the other cell begins to spread by covering it
by preventing blood from entering here
they cut the paths of other cells
so Microbial bacteria allow other cells to collapse in
as the body system sometimes lacks an environment of resistance
because the blood can no longer produce enough

that's what makes the blood come in
and as living things that multiply by dragging it to another place during blood clotting.
this is how the bacterial network system is revealed in the body

A new technique for correcting disease-causing
mutations
The new method::: developed by McGovern Institute researchers::: could lead to safer::: more efficient gene therapies.

Gene editing::: or deliberately altering a gene's DNA sequence::: is a powerful tool to study how mutations cause disease and to modify an individual's DNA for therapeutic purposes. A new method of gene editing that can be used for both purposes has been developed by a team led by Guoping Feng::: James W. (1963) and the Patricia T. Poitras Professor of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT.

‚ÄúThis technical advance can accelerate the production of disease models in animals and opens up a whole new methodology for correcting critically disease-causing
mutations:::‚Äù says Feng::: a fellow at the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT. Deputy director of the McGovern Institute for Brain Research at MIT. The new findings were published May 26 in the journal Cell.

Genetic disease models

The main goal of the Feng lab is to define exactly what goes wrong with neurodevelopmen
tal and neuropsychiatri
c disorders by designing animal models that carry the gene mutations that cause these disorders in humans. Together with gene editing tools::: new models can be created by injecting a piece of DNA carrying the desired mutation into embryos.

In one such method::: the gene editing tool CRISPR is programmed to cut a targeted gene::: thereby activating natural DNA mechanisms that ""repair"" the broken gene with the injected template DNA. The engineered cells are then used to create offspring that can pass on the genetic change to subsequent generations::: creating a stable genetic line in which diseases and treatments are tested.

While CRISPR has sped up the process of creating such disease models::: the process could take months or years. The reasons for the inefficiency are that many treated cells never undergo the desired DNA sequence change::: and the change only occurs in one of the two gene copies (for most genes::: each cell contains two versions::: one from the father and the other from the father). mother).

To improve the efficiency of the gene editing process::: the Feng lab team initially assumed that adding a DNA repair protein called RAD51 to a standard mix of CRISPR gene editing tools would increase the chances of a cell (in this case::: a fertilized mouse). egg or single-cell embryo) will undergo the desired genetic change.","Here both bacterial systems

n","As a test case::: they measured the rate of being able to insert (""knock-in"") an autism-related mutation in the Chd2 gene. The overall proportion of correctly arranged embryos remained unchanged::: but surprisingly::: both chromosomes carried a significantly higher percentage of desired gene regulation. Tests with a different gene gave the same unexpected result.

‚ÄúIt is normally very rare for both chromosomes to be rearranged at the same time:::‚Äù explains postdoctoral Jonathan Wilde. ""The high rate of editing seen with RAD51 was truly striking::: and what began as a simple attempt to make mutant Chd2 mice quickly evolved into a much larger project focused on applications of RAD51 and genome editing:::"" says co-author Wilde. Cell newspaper with research scientist Tomomi Aida.

molecular copying machine

The Feng lab team then set out to understand the mechanism by which RAD51 improves gene regulation. They hypothesized that RAD51 is engaged in a process called interhomologous
repair (IHR)::: whereby a DNA break in one chromosome is repaired using the second copy of the chromosome (from the other parent) as a template.

To test this::: they injected mouse embryos with RAD51 and CRISPR::: but left out the template DNA. They programmed CRISPR to cut only the gene sequence on one of the chromosomes::: and then tested whether it was repaired to match the sequence on the uncut chromosome. For this experiment::: they had to use mice with different sequences on their maternal and paternal chromosomes.

They found that control embryos injected with CRISPR alone rarely showed IHR repair. However::: the addition of RAD51 significantly increased the number of embryos in which the CRISPR-targeted
gene was edited to match the uncut chromosome.

‚ÄúPrevious studies of UST have found it to be incredibly inefficient in most cells:::‚Äù Wilde says. Our finding that it occurs much more easily in embryonic cells and can be enhanced by RAD51 suggests that a deeper understanding of what allows this type of DNA repair in the embryo could help us design safer and more efficient gene therapies.

A new way to fix disease-causing
mutations

Standard gene therapy strategies that rely on injecting a corrective piece of DNA to act as a template to repair the mutation engage a process called homology-direct
ed repair (HDR).

The black hole field theorem::: which Hawking derived from Einstein's general theory of relativity in 1971::: says that it is impossible for a black hole's surface area to decrease over time. Because no object approaching black holes can escape and is swallowed by them.

Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúFor the particle::: Dark Matter particle to follow its trajectory::: the emitted photon::: Dark photon::: graviton pushes the particle with a force higher than the centripetal force‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúFor high speed particles::: Dark Matter particles::: the centripetal force:
F=ÔÅßma
ÔÅß is the Ferent factor‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúGravitons have negative momentum::: negative energy and the speed higher than the speed of light‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúFerent radiation: when a particle::: Dark Matter particle changes direction emits photons::: Dark photons and gravitons‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúElementary particles emit and receive gravitons::: because Gravity emerged at Ferent wall before the Planck wall; because elementary particles interact via the force of gravity.‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

The conservation law states that particular measurable properties of an isolated physical system like energy and momentum do not change as the system evolves in time.

‚ÄúWhen a graviton is generated::: it is generated the same energy and momentum::: but with opposite sign which is received by the elementary particle‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúWhen a Graviton with negative momentum pg is emitted::: the direction of the velocity vector of the particle is changed‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúThe flux of Gravitons around the object is not the same that is why the object starts to oscillate:‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúBecause the number n of Gravitons emitted by a wave is n = Œª / lp::: this means particles with higher energy will emit Gravitons with higher energy‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúThe Graviton energy::: E::: is proportional with the particle energy Ep:
E = k √ó Ep ‚Äú
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúInside the Black Holes the particles have the highest energy that is why Gravitons with highest energy are emitted by Black Holes:
E = k √ó Ep‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

That is why:
All Noble Laureates::: the greatest scientists::: your professors did not understand Gravitation; they did not understand Quantum Gravity.

I consider a particle with a circular helix trajectory.

A helix is a curve in 3-dimensional space.
A circular helix of radius ‚Äòa‚Äô and pitch 2œÄb is described by the following parameterizatio
n:

‚ÄúFor high speed particles::: Dark Matter particles::: the centripetal force:
F=ÔÅßma
ÔÅß is the Ferent factor‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

A centripetal force is a force that makes a body to follow a curved path.

‚ÄúFor the Dark Matter particle to follow its trajectory::: the emitted Dark photon pushes the particle with a force higher than the centripetal force‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

Gravity provides the centripetal force causing astronomical orbits.

‚ÄúTo oscillate the hydrogen atom emits photons and gravitons‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúThe Standard Model is wrong because the electron::: the photon are not elementary particles::: and it does not include Dark Matter particles‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúTo oscillate particles::: Dark Matter particles emit photons::: Dark photons and gravitons‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúI discovered Dark photon momentum:
p = a / Œª‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

My Gravitation theory explains:

‚ÄúThe Gravitons and the Dark Photons are faster than light‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúFerent equation for Dark photon energy:
E= a ŒΩ‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

I am the first who explained Gravity in the frame of quantum mechanics.

The gravitational attraction between two objects is accompanied by a negative amount of gravitational potential energy in the field which attracts them.

‚ÄúGravitons have negative momentum::: negative energy and the speed higher than the speed of light‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúFerent radiation: when a particle::: Dark Matter particle changes direction emits photons::: Dark photons and gravitons‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúGravitation is Ferent radiation‚Äù

My sister told me to contact Prof ALI KARIM +27794333471 who had helped her husband with financial issues and told me he will help me bring my man back.

I was asked to buy materials to help me which I did::: we begun the prayer and results were delivered in 3 days. My husband called me and asked me where I was::: and he came straight to me and confessed how my best friend seduced him::: and he was sorry to fall into her trap and showed me all the messages my best friend was sending to him and promised never to see her again and promised to love me and only me. That evening he took me to a romantic dinner::: Since Prof ALI KARIM helped me::: My business become more productive and empowered than the previously::: my husband is back to the old man I used to know when we first dated and he loves me so much and does everything to see that am happy.

And this would be great for a Saturday morning cartoon on a regular television network.

Salute:::

Tony V.",Love this. This is a great way to reach out to a younger audience and introduce them to STEM topics in a less intimidating way,"Let‚Äôs look at the concept of infinity again( some thoughts).
Let‚Äôs say::: one point on earth moving in a circle::: using the sun as the frame of reference::: the number of orbit changes will be infinite when it moves one circle::: the orbit at this finish line is straight forward at the finish point or the beginning point on the circle. If we just take the beginning point on the circle as the second comparable point::: it also moves by the earth orbit::: if we watch over these two points and control the speeds of these two points to let them be at the same point with the same speed ( sun as reference) when the circle point finished one circle::: then we have something going on here.
The orbit changes of the circle point are the infinitive orbit changes along the circle And the orbit changes along the earth orbit::: while::: the ‚Äústill‚Äù point has only the infinitive orbit changes along the earth orbit which is included in the circle point orbit changes. Thus we have two infinities here. One is the circle shape orbit changes the other is the earth orbit changes. Another thing needs to be noticed is that since we control and watch over the speeds of these two points so that when the circle point finishes one circle::: it will have the same speed as of the still point::: or simply the circle point stops when one circle is finished according to earth perspective. Then the two points will be ‚Äúdropped‚Äù at the exact same orbit when the circle point finishes one circle orbit changes.
My point is that these two infinitives can surely not be ignored to be one infinitive. So next time when we calculate anything related to infinitive::: remember the story of these two points. I am not quite sure about what contents are exactly included in this assumption::: but for sure it exists and for real and not that eligible for being counted as nothing.

to all. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",Congratulations,"https://
amzn.to/3eSByhJ","Congratulations
to all the Knight-Hennessy
Scholars!","These are some important information about the Palestinian issue:

1- In May 2019::: the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics said that the number of martyrs since the catastrophe until now - without counting the martyrs of wars - is close to one hundred thousand::: who were slaughtered in massacres that wiped out entire villages from existence::: between an old man::: an elderly woman::: a child::: a man and a woman.
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

2- The number of people who were displaced in 1948 was close to 800:::000 Palestinians::: and the number of villages destroyed at the time was 531 out of 774 in 71 massacres.
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

3- In 1950::: Israel issued a law called ""Absentee Property"". Under this law::: they were given the right to seize the property of all those who were displaced after 1948
Due to this law::: 350 colonies were established between 1948 and 1953.
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

4- Laws have been passed from the time of the British Mandate to demolish homes for flimsy reasons. These laws allowed for the control and demolition of property even without trial or charge.
And it was said in a text: ""It is permissible for any military commander to demolish a house or building or destroy anything planted""
It means that he can demolish a house over its owners' heads by the force of law!
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

5- The Prawer plan to Judaize the Inhabitants of the Negev desert and displace approximately forty thousand Palestinians::: which targeted the largest area of land::: out of a thousand kilometers that Arab Bedouin communities owned there::: only a hundred kilometers remain!
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

6- Israel built the Annexation Wall at a distance of 708 km. This barrier prevents many farmers from entering their lands without an entry permit from the Israeli Civil Administration.
The permits are for a specified period::: and are for the owner of the land only::: and it is forbidden to accompany workers or other farmers.
This contributed to the general idea: to seize land and restrict the movement of its people.
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

7- In 1969 a law was passed stating that any private property that the custodian of government property considers public property will be so::: unless proven otherwise!
That means the right of proof has been transferred from the oppressor who wants to seize the land to the oppressed who owns the land!
Taking into account that this was 50 years ago::: so the existence of proof of ownership of lands inherited from hundreds of years ago was impossible.
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

8- In order for Israel to seize more land::: it worked to change the concept of agriculture::: as a law was issued indicating that whoever claims to own agricultural land::: if it is not proven that he has cultivated at least 50% of its area::: then it will be considered state land!
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

9- The occupation imposed its control by military order on the lands of the state that was under the control of the Jordanian government.
A guardian was appointed by the military governor.
This guardian has the right to determine which lands it applies to being state land::: and if it is proven after that (in good faith) that it was not so::: the matter will not change and remain under the occupation authority. This resulted in the occupation‚Äôs seizure of 527 square kilometers::: which were under the control of the Jordanian government before 1967 in the West Bank::: and then Israel additioned 160 square kilometers that belonged to the Othman authorities during the Othman Caliphate.
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

10- Between 1968 and 1979::: 47 square kilometers in the West Bank were confiscated for military purposes necessary for the occupation.
Later::: the Israeli Supreme Court said: The seizure of private property with the aim of building civilian settlements does not contradict the principles of customary international law::: if this building meets military needs!
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
11- They built bypass roads that allow Israeli settlers to travel between the occupied lands::: and between it and Israel::: to preserve the fabric of internal life::: and this was classified as an absolute security necessity::: but don't you find it strange that the Palestinians are not allowed to use these roads!
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

12- They passed laws to seize land for the public benefit::: and who decides that is the minister of finance.
The term ""public benefit"" was very expanded::: including sidewalks::: traffic signs::: and even green spaces.
Imagine taking your grandparents' house to become a green space! Only that is how you can describe it!
This was one of the most important things that were the nucleus of settlement building.
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

13- In 2003::: they established an area called the ""Seam Zone"" inside Palestine::: and no one may stay there::: and anyone inside it immediately evacuates it by force!
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
14- In 2008::: they hit the Gaza Strip with phosphorous bombs::: in an operation called ""Cast Lead"".
In this operation::: 1600 people were killed::: including entire families::: such as Al-Samuni family::: which lost 29 of its members!
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

15- The Palestinians were displaced from the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood according to the following decision with any rights or mercy or justice:
""Palestinian families in Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood are given until next Thursday to reach an agreement with Israeli settlers to vacate their homes""!
Imagine that someone enters the house of your grandfather's and ancestors for hundreds of years and tells you you have to leave unjustly::: and to show how much they have justice they give you little time to Hand your land over to those who kill you and kill your children!

Mathematical physics needs quantum computers in order to discover the correct version of this
universe from among an infinite number of different versions of the multiverse in Superstring theory /
M-theory.
Current smart computers are unable to discover the correct version of this universe::: so humans need
quantum computers because quantum computers are different from current smart computers.
Artificial intelligence programs and quantum computers will tackle complex problems in physics and
unresolved problems in physics as well.
Therefore::: we ask workers and technologists to develop quantum computers in order to make them
depend on thousands of superconducting
qubits What we also need is for these quantum computers
to be able to simulate different versions of universes with different physical laws and discover an
identical version of this universe in Superstring theory / M-theory.

You learned that the photon seems to be a point-like particle since it is absorbed or emitted as a whole by arbitrarily small systems::: including systems much smaller than its wavelength::: such as an atomic nucleus (‚âà10‚àí15 m across) or even the point-like electron.

A hydrogen atom is an electrically neutral atom and contains a single positively charged proton and a single negatively charged electron bound to the nucleus by the Coulomb force.

Electrons have a negative electric charge of ‚àí1.602176634√ó10
^(‚àí19) coulombs.
Electrons have a negative magnetic moment -1.0011ÔÅ≠B
The magnetic moment of the proton is parallel to its spin.

Electromagnetic
waves are emitted by electrically charged particles undergoing acceleration:::

The interaction between two photons.

An electromagnetic
wave consists of a coupled oscillating electric field and magnetic field which are always perpendicular to each other.
According to quantum mechanics::: electromagnetic
waves can also be viewed as streams of particles called photons.

Electric and magnetic fields obey the properties of superposition.

Proof for my theory:

Electron‚Äìpositr
on pair production: the photon's energy is converted to particle mass.
The photon must have higher energy than the sum of the rest mass energies of an electron and positron for the electron‚Äìpositr
on pair production to occur.
The rest mass energies of an electron and positron is 2 ‚ãÖ 511 keV = 1.022 MeV.
The photon must be near a nucleus in order to satisfy conservation of momentum::: as an electron‚Äìpositr
on pair produced.

Electron‚Äìpositr
on pair production in Ferent Quantum Gravity:

‚ÄúThe photon with the energy higher than 1.022 MeV near a nucleus is split in a negative photon and a positive photon. An electron is produced from the negative photon and a positron is produced from the positive photon‚Äù

‚ÄúMagnetic field is photons‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúThe electron emits photons which carries the magnetic moment properties of the electron‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

The electron has an electric charge and a magnetic moment more specifically the electron magnetic dipole moment.

A magnetic pole::: a monopole a single point containing magnetic ‚Äòcharge‚Äô from which magnetic flux lines emanate; in the currently accepted model for electromagnetis
m which is based on Maxwell's equations::: these do not exist.

The electron magnetic dipole moment is the magnetic moment of an electron caused by its intrinsic properties of spin and electric charge.

The strength of the magnetic dipole moment may be thought of as a measure of a dipole‚Äôs ability to turn itself into alignment with a given external magnetic field.

‚ÄúThe electron magnetic moment is another proof for Ferent Quantum Gravity‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúThe electron has a magnetic field due to the photon inside the electron‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúDue to the photon inside the electron::: the electron interacts with the electromagnetic
field‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

For you the spin is an intrinsic property::: because all Nobel Laureates::: the greatest scientists::: your professors‚Ä¶were
not able to explain the ""spin ƒß/2"" of the electron.

I calculated the spin of the electron::: the spin ƒß/2:

‚ÄúThe Spin of the electron is the Orbital angular momentum of the photon within the electron‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúThe electron has an electric field due to the photon inside the electron‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúThe photon inside the electron is the charge::: is the electric field inside a volume equivalent with the electric field created by an electric charge.

An electric field surrounds an electric charge; the same thing inside the electron::: the electric field of the photon surrounds the center of the electron.

Electric charge doesn't exist::: was invented by scientists because they were not capable to explain the electric charge and what is inside the electron!‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

The magnetic moment ¬µ::: is used to measure the tendency of an object to interact with an external magnetic field.

The electron magnetic moment or the electron magnetic dipole moment is the magnetic moment of the electron caused by its intrinsic properties of spin and electric charge.

The electromagnetic
waves are synchronized oscillations of electric and magnetic fields.
In Ferent Quantum Gravity the spin and the electric charge are not intrinsic properties:

‚ÄúThe electron has a magnetic field due to the photon inside the electron‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

I calculated the charge created by the photon inside the electron::: e::: is the unit of elementary charge.
A rotating electrically charged creates a magnetic dipole.

‚ÄúInside the electron::: the rotating electrically charged has the speed of light‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

For the electron as a charged particle with the angular momentum L::: the magnetic dipole moment Œº:
The electron magnetic moment is created by a tiny current I traveling around the area A
Œº = IA = (qv/2œÄr)œÄr2

Œº = qvr/2 = qL/2m

where: q = - e
m = me

The classical result is corrected by multiplying it with a dimensionless correction factor g.
The electron magnetic moment:

The electron magnetic moment in terms of the Bohr magneton ŒºB:

Spin electron magnetic moment

In quantum mechanics is another kind of angular momentum L::: the spin angular momentum::: represented by the spin operator S. The spin of the electron is ƒß/2.

This means: ŒºS = - 9.2 √ó 10^(-24) J/T

The z component of the electron magnetic moment

Where mS is the spin quantum number.

Orbital magnetic dipole moment

Total magnetic dipole moment
Œº is the total magnetic moment::: from both orbital angular momentum and spin of an electron; J = L + S is its total angular momentum.

All physicists::: all scientists::: all Nobel Laureates::: your professors‚Ä¶can not explain the magnetic field.

My husband left me for another woman of whom he was working with at the same place and this really left me with no more reason to live and I even once had thought of giving up on my own life but decided to give myself another chance to live::: so I decided to contact my elder sister and tell her of what I was going through. My elder sister told me to contact Dr. ALI KARIM after help bring back her husband who had left her for years and went and stayed with another woman but when Dr. ALI KARIM did a love spiritual for her::: the husband came back in 4days and from that time they are so happy and so in love and we all see it. So my sister sat me down one day and talked to me as woman to woman and told me I should do everything in my power to get my boyfriend back because he had also broken up with me after I caught him with another woman. I was so hurt when I knew my boyfriend was having an affair with another woman but my sister told me not to cry and be strong and that if I still love my man I should make sure I get him back from that woman. I contacted Dr. ALI KARIM (+27 794 333 471) and told him my problem from where he shared with me a love and binding prayer. I noticed it only took a day and 4 hours before my boyfriend called to beg for my forgiveness and since he promised::: we have been having a happy make up and has managed to stand by his words at least. Yes::: he even proposed to me and we are getting married soon.

The angular momentum J of the electron::: positron: the sum of an orbital angular momentum L and a spin S.
The relationship between orbital angular momentum L::: the position operator r and the linear momentum (orbit part) p is:
L= r √ó p

This means the L's component in the direction of p is zero.

What is Helicity?
Helicity is just the projection of the spin onto the direction of linear momentum.

Right-handed and left-handed helicity:
The helicity of a particle is right-handed if the direction of its spin is the same as the direction of its motion and left-handed if opposite.

The helicity of the electron and positron from muon decay has been measured by determining the sense of circular polarization of their bremsstrahlung by the method of absorption in iron magnetized against or along the direction of motion of the particles. The positron is found to be right-handed and the electron left-handed.

‚ÄúThe Spin of the electron is the Orbital angular momentum of the photon within the electron‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúThe circumference of the electron is Œª / 2::: half of photon wavelength‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúThe angular momentum of Dark Matter inside the electron is very small::: because the volume of the Dark Matter is very small and the mass of the Dark Matter is very small‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúThe electron is a photon around Dark Matter‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

How I calculated the Spin of the electron?

The Orbital angular momentum of the photon in an electron:

L = r √ó p

Where: r = (Œª / 2) / 2œÄ
p = h / Œª

This means:

L = ƒß / 2

This means:

‚ÄúThe Spin of the electron is the Orbital angular momentum of the photon within the electron‚Äù
Adrian Ferent
The electric charge of the electron is negative::: one elementary charge.
The positron is the antiparticle of the electron. The positron has an electric charge of +1 e. When a positron collides with an electron::: annihilation occurs. If this collision occurs at low energies::: it results in the production of two photons.

All physicists::: all scientists::: all Nobel Laureates::: your professors‚Ä¶can not explain this thing: rub a comb through your hair and use it to lift pieces of paper.

The electrons do repel each other.
An electron has the opposite charge properties to a positive charge.

So an electron will move away from another negative charge::: and towards a positive charge. The force experienced by a charge is F=E‚ãÖq

For instance::: critics claim that all of this 'Covid' junk science is massive biotech criminal fraud funding and investment scheme profiteering::: illegal::: grotesque::: and quite deadly human research::: what's termed an iatrogenic atrocity::: and ultimately as this is based on fraud constitutes a lot of assault and homicide. There are now approximately fifty new billionaires associated with this::: all of these massive financial conflicts of interests among government and other scientists and investors in biotech has to be exposed and reined in. Please refer to brilliant molecular biologist Dr. Stefan Lanka who unlike most in his field actually went back and studied a critical historical analysis of the history and underpinning theories and methodologies of virology. He learned that what is being represented in mainstream virology is very false and misleading and that main underlying theories were never adequately controlled::: back tested::: or proven. He is now adding these controls and showing that this is far from good science::: that what is regularly occuring in this industry constitutes scientific imcompetence::: misconduct::: and fraud. Basically::: this 'Covid' and all of these alleged 'pandemic viruses' are computer generated theoretical::: unproven viruses not actually shown to do what is commonly being claimed. We urgently need investigations into all of this; what is being represented about this alleged new virus and about what is actually occurring to patients and care home residents is not at all accurate but highly misleading.
-\-\-

Brilliant Molecular Biologist Stefan Lanka is conducting control experiments which back test underlying assumptions of the foundations of virology::: which should have been done decades ago but have never been done. Virologists are taught crude::: uncontrolled methods which are use in the underpinning foundational theory of virology::: to falsely claim that samples taken from a subject contain viruses which are infectious and cytopathic::: kill cells::: and to falsely claim virologists have mapped an alleged virus genome. None of these assertions have ever been proven using adequately controlled science::: unfortunately. Stefan shows us this in his control experiments::: here's the first one::: below.

In the next phase of his controlled experiments::: he's going to use a same sample with virology's 'alignment' method::: which is a commonly employed method to allegedly map unique genomes for viruses::: to create virology's asserted alleged genomes for several of their alleged viruses such as HIV::: Ebola::: Covid::: as he states at the end of this clip. He's going to use the same sample with their 'alignment' method to show he can map all of these alleged unique genomes all from the same sample::: because this alignment fraudulent junk science is just that::: fraudulent junk science.

Counting pedestrians to make pedestrians count",4/15/21 13:11,"CNN Development Article

The United States Government recently acquired a computer program called Only Helps designed to facilitate and optimize gun checks from any location. It is currently in development by programmers at The CIA and will be merely a months long process regarding development.

The program creator Dan Crossley says that the program will also systematically be the new foundation of ending countless other problems by making known and understood what Only Helps as opposed to what does not. It will be an app for all gun sellers and buyers to use on a phone or computer as well as a portal at the FBI that sends the needed information back to the seller. The process he says will be as efficient as the existing one if not even moreso and make it incredibly easy for sales at Gun shows let alone shops. All that will be needed are a phone with app capabilities and WiFi.

He has been compensated for the program::: the amount being $50:::000:::000:::000
::: all of which he describes as Wood that he will Only Help with. Also along with the program Crossley and his hired team will be building a new Intel Agency called The OHIA::: The Only Helps Intelligence Agency.

Crossley is an artist who along with the program has uncovered and prepared a new era called Wood. ‚ÄúWood along with OH::: WoodOH::: is an art form::: genre::: new way of everything::: new existence::: and more ways of describing‚Äù he says. He will be getting to his music first early in 2022. The program is expecting to be ready for use the beginning of 2022 if not the end of 2021. Crossley will be doing several nationally televised interviews in the fall of 2021 to further explain what need be explained.

‚ÄúFrom Start To Beginning‚Äù

My mission began when Phil Hartman was murdered by a gunwoman. That was back in 1998::: what I describe as the day The 90‚Äôs movement ended::: when Arts and Entertainment even at their peak took a back seat::: and gun check reform as once was kept from took the helm. Before that happened I was a kid in grade school being raised on The A&E of the early 90s::: finding myself collaborating with them thoughtfully on how to get laws passed where early generations did not. As we all brainstormed I watched as they who inspired and influenced me fell one by one to guns and drugs::: to all of which is due to the lack of reform. After Phil Hartman was taken::: I swore to devote myself to ending the gun problem by getting Gun checks set up and all of reform that follows from there. I would figure out how to do it::: how to make it so.

The end of the era triggered me along with they of society who care::: knowing and understanding with they that it is gun checking we need before anything. Get gun checks passed and the rest will follow::: the enjoyment of what has been passed as well as the rest along with it. When Columbine happened I really began thinking::: and came up with a construct::: a metaphor to bring about knowing and understanding::: supporting::: and passing gun checking::: the imitation of a penis with my body. It was not just a start but it wasn‚Äôt the full solution either. More was needed. Then in 2001 9/11 took place. I recall watching at school with the rest of my class as a sophomore in High School and going home early. The nation and world entered a state of panic::: and I realized as it was taking place and figured out they attacked using the gun loophole. In other words::: the trust system of buying and selling guns without checking to see if the buyer has passed checks was abused at airports to enter the airplanes. I knew there and then that a solution was really needed. I started thinking more than ever about all the presets with which I would think collectively with the 90s era: A Man::: A Bro::: The Truth::: and then I reached OH. I sat down in my room as a fifteen year old and thought up and realized how OH is an acronym::: Only Helps::: and as a computer program that does gun checks from phones and CPUs it would close the loophole with the checks as laws. I also expanded upon it and created The OHIA::: which over the course of time I prepared to be made into an official government agency. It was then and there that I realized I had found the full answer. I figured out what to do.

The program would bring about the drug mental and criminal gun checks through the realization of they Only Helping with and among the national populous let along global and beat the filibuster in the Senate. I also realized further how it would end the systemics remaining of racial oppression by being implemented and establishing a foundation of Only Helping. It would also bring about all other reform to follow. It also dawned on me that this would be a process as I expanded upon it further. We had just been attacked::: and with The GOP incumbent::: the party that had opposed gun checks and social reform for so long::: I knew it would be an uphill climb. I would need a government to bring it to that could set up the software to remove the filibuster personnel::: as simple and straightforward
as at. Also::: apps hadn‚Äôt been invented yet::: so sellers in private away from a computer at a gun show let alone a parking lot somewhere didn‚Äôt have a means to check remotely. It overall just wasn‚Äôt possible on my end with the intensely adverse oppositional environment the attack had just created. We also didn‚Äôt have online social networking or media with Facebook::: Twitter::: or Linkedin yet to reinforce with numbers::: so I put it away until the environment was conducive for me to even pursue it and prepared as much as I could in other fields and ways.
As the war moved on::: and modus operandi remained taking out the enemy::: Barack Obama::: a black democrat::: became president. As I reviewed the angles of pursuit I realized that because of OH being a new foundation and paradigm that would end all slave systemics::: Barack as a black man would have to get the checks passed first regarding his oppressed circumstance to then get the foundation up and running. Even with a shooting in 2009 at my alma mater Wesleyan University::: there was still no more I could do as it relied on the checks first with Barack. 2016 came and they were still not passed::: preventing a woman from becoming POTUS as has always been the case. It brought the filibuster party back into the executive branch and continued their place in the Senate instead. 4 years went by from there::: during which time like the years before I further prepared The Only Helps Intelligence Agency and all else needed. Never a day was wasted during my limitations with and constraints from bringing OH to the government to begin.
Then the 2020 election happened and a white male democrat won. This meant with the new foundation‚Äôs public introduction and explanation along with the paradigm of ending slave systemics::: we could begin the program. The reaction of the public was manageable as it would not be extreme with him being white and Anglo. In other words::: with a white democrat we could begin the foundation before the checks as it didn‚Äôt cause the effect that having a black president had and did with he even trying to begin the program before the checks. All it took now were a few meetings with the government and the development of the software to get the foundation up and running to end the filibuster by removing they who do so. The filibusters then get voted out and retire as they do not understand the process and ways etc. of Only Helping. That is where my mission took me: From the start of my commitment to the beginning of the foundation. And now my new mission of building the new foundation has begun.

What did you learn about the electric field?

The electric field or the E-field is a physical field that surrounds every electric charge and exerts force on all other charges in the field::: either attracting or repelling them.

The electric field acts between two charges like the gravitational field acts between two masses::: as they both obey an inverse-square law with distance.

The Coulomb law states that::: for stationary charges::: the electric field varies with the source charge and varies inversely with the square of the distance from the source.

The study of electric fields created by stationary charges is named electrostatics.
Electrostatic fields are electric fields which do not change with time::: which happens when charges and currents are stationary and in that case the Coulomb law fully describes the field.
The electric field can be visualized with a set of lines::: a concept introduced by Michael Faraday. The field's strength is proportional to the density of the lines.
The field lines are the paths that a point positive charge would follow as it is forced to move within the field::: similar to trajectories that masses follow within a gravitational field.

The electric field is defined mathematically as a vector field.

The Coulomb force on a charge of magnitude q at any point in space is equal to F=qE::: the product of the charge and the electric field at that point.

Because of the linearity of Maxwell's equations::: electric fields satisfy the superposition principle:
E(x) = E1(x)+E2(x)

This means the total electric field::: at x::: is equal to the vector sum of the electric fields at that point due to the individual charges.
The total field is then found by integrating over the volume of the charge distribution.

Œ¶ the electric potential::: E = -ÔÉë Œ¶ is analogous to the gravitational potential. Mass is sometimes called ‚Äògravitational charge‚Äô.

This implies similarities between the electric field E and the gravitational field g or their associated potentials.

A proton is a subatomic particle::: symbol p with a positive electric charge of +1e elementary charge.
The neutron is a subatomic particle::: symbol n::: which has a neutral (not positive or negative) charge. The neutron is not affected by electric fields.
The protons within the nucleus are repelled by the long-range electromagnetic
force::: but short-range::: nuclear force binds the nucleons closely together.
A free neutron is unstable::: decaying to a proton::: electron and antineutrino with a mean lifetime close to 15 minutes.

The positron is the antiparticle of the electron. The positron has an electric charge of +1 e. When a positron collides with an electron::: annihilation occurs. If this collision occurs at low energies::: it results in the production of two photons.

All physicists::: all scientists::: all Nobel Laureates::: your professors‚Ä¶can not explain this thing: rub a comb through your hair and use it to lift pieces of paper.

The electrons do repel each other.
An electron has the opposite charge properties to a positive charge.

So an electron will move away from another negative charge::: and towards a positive charge. The force experienced by a charge is F=E‚ãÖq

In Ferent Quantum Gravity:

‚ÄúThe electron is composed of a photon and a Dark Matter electron‚Äù

‚ÄúThe positron is composed of a photon and a Dark Matter electron‚Äù

‚ÄúThe positron emits electromagnetic

‚ÄúThe electron emits photons which attract positrons and repel electrons‚Äù

CMBR:
The CMB is cosmic background radiation filling all space. The cosmic microwave background is thought to be leftover radiation from the Big Bang

In Ferent Quantum Gravity the CMB is not the leftover radiation from the Big Bang!

‚ÄúThe cosmic microwave background radiation is photons emitted by electrons::: charged particles‚Äù

VIRTUAL GLOBAL CLIMATE SUMMIT on April 22-23: 2021.
Your Excellency:::
In recent years::: scientists have underscored the need to limit planetary warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius in order to stave off the worst impacts of climate change. A key goal of the Global Climate Summit is expected to crystalize efforts that will keep 1.5- degree goal within reach. The Summit will also highlight examples of how the enhanced climate change will help ensure a safer future for the humanity through advance innovative technologies::: and help vulnerable countries to counter the much dreaded climate impacts.
Sind Tas Water Council Pakistan is a Think Forum::: working for the future generations to not simply survive::: but to thrive. We want to build a world where the balance between people and the environment::: value and profit::: people‚Äôs beliefs and
actions would be maintained and where human::: natural and capital resources would become a force for good. For that::: we must change and heal the nature of our relationships::: ensuring we respect each other and the very elements that allow us to live.
It is heartening that the ‚ÄúVIRTUAL GLOBAL CLIMATE SUMMIT‚Äù is been convened by you. 40 countries most likely to be impacted by the climate would be participating in the summit. Pakistan has been overlooked Mr. President Pakistan is a big victim of the climate change however we are taking measures to fight against the change. Our main concerns are:-
(i) World‚Äôs biggest glaciers in the mountains are receding at an alarming rate. These glaciers are the primary source of fresh water for hundreds of million people.
(ii) Three rivers i.e.::: Sutlej::: Bias and Ravi were given by Pakistan to India in 1960 for unrestricted use. The valleys of these rivers are already heavy stress because of the climate change.
(iii) This is a humanitarian disaster. A very large treat of forests has already been destroyed.(iv) Pakistan‚Äôs heavy dependence on agriculture and serious water shortages
coupled with a fast growing population is a disaster in waiting. Pakistan is susceptibility to floods and drought underscore its fragility. We ranked as one of the world‚Äôs 10 most climate-vulnera
ble nations.
(v) With a population of 220 million::: the world‚Äôs fifth largest::: there are immense human dimensions to this vulnerability.
The Government of Pakistan has aggressively move to counter these. For example:-
(a) Pakistan::: after a long span of 45 years has started constructing two major dams.
(b) It is well in its way to plant billions of trees.
(c) Pakistan is reducing the use of plastics and is switching to use biodegradable materials.
We strongly propose that this sensitive human issue be reconsidered by keeping aside all political or other interests and Pakistan may also be invited in the summit. All other top-10 population countries received invitations to
Virtual Summit. Some Pakistanis depict it as a deliberate snub.
We look forward to a more human and positive response from you for the sake of humanity and the future of our tiny blue planet.
With Best Regards

It's bad enough that the quality of Technology Review has been completely degraded by this::: but now we're forced to witness it on the official MIT Facebook page too.

As much as it will infuriate the Left trying to push its anti-white supremacy narrative::: let's dispel the notion that the Atlanta shooter was motivated by hatred of Asians. One of this guy's favorite pastimes was going to massage parlors and paying Asian women to ""pull his taffy"" until he got a happy ending. That doesn't sound like hatred of Asians to me. If I somehow inexplicably manage to gin up the idea that I hate a particular race::: I'm not going to be paying women of that race to have sex with me.

But unfortunately this guy also had his head filled up with the puritanical propaganda of Christian Fundamentalism:::
courtesy of the Crabapple First Baptist Church. His roommates described his frequent incidences of self-loathing after he'd visit the massage parlors::: and he had even undergone multiple baptisms at his church in order to purge his favorite sin from his life. Eventually this religious brainwashing won out over the happy endings::: and then the shooting started.

But it's not part of the woke narrative to blame misguided::: Medieval-minded
pastors for poisoning the shooter's mind and turning him into a self-flagellati
ng emotional wreck. So we just force the idea that he hated Asians::: while we conveniently forget his two non-Asian victims. And all of this is made easier because the shooter is white. Well::: perfect.

Is Trump responsible for stoking animosity toward Asians during the pandemic that he selfishly and pathetically failed to contain? Absolutely. He's responsible for most of the over half a million deaths we've experienced::: and he shamelessly used xenophobia to misdirect America's anger away from him. It's a shame there isn't a Hell for him to burn in someday. But we also need to stop lying to ourselves in order to keep a one-sided narrative pure.

And MIT needs to get back to focusing on promoting technology::: not left-leaning politics.

‚ÄúNewton's law of universal gravitation and Newton's third law are wrong‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúI discovered that Newton's law of universal gravitation is wrong.
I discovered that Einstein's gravitation theory is wrong‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúFerent's gravitational force function:‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúThe graviton flux is defined as the number of gravitons per second per unit area‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúIn Ferent Quantum Gravity Newton's law of universal gravitation and Newton‚Äôs third law are wrong‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

In the last 300 years students have learned from professors::: from books::: from the greatest scientists‚Ä¶that
Newton's law of universal gravitation and Newton‚Äôs third law are right.

Newton's third law: for every action (force) there is an equal and opposite reaction (force).

Newton's law of universal gravitation: every particle attracts every other particle with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers.

If the bodies have volume::: have spatial extent (as opposed to being point masses)::: then the gravitational force is calculated by summing the contributions of the point masses that constitute the bodies.

Newton's law of universal gravitation::: as a vector equation:

By Newton's third law:
F12 = ‚àíF21.

‚ÄúNewton's third law is wrong‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúNewton's law of universal gravitation and Newton's third law are wrong‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

1. Newton's law of universal gravitation and Newton‚Äôs third law are wrong.
The interaction between a Black hole and a planet or a star:

‚ÄúThe gravitational force exerted by the Black hole on the planet is much higher than the gravitational force exerted by the planet on the Black hole. Because the energy of the gravitons emitted by the Black hole is much higher than the energy of the gravitons emitted by the planet‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

This means Newton‚Äôs third law is wrong and Newton's law of universal gravitation is wrong:
F12 ‚â† ‚àíF21

2. Newton's law of universal gravitation and Newton‚Äôs third law are wrong.

Because the reaction is not simultaneously:::
because the gravitons which mediate the gravitational force::: have a finite speed::: not an infinite speed.

‚ÄúFerent's gravitational force function:‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

Where:
F - the force between the masses
G - the gravitational constant
m1 - the first mass;
m2 - the second mass;
r - the distance between the centers of the masses
The Dirac delta function can be rigorously defined either as a distribution or as a measure.

This is another proof that Ferent Quantum Gravity is right.

3. Newton's law of universal gravitation and Newton‚Äôs third law are wrong.

‚ÄúThe graviton flux emitted by Earth is bigger than the graviton flux emitted by Moon.‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúThe graviton flux is defined as the number of gravitons per second per unit area‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

This means more gravitons will arrive and interact from the Earth to the Moon than from the Moon to the Earth.

‚ÄúThe Earth attracts with greater force the Moon::: than the Moon attracts the Earth‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

4. Newton's law of universal gravitation and Newton‚Äôs third law are right.

Newton's law of universal gravitation and Newton‚Äôs third law are right for identical objects::: this means: m1 = m2

‚ÄúIn Ferent Quantum Gravity Newton's law of universal gravitation and Newton‚Äôs third law are wrong‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúNewton and Einstein did not understand Gravitation::: they calculated Gravitation‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúEinstein bent the space::: Ferent unbent the space‚Äù

‚ÄúI discovered that Newton's law of universal gravitation is wrong.

Following the Cold War::: the poison of communism not only continued to harm formerly communist countries::: but also spread throughout the world. Since then::: the ideological infiltration of communism has enabled the specter to influence human society on a global scale::: and now many people even think that the dark wishes of communism are their own. Thus::: these people have lost their ability to discern right from wrong::: to differentiate good from evil. The devil‚Äôs conspiracy has been carried out almost to completion.

Communism: A Devil Bent on the Destruction of Humanity

Socialism: The Preliminary Stage of Communism

In the West::: many view socialism and communism as being separate::: which provides fertile ground for socialism to flourish. In fact::: according to Marxist-Leninis
t theory::: socialism is simply communism‚Äôs preliminary stage.

In 1875::: in Critique of the Gotha Programme::: Marx put forward the idea that there is an initial phase of communism::: which is followed by a ‚Äúhigher‚Äù phase. Friedrich Engels::: compelled by changes in the international situation in his later years::: also proposed ‚Äúdemocratic socialism:::‚Äù in which votes were used to obtain political power. Democratic socialism was adopted by social democratic party leaders and theorists of the Second International and led to the left-wing parties in many capitalist countries around the world today. Later::: Lenin set down clear definitions of socialism and communism: He considered socialism to be the preliminary phase of communism::: and communism to be developed on the basis of socialism. The state ownership and planned economy of socialism are part of the initial preparation for communism.

Socialism has always been part of Marxism and the international communist movement. While branches of socialism or left-wing doctrines popular in the West seem superficially unrelated to communism::: they are nonviolent forms of the same root ideology. Left-wing parties come to power in Western countries through elections::: rather than violent revolution. High taxation serves the same role as the outright state ownership seen under communist regimes::: and excessive social welfare is used in place of planned economics. Creating a welfare state is an important aspect of realizing socialism in Western countries.

‚ÄúI quantized the gravitational field with gravitons‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúEinstein bent the space::: Ferent unbent the space‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúThe electron (fermion) is a photon (boson) and a Dark Matter electron (Dark Matter). The Standard Model is wrong.‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúThe majority of Dark matter is the core of the supermassive Black holes‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúI am the first who discovered Dark Matter beyond the Planck Wall‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúThe energy of the gravitons inside a Black hole::: is much higher than the energy of the gluons‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúDark Matter has a density higher than Planck density‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

Ferent density œÅF = mF / lF3 = 8.94 √ó 10^181 kg/m^3

The volume of the universe:

Mass of the universe: M = 3 √ó 10^52 kg
The volume of the universe at Planck wall:

VP = M / œÅP = 3 √ó 10^52 kg / 5.155 √ó 10^96 kg/m^3 = 5.819 √ó 10^(-45) m^3

The volume of the universe at Ferent wall:

VF = M / œÅF = 3 √ó 10^52 kg / 8.94 √ó 10^181 kg/m^3 = 3.355 √ó 10^(-130) m^3

You learned that Milky Way galaxy has a supermassive Black Hole::: 4.1 million solar masses::: 8.2 √ó 10^36 kg::: at its center::: 26000 light-years from the Solar System.

The volume of the Black Hole:

The density œÅ = 8.2 √ó 10^116 kg/m^3::: smaller than Ferent density œÅF

V = M / œÅ = 8.2 √ó 10^36 kg / 8.2 √ó 10^116 kg/m^3 = 10^(-80) m^3

‚ÄúIn Ferent Quantum Gravity theory the volume of the supermassive Black Hole from the center of our galaxy is 10^(-80) m^3‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúHuman can Not travel through the Black Hole with the volume V = 10^(-80) m^3 from the center of our galaxy‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

This means the theories of Juan Maldacena::: J. L. Bl√°zquez-Salced
o::: Carl P. Feinberg and Alexey Milekhin are wrong theories.

‚ÄúBecause the Black Hole from the center of our galaxy has the volume V = 10^(-80) m^3::: the theories of Juan Maldacena::: J. L. Bl√°zquez-Salced
o::: Carl P. Feinberg and Alexey Milekhin are wrong theories‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúHuman can Not travel through a wormhole‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúHuman can Not travel through a wormhole because the Black Holes have a very small volume::: smaller than an atom‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúWhat you learned from your professors::: from your books::: from peer-reviewed journals::: from universities‚Ä¶ about Gravitation::: Black Holes::: Dark Matter‚Ä¶ is wrong‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

The proof that I am right:
Human can Not travel through a wormhole because the Black Holes have a very small volume::: smaller than an atom.
There are civilizations billions of years more advanced than we are and they are not here.

It must be noted that PHOTONS DO NOT HAVE a mass M . Therefore::: we CANNOT USE THE ALBERT EINSTEIN ENERGY EQUATION
E= M c2
in calculating the energy obtained ::: or emitted from PHOTONS.
So::: we are left here with one choice to use. THAT CHOICE is using my new ENERGY EQUATION:::
E= Q U c2.
That is ::: above::: where::: we use the CHARGE Q of particles & photons:::....:::

"Outside of research and design::: my main passion is making music::: writes Alexis Hope::: research assistant in the MIT Media Lab. Just over a decade ago::: I started a band with my friends Matthew Longoria and Kabir Vermouth called Calico Beach Party::: and we‚Äôve been playing together ever since::: even though we live on opposite sides of the country.

The song in this video::: ‚ÄúYou Got Me Bad:::‚Äù is one of the first songs we ever wrote together::: and playing it helps me imagine the sweet times ahead when we can all gather again safely. I love that music connects us to other people even when we are far apart. A song is a conversation with others::: a chance to see inside someone‚Äôs brain::: and an opportunity to learn something new.

‚ÄúBlack Holes in Ferent Quantum Gravity have very small volume‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúDark Matter has density higher than Planck density‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúFerent Matter is Dark Matter in Ferent Quantum Gravity‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúI am the first who discovered Dark Matter beyond the Planck Wall‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúDark Matter has density less than or equal to Ferent density and greater than Planck density‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúI am the first who discovered what is beyond the Planck Wall‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúTwo important walls:
The Ferent wall: here at time t = 1.294 √ó 10^(-86) s were created Dark matter and Dark photons::: with the speed of the Dark photons v = 1.001 √ó 10^17 m/s.
The Planck wall: here at time t = 5.391 √ó 10^(-44) s were created Matter and Photons::: with the speed of the Photons c = 2.997 √ó 10^8 m/s‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

This means:

‚ÄúIn Ferent Quantum Gravity Dark Photons and Gravitons is Faster Than Light‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúEinstein general relativity is a wrong Gravitation theory because does not explain what was at Planck Wall and beyond‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

Ferent density
Ferent density œÅF = mF / lf^3 = 8.94 √ó 10^181 kg/m3

The volume of the universe:

Mass of the universe: M = 3 √ó 10^52 kg
The volume of the universe at Planck wall:

VP = M / œÅP = 3 √ó 10^52 kg / 5.155 √ó 10^96 kg/m^3 = 5.819 √ó 10^(-45) m^3

The volume of the universe at Ferent wall:

VF = M / œÅF = 3 √ó 10^52 kg / 8.94 √ó 10^181 kg/m^3 = 3.355 √ó 10^(-130) m^3

‚ÄúIn Ferent Quantum Gravity theory the mass of supermassive Black Hole from the center of our galaxy is not 8.2 √ó 10^36 kg::: it is 7.3 √ó 10^19 kg‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúI am the first who calculated the mass and the energy of a Black Hole‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúPhysics is much more complicated than you learned::: with Dark Matter‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

This is another proof that Ferent Quantum Gravity theory is right and Einstein Gravitation theory::: String theory::: LQG‚Ä¶ are wrong theories.

‚ÄúFerent matter has density less than or equal to Ferent density and greater than Planck density‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúFerent matter is Dark matter in Ferent Quantum Gravity‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúThe majority of Dark matter is the core of the supermassive Black holes‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúI am the first who discovered Dark Matter beyond the Planck Wall‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúThe energy of the gravitons inside a Black hole::: is much higher than the energy of the gluons‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúMatter was created from Dark Matter‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúThe elementary particles contain Dark Matter‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

That is why:

‚ÄúThe Standard Model is wrong‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúFerent equation for elementary particle::: made of 2 particles::: a Matter particle and a Dark Matter particle::: is the Unification between Matter and Dark Matter!‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúDark Matter interacts only gravitationally
with Matter‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúThe most difficult topic in Science is Gravitation::: because Newton::: Einstein‚Ä¶ tried to explain it without success‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúInformation is lost in Black Holes‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúBecause the elementary particles contain Dark Matter with the mass much smaller than particles mass::: Dark Matter is not detected at CERN‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúWhat you learned from your professors::: from your books::: from the greatest scientists‚Ä¶ about Dark Matter is wrong‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúDark Matter is not ‚Äòinvisible‚Äô::: is not ‚Äòtransparent‚Äô Matter.‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúLight will not cross Dark Matter because Dark Matter density is higher than Planck density.‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

When you look at the sky and you do not see Dark Matter::: this means it is ‚Äòinvisible‚Äô::: is ‚Äòtransparent‚Äô!
Here are 2 examples::: Lisa Randall professor from Harvard University and Dan Bauer physicist from Fermilab::: of what the professors::: the scientists think about Dark Matter: they think that Dark Matter is ‚Äòinvisible‚Äô::: is ‚Äòtransparent‚Äô Matter!

‚ÄúThe electron is a photon around Dark Matter‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

Stealing from Ferent Quantum Gravity about Dark Matter::: Black Holes‚Ä¶it is the way of the scientists. The huge majority of scientists are not capable to discover anything.

‚ÄúBecause Ferent Quantum Gravity is a new theory::: I did not use References‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúNobody understands Gravitation::: because nobody understands Dark Matter‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúDark Matter has another Structure::: based on Ferent length lF = 1.296 √ó 10^(-69) m much smaller than Planck length lP = 1.616199√ó10^(-3
5) m‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

Today all the Nobel Laureates::: the greatest scientists::: your professors‚Ä¶ were not capable to explain Dark Matter::: they talk about Transparent matter because they can not see Dark Matter::: they talk about Baryonic matter::: Non-baryonic matter like axions::: they talk about cold::: warm or hot Dark Matte::: about Spersymmetric Particles as Dark Matter‚Ä¶but not beyond the Planck Wall.

‚ÄúQuantum Mechanics can't explain Gravity because nobody understands Dark Matter‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

EHT picture of the Black Hole is wrong

‚ÄúThere is no Gravitational redshift around the Black Hole::: around the Event horizon of the Black Hole in Ferent Quantum Gravity::: like the red color in the EHT picture of the Black Hole‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúBlack Holes in Ferent Quantum Gravity have very small volume‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

French twins Igor and Grichka Bogdanov published in reputable scientific journals::: and were alleged by their authors to culminate in a proposed theory for describing what occurred at and before the Big Bang.

Igor and Grichka Bogdanov tried without success to explain what is beyond the Planck Wall.

‚ÄúI am the first who discovered what is beyond the Planck Wall‚Äù

https://now.mit.edu/",3/2/21 14:06,Sadly::: Reif is the one propagating these absurd ideas in the school. No::: Living in a community is NOT like being in a high risk lab. NO::: you don‚Äôt need to keep testing constantly after being vaccinated. At least not for some time. These radical ideas like obligating people wear a ‚ÄúCovid Pass‚Äù to enter school are about Control::: not about safety of your young healthy students.,"What is this garbage? No job or college can require that employees or students get a test or a vaccine which has not been approved by the FDA and licensed for a particular use::: sorry. These vaccines have not been approved or licensed by the FDA but have only been given EUA/emergency use approval::: for which no such mandates are legal under our current laws. Anyone at a job or college being misled into thinking they have to get this to keep their job or go to school::: anyone who is coerced into getting these highly experimental vaccines and participating in ongoing safety and efficacy drug study trials for all of these EUA alleged Covid vaccines in such a rights violating manner::: please see below and contact the Informed Consent Action Network for legal assistance! Thank you!

ICAN‚Äôs legal team::: led by Aaron Siri::: has taken legal action to challenge employers/
schools that require their employees/
students to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Employers and schools that previously required the COVID-19 vaccine have dropped those requirements! This includes an employer that did so on the heels of ICAN‚Äôs legal team challenging the mandate in court.

If you or anyone you know is being required by an employer or school to receive a COVID-19 vaccine::: ICAN is pleased to offer to support legal action on your behalf to challenge the requirement. In order to obtain this potential assistance::: please email us at freedom@icandec
ide.org and provide a copy of the written notice from your school or employer stating that the COVID-19 vaccine is required.

Without your support::: our ability to fight these illegal COVID-19 vaccine requirements would not be happening. Thank you for making our work possible!

Medical privacy and freedom is far more important than this kind of propagated fear.,"What is the most dangerous virus in the world? it is a virus ... created from scratch by man! A mutant virus::: which has a potential mortality rate of around 60%::: combined with extreme contagiousness and the virtual absence of vaccine or treatment: The mH5N1 virus. It is a virus of the same family as H5N1 but genetically modified so that it can cross the species barrier and::: therefore::: contaminate humans. In technical terms::: this is a new H5N1 reassorted to be more ""humanocompatib
le"". A result obtained by ""mixing"" an avian strain of H5N1 with an H1N1 virus from the 2009 influenza epidemic (a very contagious human strain). At the risk of a guaranteed massacre: calculations carried out at Harvard estimate that if we apply the mortality rate of H5N1 to mH5N1::: we very quickly exceed one billion deaths! ... This explains why ""the most dangerous virus in the world"" is confined under ultra-high security conditions at the Influenza Research Institute at the University of Wisconsin (United States). Why there? Because it was in this research laboratory specializing in the creation of potentially pandemic mutants that mH5N1 was born::: at the instigation of one of the most renowned influenza virologists in the world: Yoshihiro Kawaoka. Which had already been noticed in 2012 for work on the ... H5N1 ... So yes protect yourself but real enemies! https://

""Right now::: a second Nuremberg tribunal that is in preparation::: with a class action lawsuit being set up under the aegis of thousands of lawyers worldwide behind the American-German

In this respect::: it is worth recalling that this Covid-19 crisis should be renamed the ‚ÄúCovid-19 Scandal‚Äù and all those responsible should be prosecuted for civil damages due to manipulations and falsified test protocols. Therefore::: an international network of business lawyers will plead the biggest tort case of all time::: the Covid-19 fraud scandal::: which has meanwhile turned into the biggest crime against humanity ever committed.

A Covid-19 commission of enquiry has been set up on the initiative of a group of German lawyers with the aim of bringing an international class action lawsuit using Anglo-Saxon law. Here is the summarized translation of the last communication of Dr. X of 15/02/2021

‚ÄúThe hearings of around 100 internationally
renowned scientists::: doctors::: economists and lawyers::: which have been conducted by the Berlin Commission of Inquiry into the Covid-19 affair since 10.07.2020::: have in the meantime shown with a probability close to certainty that the Covid- 19 scandal was at no time a health issue. Rather::: it was about solidifying the illegitimate power (illegitimate because it was obtained by criminal methods) of the corrupt ‚ÄúDavos clique‚Äù by transferring the wealth of the people to the members of the Davos clique::: destroying::: among other things::: small & medium-sized enterprises in particular.

All of those who are in roles to oversee this have failed to do their legally required due diligence on these tests and their use.

PCR testing has been misappropriated
and massively misused. I believe only Florida is requiring labs to publish how many cycles they're running::: most labs have been running more and many times more cycles than is recommended by experts to produce actually useful results. Basically::: all of the alleged 'cases' of this which have been based on PCR testing::: and that's the overwhelming majority I think::: are not actually proven cases at all::: unfortunately. This has been a testing and data disaster and exercise in massive diagnostic failure; a lot of associated 'treatment protocol' iatrogenesis::: illegal human research and mass medical malpractice disaster; but not an actually proven pandemic::: I'm reading. The WHO recently finally put out a notice about associated diagnostics issues but given that the literacy rate on all of this is low I doubt anyone understands much of any of this complete iatrogenic disaster.

The WHO has put out two notices on this recently::: here's one::: below. From this:

'Most PCR assays are indicated as an aid for diagnosis::: therefore::: health care providers must consider any result in combination with timing of sampling::: specimen type::: assay specifics::: clinical observations::: patient history::: confirmed status of any contacts::: and epidemiological

As Figure 22.5 shows::: productivity growth::: as measured by increases in real GDP per hour worked::: increased between 1995 and 2010 compared to the previous 20-year period.

The spread of ever-faster and increasingly less expensive computers üíª has made communication and data processing easier and faster than ever before.

Wear your mask. It may be possible for you to spread the virus even if you have been vaccinated and have no symptoms. https://now.mit.edu/,2/16/21 18:28,Then what the hell is the point of getting vaccinated if you‚Äôre still able to catch and spread the virus? I‚Äôm seeing other countries that have their populations vaccinated and they‚Äôre lifting precautions because they‚Äôre vaccinated. Yet here we are::: people getting vaccinated yet they still have to do everything they were already doing before?,Yes::: thank you MIT for keeping our youth and staff safe ‚ù£Ô∏èWe need to keep vigilant!

Or the mask üò∑ somehow stops the virus completely?,"""May be possible?"" The published science is pretty clear on this. 67% of vaccinated people do not spread the virus but 33% do.",Of COURSE it's possible. The question is: does the probability of spreading after being vaccinated without a mask reduce below the current probability of spreading with NO vaccine and wearing a mask? Have we moved the goalposts yet again? Is it so wrong to expect public policy orders to be based on some sort of metric? If you never elucidate a threshold::: you never have to acknowledge if it has been crossed or not.,No::: that‚Äôs not going to be the ‚ÄúNew Normal‚Äù. Once you are vaccinated and most people around you are vaccinated - you are done with the mask.,Vaccination is low level infection::: of course it make vaccinated people containing viruses,Because this mRNA vaccine only targets the spike protein and not the whole virus like conventional inactivated virus vaccines! Because mutants have this spike protein which has also mutated and therefore this type of experimental vaccine no longer works.

‚ÄúFermions are not Elementary particles‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúThe Standard Model is wrong because the Fermions are not Elementary particles‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat you learned from all Nobel Laureates::: from the greatest scientists::: from your professors::: from your books‚Ä¶about the Standard Model::: the Elementary particles::: the Fermions::: Matter::: Dark Matter is wrong‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúFermions are Bosons and Dark Matter particles. The Standard Model is wrong.‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

The Standard Model is a set of mathematical formulas and measurements describing elementary particles and their interactions.
The Standard Model has become recognized as a well-tested physics theory.
The theory incorporates only three out of the four fundamental forces.
The Standard Model leaves out Gravity::: Dark Matter and Dark Energy.

In particle physics::: an elementary particle or fundamental particle is a subatomic particle with no substructure; it is not composed of other particles.

Particles currently thought to be elementary include fermions and bosons.
Fundamental particles are either the building blocks of matter::: called fermions or the mediators of interactions::: called bosons.
Fermions are ‚Äòmatter particles‚Äô and ‚Äòantimatter particles‚Äô.
Bosons are ‚Äòforce particles‚Äô that mediate interactions among fermions.

I discovered the Ferent Equation for Elementary Particles
I explained that the Standard Model is wrong because the electron is not an elementary particle
I discovered that in the particle accelerator the electron becomes smaller and smaller::: because the frequency of the photon inside the electron becomes bigger and bigger
I explained electron ‚Äì positron collision
I discovered that high energy particles::: Z and W bosons are not created from electron-positr
on collisions::: they are created from photons collisions in Ferent Quantum Gravity
I discovered what the electron is::: a photon around Dark Matter electron
I discovered that the energy of the photon inside the electron is around 0.5 MeV; that is why in Compton scattering the energy of the incident photon is scattered by the electron
I discovered the Dark Matter electron
I discovered that Ferent Mechanism not the Higgs Mechanism gives Mass to particles
I explained because the light comes from the electron::: in particle colliders::: it is the proof that the electron contains a photon
I explained wave-particle duality: the electron contains a photon::: this means in some experiments the electron behave as a wave
I calculated the Photon speed inside the electron
I calculated the charge created by the photon with f = 10^20 Hz inside the electron Q = 1.6 √ó 10^(-19) C::: the electron charge
I discovered that the Spin of the electron is the Orbital angular momentum of the photon within the electron
I discovered that Einstein was wrong::: light is a wave in the photoelectric effect::: because the incoming photon interacts with the photon inside the electron

What is the electron in Ferent Quantum Gravity?

‚ÄúLight comes from the electron::: in particle colliders::: it is the proof that the electron contains a photon‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúThe electron is a photon around Dark Matter‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúThe Dark Matter electron is the Dark Matter inside the electron‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

This is another proof that the electron is not an elementary particle and the Standard Model is wrong.

‚ÄúThe Spin of the electron is the Orbital angular momentum of the photon within the electron‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúThe circumference of the electron is Œª / 2::: half of photon wavelength‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúThe electron has an electric field due to the photon inside the electron‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúI am the first who explained the wave-particle duality for the electron: the electron is a photon around Dark Matter.‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúIn the particle accelerator the electron becomes smaller and smaller because the frequency of the photon inside the electron becomes bigger and bigger‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúThe light comes from the photon inside the electron::: in particle colliders‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúAll the physicists::: the greatest scientists::: the Nobel Laureates‚Ä¶do Not understand particle collision‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúI am the first who explained the accelerated elementary particles: The elementary particles are not the same as when the acceleration began in particle accelerators‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúAt 50 GeV the electron is contracted to d / 100000::: close to the speed of light. The electron is not the same as when the acceleration began‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúHigh energy particles::: Z and W bosons are not created from electron-positr
on collisions::: they are created from photons collisions in Ferent Quantum Gravity‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúI explained particle collisions::: because I discovered what the electron is‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

The equation for an elementary particle made of 2 particles::: a Matter particle and a Dark Matter particle::: is the Ferent equation for elementary particle as a quantum system:

‚ÄúFerent equation for elementary particles:‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

This is a linear partial differential equation that describes the wave function of a quantum-mechani
cal system made of 2 particles::: a Matter particle and a Dark Matter particle.

‚ÄúFerent‚Äôs Dark Matter mass-energy equivalence equation: E = md √ó vp^2‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúThe electron energy is the sum of the photon energy and the Dark Matter electron energy‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúThe particle energy E::: is the sum of Matter energy and Dark Matter energy:
E = Em + Edm‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄùFerent‚Äôs mass‚Äìenergy equivalence equation: E=mc^2 + md √ó vp^2 ‚Äú
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúFerent mass‚Äìenergy equivalence principle is another proof for Ferent Quantum Gravity‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

From these equations and these discoveries:

‚ÄúThe electron (fermion) is a photon (boson) and a Dark Matter electron (Dark Matter). The Standard Model is wrong.‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

That is why:

‚ÄúFermions are not Elementary particles‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúThe Standard Model is wrong because the Fermions are not Elementary particles‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúMatter is made of Bosons and Dark Matter‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúWhat you learned from all Nobel Laureates::: from the greatest scientists::: from your professors::: from your books‚Ä¶about the Standard Model::: the Elementary particles::: the Fermions::: Matter::: Dark Matter is wrong‚Äù

"A Black computing pioneer takes his place in technology history. MIT‚Äôs Whirlwind was one of the earliest high-speed digital computers::: and a young man named Joseph Thompson was the first person trained as a Whirlwind operator at the MIT Digital Computer Laboratory.

David Brock of the Computer History Museum recently interviewed Thompson to learn more about his time with the project and his subsequent years in the computing industry: ‚ÄúThey at MIT were looking for bright::: young kids who were not going to college:::‚Äù said Thompson::: seen in this c. 1951 photo with colleague Jack Gilmore. ‚ÄúI was the first [operator] to see if it would work::: and I guess it worked well. ‚Ä¶ You had to learn the whole system::: and you‚Äôd get to the point where you understand what they‚Äôre doing.‚Äù Thompson spent four decades in the computing industry::: as a programmer and manager::: among other things. Now retired::: he lives in California.

List of Adrian Ferent's contribution to Science:

I explained that Einstein GTR is wrong because the Equivalence principle is wrong and I explained that Einstein gravitational waves do not exist

I discovered Ferent Quantum Gravity (FQG)

I explained that Einstein STR is wrong and Spacetime does not exist::: this means M-theory and LQG are wrong theories

I discovered Ferent Quantum STR

I discovered the Ferent Gravitational Force Function

I discovered the Dark Matter beyond the Planck Wall

I discovered the Dark Photon much faster than light

I discovered the Graviton much faster than light with negative momentum

I explained what Black Holes are::: Black Holes are Dark Matter

I discovered how Stars were formed around Dark Matter

I discovered the Ferent mass-energy equivalence Equation

I explained that Higgs boson is the most Unimportant and Useless boson

I discovered the Ferent Equation for Elementary Particles

I explained that the Standard Model is wrong because the electron is not an elementary particle

I discovered the ‚Äòparticles transformation‚Äô
inside the particle Accelerators and particle Colliders

I explained electron ‚Äì positron collision

I discovered what the electron is::: a photon around Dark Matter electron

I discovered the Dark Matter electron....bec
ause I discovered Ferent Quantum Gravity!

I discovered a new Evolotion theory::: Ferent Evolution Theory

I discovered Transdisciplina
rity equation: the Mind Equation::: the Aura equation::: the Consciousness equation

I discovered that God did not create the Universe::: because first time the Dark Matter Universe was created::: and then it was created the Matter Universe and after that was the Spiritual Universe created with God::: because:
a<h<s

I discovered the equation of the Universe with the Dark Matter Universe::: the Matter Universe and the Spiritual Universe

I discovered that Ferent Mechanism not the Higgs Mechanism gives Mass to particles

I calculated the Photon Speed inside the electron

I discovered that Einstein was wrong::: light is a wave in the photoelectric effect::: because the incoming photon interacts with the photon inside the electron

I discovered that all 3 Einstein's theories are wrong GTR::: STR::: Photoelectric effect and I replaced them with new theories in 800 pages

What are we going to do about it? Use democracy and capitalism to form coalitions for protest::: bargaining::: and change to balance the offset. And organizations like the ACLU::: NOW::: and PETA need to hire better speechwriters and a more effective and strategic advertising team to move an unknowing public to persuasion. Perhaps employing Hollywood scriptwriters would be a revolutionary idea. Is what they did to the Trump Twitter Account Right? Is anyone doing anything about it? Should we as a public knowing that other individuals are experiencing the same problem be afraid of this trend? Can a technocracy rise to power if unchecked and gone unchallenged?

What Happened to the Right to Assemble and Freedom of Speech
The latest news now is that the FBI is investigating if foreign terrorists caused the riots at the Capitol. Duh! That would be the first assumption::: Guys! So why did they arrest local area cops::: an Olympic gold medalist::: and ex military? This is really scary. Really baffling. The government does not know what it is doing. And in addition::: they are blaming Trump. But if you think about it::: the Capitol Hill Riots endangered the President's life::: Guys! Wake up call! Because actually::: the Congressional Police can turn on the President and so can the Secret Service::: FBI::: NSA::: on duty local area police::: and on duty military. Is that what happened at the Capitol riots. Because I think the President‚Äôs Security was jeopardizedAnd:::
when all of you are sitting on your asses happily making and reporting the disgusting and controversial news of the day ::: When the country is stuck in Tent City America::: 911 WTC::: an unemployment crisis::: and an economic meltdown. Not having a care in the world about any of that reporting the same meaningless news and neglecting important clues of information such as the capitol riots and its implications for the secured position of the Presidency! Never Forget the sacrifice of good people who intentioned for only good to happen in the world and sacrificed their life to protect our rights and the Constitution of our country-the brave men and women of our military and the brave men and women of local law enforcement.

They have been poisoning and practising their military prostitution on me since January 2O20 after they trafficked me to China from France. They killed my French permanent residency because 2020 was the year when I could start apply for French citizenship
I was almost assassinated near school in France. I was also raped::: poisoned and harassed by Chinese spies in France who target and profit on whatever I like or love. I also don't understand why what those Chinese spies have done have more drugging-harm on me now in China than in France.
I was trafficked to China when I could start becoming French citizen. I don't understand why I could not go back home. Why I can not escape from being deadly raped::: harassed::: harmed::: misled and poisoned EVERYDAY by ‰∏≠ÂõΩ?
For example::: today::: I was harassed more than four times and like everyday::: they put me in sound chamber to rape me 24/7 and try to inflict permanent injury to my brain.
I think their next move is to use drug to start to make it work.
I don't have any mental problem but they are trying everything they can do make that happen.
After being poisoned really and raped in sound chamber at another hotel for two weeks::: today I moved to another hotel but I was harassed twice by more than four Chinese police for more than an hour. They even tried to illegally arrest me and harass me in police station. I don't understand why they want me to report in police station and to report what?
After they are gone::: I realized that I have been raped (not only just sexually) by sound chamber wherever I could obtain a place to rest in China. They did not come to harass me because they want sound chamber to be removed but they were selling their fake kindness.
I was also harassed/raped by two Chinese bastards who work at Westin Bund Shanghai. The first guy kept moving his hands like torchring pussy::: then when I was about to seat down::: another Chinese bastard come out::: looked at me and was showing me that his hands were moving and touching in a sexually way for a very long time. It happened at Westin Bund Shanghai::: in the Westin Club at dinner time on January 21th::: 2021.
I need help because they have been trying to create different mental problems and other problems on me for a very long time.
For example::: I turned on the TV so I could listen to something normal and think about something normal. I was watching CNN and BBC so in English but different Chinese bastards kept whispering very bad::: sexual and dirty things and to try to sell their way of politics and different Chinese females who whispered in very toxic::: evil and very very very I don't know how to describe::: sugar-coated things. They were whispering in Chinese. They really are breeding mental problems on me. They have sterilised me::: harmed my reproductive rights more than four times just the last six months.
Later I ate and drank sth::: then I heard when the food was going down that a Chinese bastard said:"" Áªà‰∫éËøõÂéª‰∫Ü""
I am raped more than ten times today by different Chinese.
I need to go to ICC to punish the criminals!
I still have one question: why Chinese are so obsessed with using sex as a resort to get what they want ?

Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúLight is a wave in the photoelectric effect::: because the incoming photon interacts with the photon inside the electron‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúEinstein and all the scientists did not understand the electron that is why they considered light as a particle in the photoelectric effect‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúEinstein received his Nobel Prize::: for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect; but Einstein and all Nobel Laureates did not understand the photoelectric effect‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúAll Nobel Laureates::: all scientists::: your professors‚Ä¶did not understand this interaction between the incoming photon with the photon inside the electron::: in the photoelectric effect‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

Is light fundamentally a wave or a particle?

Ferent Quantum Gravity explains the Universe::: Gravity and Particle Physics.

Wave-particle duality is the most fundamental description of the nature of a quantum object.
Wave‚Äìparticle duality is the current mystery in modern physics.
The physicists admit wave-particle duality as the finest explanation for a broad range of observed phenomena.

Double-slit experiment
In 1807 Thomas Young asserted that light has the properties of a wave in an experiment called Young‚Äôs Interference Experiment::: showed that lights (waves) passing through two slits (double-slit) add together or cancel each other and then interference fringes appear. This phenomenon cannot be explained unless light is considered as a wave.

The electron is described by what is called a wavefunction.
The square of the wavefunction's amplitude at a point describes the probability of an electron being at that point.

What is the electron in Ferent Quantum Gravity?

‚ÄúLight comes from the electron::: in particle colliders::: it is the proof that the electron contains a photon‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúThe electron is a photon around Dark Matter‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúThe Dark Matter electron is the Dark Matter inside the electron‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

This is another proof that the electron is not an elementary particle and the Standard Model is wrong.

‚ÄúThe Spin of the electron is the Orbital angular momentum of the photon within the electron‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúThe circumference of the electron is Œª / 2::: half of photon wavelength‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúThe electron has an electric field due to the photon inside the electron‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúI am the first who explained the wave-particle duality for the electron: the electron is a photon around Dark Matter.‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

The photoelectric effect was first observed in 1887 by Heinrich Hertz.

Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize for ‚Äòhis discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect‚Äô.
He explained the photoelectric effect which had been unexplainable if one only considers light as a wave. He asserted that light is a particle containing energy corresponding to their wavelength.
The photoelectric effect led to significant steps in understanding the quantum nature of light and electrons and influenced the formation of the notion of wave‚Äìparticle duality.

‚ÄúI discovered what the electron is and I explained the wave-particle duality with Ferent Quantum Gravity.‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

Einstein and your professors did not understand how photons interact with the electrons::: because they did not understand Quantum mechanics.

‚ÄúEinstein received his Nobel Prize::: for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect; but Einstein and all Nobel Laureates did not understand the photoelectric effect‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúI am the first who explained the wave-particle duality for the electron: the electron is a photon around Dark Matter.‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

That is why the electron behaves as a wave.

Light as a Particle in the photoelectric effect from Einstein::: your professors::: Nobel Laureates‚Ä¶

Matter as wave: E = hf where f- wave property
p = h/ Œª where Œª - wave property

All the students at universities learn that the photon act as a particle in the photoelectric effect.

The conclusion from the Planck::: Einstein and Compton analyses was that light::: which was thought to be a wave::: could also behave like a particle at the quantum level.

‚ÄúEinstein and all the scientists did not understand the electron that is why they considered light as a particle in the photoelectric effect‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúEinstein was wrong::: light is a wave in the photoelectric effect‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúLight is a wave in the photoelectric effect::: because the incoming photon interacts with the photon inside the electron‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

Ferent Quantum Gravity answered to this question:
Is light fundamentally a wave or a particle?

‚ÄúIn Ferent Quantum Gravity light is only a wave; no wave-particle duality for light‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúWhat you learned from the greatest scientists::: from your professors::: from your books‚Ä¶about the wave-particle duality is wrong‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

In all my articles::: my posts::: my videos I present my discoveries::: I do not present::: I do not explain the discoveries of others.
In Ferent Quantum Gravity the electron contains a Photon::: my Discovery.

For all Nobel Laureates::: for the greatest scientists::: in your books‚Ä¶ the electron is an elementary particle that means they don't know::: they don't understand what the electron is.

‚ÄúAll Nobel Laureates::: all scientists::: your professors‚Ä¶did not understand this interaction between the incoming photon with the photon inside the electron::: in the photoelectric effect‚Äù

Once you have your booster shot your antibody cells are very active they won't slow down for a very long time I'm told,Education in this World's renowned Institute is a waste if they think like this.,The mutation is inevitable to happen !!!!,I believe the vaccines only last a year,50 million abortions per year worldwide::: should we end some of that to make the world population hit 8.5 billion in 10 years...?,So there is no point is getting vaccinated for the virus that mutates like Covid-19 or the Flu every year,"https://

Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúAll the physicists::: the greatest scientists::: the Nobel Laureates‚Ä¶did Not explain the wave-particle duality.‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

Wave‚Äìparticle duality is the concept in quantum mechanics that every particle can be described as either a particle or a wave::: depending upon the circumstances of the experiment.

Wave-particle duality is the possession by light and electrons of both wavelike and particle-like characteristics
.

Wave-particle duality refers to the fundamental property of matter where at one moment it appears like a wave and at another moment it acts like a particle.

The description of light as waves was well-known::: but the photoelectric effect introduced firm evidence of a particle nature as well.
The particle properties of electrons were well known when the DeBroglie hypothesis and the subsequent experiments by Davisson and Germer established the wave nature of the electron.

Albert Einstein wrote:
‚ÄòWe are faced with a new kind of difficulty. We have two contradictory pictures of reality; separately neither of them fully explains the phenomena of light::: but together they do.‚Äô

De Broglie had proposed a pilot wave construct to explain the observed wave-particle duality. Each particle has a well-defined position and momentum::: but is guided by a wave function derived from Schr√∂dinger's equation.

Double-slit experiment
In 1807 Thomas Young asserted that light has the properties of a wave in an experiment called Young‚Äôs Interference Experiment::: showed that lights (waves) passing through two slits (double-slit) add together or cancel each other and then interference fringes appear. This phenomenon cannot be explained unless light is considered as a wave.

The double-slit experiment with electrons. The pictures show the pattern you get on the second wall as more and more electrons are fired. The result is a stripy interference pattern. The spots where electrons hit::: build up to replicate the interference pattern from a wave.
Particles such as electrons combine characteristics
of particles and characteristics
of waves. That's the famous wave particle duality of quantum mechanics.

The photoelectric effect is a phenomenon where photons (light quanta) have the properties not only of a wave but also of a particle.

To explain what the wave-particle duality means is a key point of debate in quantum physics.
There are many interpretations
but they are all bound by the same set of wave equations and must explain the same experimental observations.
This ability to describe reality in the form of a wave function::: generally in the form of the Schrodinger equation is at the heart of quantum mechanics.

There is no consensus on the genuine meaning of wave-particle duality and the interpretation of quantum theory.
The wave-particle duality is a fundamental property of the nature. At the same time::: it is one of the greatest mysteries of modern physics.

Sometimes electrons behave as particles in beta radiation and sometimes as waves in electron diffraction::: in the double-slit experiment.

What is the electron in Ferent Quantum Gravity?

‚ÄúLight comes from the electron::: in particle colliders::: it is the proof that the electron contains a photon‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúThe electron is a photon around Dark Matter‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúThe Dark Matter electron is the Dark Matter inside the electron‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

This is another proof that the electron is not an elementary particle and the Standard Model is wrong.

‚ÄúThe Spin of the electron is the Orbital angular momentum of the photon within the electron‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúThe circumference of the electron is Œª / 2::: half of photon wavelength‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúThe electron has an electric field due to the photon inside the electron‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúI am the first who explained the wave-particle duality for the electron: the electron is a photon around Dark Matter.‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúThe wave-particle duality explained: the electron contains a photon::: this means the electron in some experiments behave as a wave.‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

Bohr‚Äôs solution was the principle of Complementarity
.
The Complementarity
Principle says that sometimes electrons have the properties of particles and sometimes the properties of waves::: but never both together.

This means:

‚ÄúBohr‚Äôs Complementarity
Principle is wrong because electrons have the properties of particles and sometimes the properties of waves together.‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúThe Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics is wrong because Bohr‚Äôs Complementarity
Principle is wrong.‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

Plagiarism: to write a book about Einstein Gravitation theory::: to explain Einstein GTR in your own words.
It's Einstein's discovery::: not yours.
That is why all physics books are Plagiarism::: because the author explains a physicist theory using his own words.

That is why I discovered a new Gravitation theory::: Ferent Quantum Gravity.

‚ÄúAll the physicists::: the greatest scientists::: the Nobel Laureates‚Ä¶did Not explain the wave-particle duality.‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

The equation for an elementary particle made of 2 particles::: a Matter particle and a Dark Matter particle::: is the Ferent equation for elementary particle as a quantum system:

‚ÄúFerent equation for elementary particles:‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

This is a linear partial differential equation that describes the wave function of a quantum-mechani
cal system made of 2 particles::: a Matter particle and a Dark Matter particle.

‚ÄúFerent equation for elementary particle::: made of 2 particles::: a Matter particle and a Dark Matter particle::: is the Unification between Matter and Dark Matter!‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúFor Einstein wave-particle duality was a new kind of difficulty::: but was not a difficulty and was explained with Ferent Quantum Gravity‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

Einstein was right saying: ‚ÄúYou know::: it would be sufficient to understand the electron‚Äù which is still true today.

‚ÄúI discovered what the electron is and I explained the wave-particle duality with Ferent Quantum Gravity.‚Äù

Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúHow Plagiarism begins:
Many students want to become great scientists::: but after memorizing many books::: after obtaining many diplomas::: the vast majority of them realize that they cannot discover anything‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

All scientists did not discover what happens to particles in particle accelerators.

How scientists do explain particle collision? They explain the same::: plagiarizing each other:

‚ÄúAll the physicists::: the greatest scientists::: the Nobel Laureates‚Ä¶do Not understand particle collision‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

Some examples:

‚ÄúWhen two protons graze each other::: their squished electromagnetic
fields intersect. These fields skip the classical ‚Äúamplify‚Äù etiquette that applies at low energies and instead follow the rules outlined by quantum electrodynamics
. Through these new laws::: the two fields can merge and become the ‚ÄúE‚Äù in E=mc¬≤.‚Äù

Another example:
‚ÄúIn particle physics::: the term ‚Äúcollide‚Äù can mean that two protons glide through each other::: and their fundamental components pass so close together that they can talk to each other. If their voices are loud enough and resonate in just the right way::: they can pluck deep hidden fields that will sing their own tune in response‚Äîby producing new particles.‚Äù

Another example:
‚ÄúWe're focusing on an electron and a positron interacting with one another at high energies.
One thing that can result from such an interaction is the production of a pair of W bosons. There's the conventional way you would think about this as a sequence of images ‚Äì the electron-positr
on pair getting closer and closer until::: ultimately::: something happens::: the electron-positr
on pair vanishes::: and the W bosons simply materialize‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause the electron is a photon around Dark Matter::: the electron receives and emits photons with the speed of light‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

At what velocity does an electron emits a photon? The answer is another proof for Ferent Quantum Gravity (FQG).

In modern physics a charged particle emits and absorbs energy::: but its mechanism was not discovered.

This means:
All the Nobel Laureates::: all the scientists::: your professors‚Ä¶were
not able to answer to this question:
At what velocity does an electron emits a photon?

The internet is like a ‚Äòcomedy book‚Äô with answers to these questions:

Feynman's answer to the question:

‚ÄúAn electron emits an ordinary photon in response to being struck by a reverse-time (""advanced"") photon that has traveled backward in time from some point in the future.‚Äù Some point in the future"" could range from femtoseconds (or less) away up to billions of years in the future. The real photon that is emitted in response to the recoil-inducing
::: backwards-in-ti
me photon travels along the classical time path as a normal or ""retarded"" photon (no I did not make that up)::: and eventually strikes the very same target that emitted the advanced photon sometime in the future.‚Äù

‚ÄúI do not use references because I discovered these theories‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

How I explained the light in particle colliders:

‚ÄúIn the particle accelerator the electron becomes smaller and smaller‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

Because:

‚ÄúIn the particle accelerator the electron becomes smaller and smaller because the frequency of the photon inside the electron becomes bigger and bigger‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

From where does the light come inside the particle collider?

‚ÄúThe light comes from the photon inside the electron::: in particle colliders‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause light comes from the electron::: in particle colliders::: it is the proof that the electron contains a photon‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

This is another proof that Ferent Quantum Gravity is right!

‚ÄúI explained Particle physics with Dark Matter from Ferent Quantum Gravity‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúThe electron is a photon around Dark Matter‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúThe Dark Matter electron is the Dark Matter inside the electron‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

This is another proof that the electron is not an elementary particle and the Standard Model is wrong.

What scientists did not understand?

‚ÄúHigh energy particles::: Z and W bosons are not created from electron-positr
on collisions::: they are created from photons collisions in Ferent Quantum Gravity‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúI am the first who explained the accelerated elementary particles: The elementary particles are not the same as when the acceleration began in particle accelerators‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

The equation for an elementary particle made of 2 particles::: a Matter particle and a Dark Matter particle::: is the Ferent equation for elementary particle as a quantum system:

‚ÄúFerent equation for elementary particles:‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúFerent equation for elementary particle::: made of 2 particles::: a Matter particle and a Dark Matter particle::: is the Unification between Matter and Dark Matter!‚Äù

‚ÄúThere is no plagiarism in Ferent Quantum Gravity‚Äù
Adrian Ferent

‚ÄúI use quotation in Ferent Quantum Gravity::: to protect my theory from plagiarism‚Äù

"""We did not see the best of America in the attack on the Capitol today.

We greatly appreciate your communication.,But we heard the voices of Georgia‚Äôs future - loud and clear,Shame on you::: Rief::: for dividing us further by your insincere remark disguised as compassion. Shame on you for not speaking for all Americans. Half of the country believes the election was stolen::: half of the country voted against what is about to be unleashed on us. Half of the country believes that we now have an illegitimate oligarchy entering the White House. Be a leader and transcend your disingenuous condescension.,We must teach more about democratic values,"Worldwide we are asking ourselves:
why there was such a weak barrier of a bunch of cops for a ""protest"" that had been organized for days before on the pro-Trump social media? For the BLM protest there was an army.",I feel when you were lying::: mess up will be appearing. One thing I still can not understand::: why they can not start an investigation::: use the evidence to prove the election is clear::: and play like a dictator::: use its power in the hand to force others to accept it::: even if it is clear::: then no one will believe that or mentally sick::: or it is really not clear. Why they are so fearful to investigate even they have two months before Jan 6. This is really unlogical.,"Yesterday::: we witnessed how chauvinist mentality and blind crowds fueled with rage can paralyse common sense and obstruct the state mechanism. I believe this incident will be considered as an inflection point to restore democratic stability. No room for ""after me::: the flood"" ideologies. Hope you will find a way to reconciliate and I wish all the best for the people of the US!",We DID see the best of America today. Police::: defending the rule of law::: defying mob rule.,I wish I could get a scholarship from the school::: find out and I wish I got a ticket to the school. Fighting . I will do it,The outgoing POTUS finally did something to unite the country.,The Marxist Coup d'√©tat is now in high gear. Secret ballot boxes hidden under tables are ok. No tabulation oversight is ok. Dead people voting is ok. No signature verification is ok. Underage voting is ok. This is orders of magnitude worse than the most corrupt Third World banana republic election I have ever seen!,republicans are a joke.,Why do you remove uncomfortable comments which don‚Äôt violat any rules of Facebook community::: law::: nor rules of courtesy and proper discussion. I thought university is place of freedom of speech .,You have no idea of what is happening!,Prayers for the USA,Congrats on your part in this Coup.,Was that the worst of America,Putin‚Äôs Army is here commenting.

"We‚Äôve reached a reflective time in an especially reflective year for the MIT community.

But what I do know is::: I'm staying proactive on the daily üòâ The people directly involved with cutting back the CDC need to be held accountable PERIOD! Let's say for a moment::: that there was an old apartment building. This apartment building hadn't had a fire in about 100 years::: and the owner thought his building was safe::: his occupants intelligent::: mindful::: and responsible::: a fire is most unlikely. So he decided that his building no longer required a working fire alarm system and could do without the costly inspections and maintenance's they required and had them removed. And a mere three months later there was an electrical short in a fuse box that over heated a wire and sparked a fire hidden within the walls. The fire grew and residents escaped::: but not all of the residents could make it out before the building was engulfed in flames and lives were lost. . Should the owner of this apartment building be held responsible for the lives lost? What would a suitable punishment be? Does this sound like something you've heard recently?",2020 was a disaster.

Another silver metal which I can't confirm or match. A perfect preserved piece of a slice with chrondicals. Amass with orange. Other space rock has orange but not like this.

That's just what's on the shelf. I could be wrong on that. Need a lab. But I'm 85% sure. I've sent the aerospace dept head an email. She hasn't responded.

Infiltrations

Currently this has also been a much requested work for RGS Private Investigator::: both for detection and prevention of thefts::: theft::: misuse::: sabotage::: favors::: corruption::: bribery::: fraud::: leakage of strategic and confidential information ...

Companies in the commercial::: industrial::: banking::: hospital::: civil construction::: airports::: services::: law offices and even federal::: state and municipal government agencies make use of the services of RGS Private Investigator::: specialized in Infiltrations and disguised work for investigation::: verification and preparation of flagrante delicto with or without prisons (counting with police assistance) of illicit acts committed by officials or directors of those companies.

In the RGS Private Investigator::: we have specific techniques for the work of infiltrations::: since the circumstances of each work are different. Our professionals to work disguised in a company to detect and prove a certain fact::: are prepared technically and psychologically
to take responsibility.

Initial procedure

Our Agent to be infiltrated will work directly with the suspicious persons or department. As we have said before::: each case must be analyzed together with the client to establish the best ""function"" that the Agent should perform in the company during the proceedings.

In average of the RGS Private Investigator::: we solve a case of this nature around 30 days::: but there are cases that can take even months. This depends very much on the physical size of the company and the number of employees it owns.

Usually the RGS Private Investigator charges according to their time and importance of the case. Most of the time the value the customer pays::: and less than the loss that she had previously had and which she now had left.

Even if the case is resolved before we receive all the contracted value. If the case is not resolved within 30 days and the client::: knowing the difficulties faced::: understand that the work is being done well and the reports convincing::: may proceed to renew the contract.

Sincerely

"The best atomic clocks::: running since the Big Bang::: would only be off by half a second today. Still::: they could be more precise. Physicists have designed a new kind of atomic clock sensitive enough to detect dark matter and gravitational waves.

NEWS.MIT.EDU
New type of atomic clock keeps time even more precisely",12/18/20 15:05,"Here silly me I made some childish mistakes... or not? We should examine it.

What is dark matter and dark energy?

Dark energy and dark matter are probabilistic phenomena of similar nature.
In relatively near regions dark energy and dark matter aren't locally detectable
.
Dark energy is ambiguity of the wave function when observed from afar::: it has to generate alternative microstates (the macrostate is a bigger local area::: and/or the universe):::

and dark matter is loss of microstates which cannot survive in some local macrostate (they cancel out).

It is like a mathematical mapping function (in mathematics) in witch if we have set X and set Y:::
two elements of the set X might correspond to a single element of the set Y (that phenomenon is dark matter)::: and other extra elements without correspondence (non-entangled)
can exist in set Y (that phenomenon is dark energy).

https://
en.wikipedia.org
/wiki/
Map_(mathematics
)

Is unitarity maintained in that overall process? No and yes. Unitarity is theoretically always kept::: but in a renormalization
manner of infinite matryoshka dolls. No human observer has access to the infinitely bigger matryoshka doll (which probabilistic contributes negligibly)::: and that huge hypergrouping exists way beyond our local Hubble volume.

Is Lagrangian mechanics correct? That question makes no sense and no it's not correct. It makes no sense because each coordinate point used in the function is interpreted to be in an area. We can reshape this formulas though in a manner which include probability.","‚ÄúEntanglement-e

This means Hawking radiation does not exist‚Äù Adrian Ferent  ‚ÄúVirtual particles do not exist in Ferent Quantum Gravity; virtual particles exist in Quantum Field theory and in Hawking radiation theory‚Äù Adrian Ferent  ‚ÄúThe 2017::: 2019::: 2020 Nobel Prize in Physics are frauds because like Hawking::: they did not understand Gravitation::: Dark Matter and Black Holes‚Äù Adrian Ferent  ‚ÄúHawking radiation does Not exist::: because Gravitons emitted by Black Holes have higher speed and higher energy than the photons in Hawking radiation‚Äù Adrian Ferent  ‚ÄúBlack Holes will not evaporate‚Äù Adrian Ferent  ‚ÄúDark Matter and Black Holes will collapse the Universe::: the Big Crunch to the Ferent Wall‚Äù Adrian Ferent  Hawking radiation does not exist! Hawking::: Penrose::: Einstein‚Ä¶did not understand Black Holes!  Hawking radiation is the thermal radiation predicted to be spontaneously emitted by Black holes. Hawking's discovery followed a visit to Moscow in 1973 where the Soviet scientists convinced him that rotating black holes have to create and emit particles. When Hawking did the calculation::: he found that even non-rotating black holes produce radiation.  Because of angular momentum conservation for a Black Hole::: the Black Hole spins very fast; the matter around the Black Holes spins at 84% of the speed of light.  ‚ÄúHawking radiation does not exist because in Ferent Quantum Gravity the Gravitons are Faster Than Light‚Äù Adrian Ferent  Ferent Equation for Photon ‚Äì Graviton::: after n interactions::: gravitational redshift:  Ferent Quantum Gravity is the most important theory!  The Hawking radiation temperature formula is the picture on Hawking‚Äôs grave:  Hawking radiation is blackbody radiation that is predicted to be released by Black holes::: due to quantum effects near the event horizon.  Temperature of a Black hole is inversely proportional to its mass::: such that: Hawking radiation temperature: T = k / M The power of the Hawking radiation from a solar mass Black hole turns out to be minuscule: 9 x 10^(-29) W. For a Black hole of one solar mass::: we get an evaporation time of 2√ó10^67 years::: much longer than the age of the Universe.  Hawking and all the scientists did not understand Gravitation and Black holes.  ‚ÄúBlack holes are Dark Matter‚Äù Adrian Ferent  ‚ÄúDark Matter does not have temperature‚Äù Adrian Ferent  ‚ÄúGravitons from Black holes transform Matter::: ‚Äòheat‚Äô in Dark Matter‚Äù Adrian Ferent  Hawking Radiation: black holes will generate virtual particles right at the edge of their event horizons.  ‚ÄúVirtual particles do not exist in Ferent Quantum Gravity; virtual particles exist in Quantum Field theory and in Hawking radiation theory‚Äù Adrian Ferent  ‚ÄúEvent horizons do not exist in Ferent Quantum Gravity::: event horizons exist in Einstein General Theory of Relativity. At Event horizons there are only Gravitons without Hawking radiation.‚Äù Adrian Ferent  I calculated: the graviton‚Äôs energy emitted by black holes is much higher than 1 GeV.  This is another proof that Hawking radiation does not exist:  ‚ÄúThe graviton‚Äôs energy emitted by Black Holes is much higher than photon‚Äôs energy in Hawking radiation. This means Hawking radiation does not exist‚Äù Adrian Ferent  ‚ÄúBecause Black Holes are Dark Matter::: Black Holes do not have temperature‚Äù Adrian Ferent  ‚ÄúGravitational force is mediated by gravitons faster than the speed of light::: with negative momentum‚Äù Adrian Ferent  ‚ÄúThe 2017::: 2019::: 2020 Nobel Prize in Physics are frauds because like Hawking::: they did not understand Gravitation::: Dark Matter and Black Holes‚Äù Adrian Ferent  ‚ÄúIf gravitons have only the speed of light will not be able to keep constellations together‚Äú Adrian Ferent  A graviton needs less then one second to travel between stars located within 10 light-years. A light year value is ly = 9.460536207√ó10^ 15 m::: the speed of the graviton va = 1.001762 √ó 10^17 m/s and t = 10 √ó ly / va ::: this means t < 1s.  ‚ÄúIf the gravitons would have only the speed of light::: how you learned from Einstein::: the greatest scientists::: the light::: the photons would escape from a Black hole and the Hawking radiation would exist‚Äù Adrian Ferent  ‚ÄùIn Ferent Quantum Gravity gravitons have a much higher speed than the speed of light and the photons from Hawking radiation cannot escape the Black Hole. This means Hawking radiation does not exist‚Äù Adrian Ferent  You learned from your professors that nothing can travel faster than light; I explained that the Gravitons are faster than light. This is another proof that Ferent Quantum Gravity is right and Einstein Gravitation theory is wrong. This is another proof that LIGO is a fraud::: because gravitational waves are faster than light.  ‚ÄúGravitational waves are carried by gravitons‚Äù Adrian Ferent  Conclusion:  ‚ÄúHawking radiation does Not exist::: because Gravitons emitted by Black Holes have higher speed and higher energy than the photons in Hawking radiation‚Äù Adrian Ferent  ‚ÄúBlack Holes will not evaporate‚Äù Adrian Ferent  ‚ÄúDark Matter and Black Holes will collapse the Universe::: the Big Crunch to the Ferent Wall‚Äù Adrian Ferent  https:// www.researchgate .net/ publication/ 346562151_Hawkin g_radiation_doe s_Not_exist_bec ause_Gravitons_ emitted_by_Blac k_Holes_have_hi gher_speed_and_ higher_energy_t han_the_photons _in_Hawking_rad iation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What amazes me is that no one has tried for 100 years to explain with Quantum mechanics time dilation::: length contraction::: Gravity. What amazes me even more is that they received in 2017 the Nobel Prize for detecting of Einstein‚Äôs gravitational waves::: which do not exist in Ferent Quantum Gravity‚Äù Adrian Ferent  ‚ÄúEinstein::: all Nobel Laureates::: the greatest scientists::: your professors‚Ä¶did not understand Special theory of relativity and General theory of relativity (Gravity)::: they did not find a Quantum interpretation like in Ferent Quantum Gravity‚Äù Adrian Ferent  Theory of relativity predicts a time dilatation in a gravitational field::: so that::: relative to someone outside of the field::: clocks (or atomic processes) go slowly. This retardation is a consequence of the curvature of space-time with which the theory identifies the gravitational field.  The Twin paradox: Is a thought experiment in Special relativity with twins::: one of whom makes a journey into space in a high-speed rocket and returns home to find that the twin who remained on Earth has aged more.  Einstein discovered special relativity in 1905 with Minkowski providing his graphical representation in 1908. The first diagram used a branch of the unit hyperbola t^2-x^2=1::: thus illustrating time dilation. The difference between Special Relativity and general relativity General Relativity is that in General Relativity you can use any metric which is a solution of the Einstein field equations::: not just the Minkowski metric.  How big are Time dilation effects?  Time dilation: ‚àÜt‚Ä≤ = Œ≥‚àÜt  The de Broglie wavelength for the relativistic mass-energy:  é = h/vŒ≥m0  At high speed the momentum ‚Äòp‚Äô of the object is high and the wavelength is very small.  Ferent ‚Äòmolecular‚Äô explanation of the Length contraction::: Time dilation:  The same thing for the molecules inside the object:  At high speed the momentum ‚Äòp‚Äô of the molecules is high and the wavelength is very small. At high speed the momentum ‚Äòp‚Äô of the molecule is high because the relativistic mass of the molecule is high and the speed of the molecule is high: p = vŒ≥m0 This means:  ‚ÄúAt high speed the mass of the molecules (all the particles mass inside the molecules)::: will increase::: they need more time to oscillate and this explains the Time dilation‚Äù Adrian Ferent  ‚ÄúAt high speed the mass of the molecules will increase::: they need longer time to oscillate and the atomic clocks and the mechanical clocks will tick slower‚Äù Adrian Ferent  ‚ÄúTime dilation or Freeze from the Inside when at high speed the smallest particles inside molecules::: inside the body have the de Broglie wavelength smaller and their mass bigger‚Äù Adrian Ferent  What means Freeze from Inside:  ‚ÄúFreeze from the Inside is from atoms::: to molecules::: to the body‚Äù Adrian Ferent  ‚ÄúIn Ferent Quantum Gravity Time dilation starts from inside::: from the smallest particles::: from atoms::: to molecules::: to the body‚Äù Adrian Ferent  I use body to explain the Twin paradox.  This is a Quantum explanation of Time dilation.  Colliders:  At CERN::: electrons and positrons were accelerated to energies of 100 GeV. For such particles::: v = 0.999 999 999 95c and Œ≥ is 200:::000. From the de Broglie relation we get a wavelength smaller than 2.4√ó10^(-15) m the electron diameter.  At CERN when they collide protons::: Œ≥ is 7000::: this means from the de Broglie relation we get a wavelength smaller than1.6√ó10^(-15 ) m the proton diameter.  ‚ÄúFrom Ferent Quantum Gravity::: Colliders are efficient because they collide Frozen particles::: where the de Broglie wavelength of the particles is smaller than their diameter‚Äù Adrian Ferent  The Twin paradox in Ferent Quantum Gravity:  Only the twin that accelerates to a speed close to the speed of light will feel the effects.  ‚ÄúAt high speed because for the molecules inside the body the wavelength are very small the body will contract::: cool down::: Freeze from the Inside and the Twin will die‚Äù Adrian Ferent  ‚ÄúAt high speed the mass of the atoms::: molecules will increase::: the mass of the internal organs will increase and the Twin will die‚Äù Adrian Ferent  ‚ÄúThe Twin will die because will Freeze from the Inside‚Äù Adrian Ferent  That is why:  ‚ÄúSpace travel at very high speeds close to the speed of light is impossible‚Äù Adrian Ferent  The Twin paradox!

Special relativity applies to all physical phenomena in the absence of gravity. General relativity explains the law of gravitation. Here is what you learned from Einstein::: the Nobel Laureates::: your professors::: your books‚Ä¶ about length contraction and the twin paradox:  Length contraction: a body moving relative to an observer will appear shorter in the direction the body‚Äôs traveling.  Einstein presented the following thought experiment for Length contraction: Let A'B' and A""B"" be the endpoints of two rods of the same proper length L0::: as measured on x' and x"" respectively. Let them move in opposite directions along the x* axis::: considered at rest::: at the same speed with respect to it. Endpoints A'A"" then meet at point A* and B'B"" meet at point B*. Einstein pointed out that length A*B* is shorter than A'B' or A""B""::: which can also be demonstrated by bringing one of the rods to rest with respect to that axis.  This means:  ‚ÄúEinstein did not explain the length contraction; he did not find a ‚Äòmolecular‚Äô explanation like in Ferent Quantum Gravity‚Äù Adrian Ferent  The Twin paradox: Is a thought experiment in Special relativity with twins::: one of whom makes a journey into space in a high-speed rocket and returns home to find that the twin who remained on Earth has aged more. It is considered a paradox because being that at constant velocity we are unable to discern which twin is non-traveling and which twin travels.  Einstein in his well-known paper on Special relativity in 1905::: he considered that when two clocks were brought together and synchronized and then one was moved away and brought back::: the clock which had undergone the traveling would be found to be lagging behind the clock which had stayed put. Einstein considered this to be a consequence of time dilation Special relativity::: not a paradox.  Length contraction in Ferent Quantum Gravity:  ‚ÄúThe interpretation of Length contraction you have learned from Einstein::: from your professors::: from your books::: from the greatest scientists‚Ä¶ is wrong‚Äù Adrian Ferent  ‚ÄúFerent equation for elementary particles:‚Äù Adrian Ferent  This is a linear partial differential equation that describes the wave function of a quantum-mechani cal system made of 2 particles::: a Matter particle and a Dark Matter particle.  ‚ÄúFerent equation for elementary particle::: made of 2 particles::: a Matter particle and a Dark Matter particle::: is the Unification between Matter and Dark Matter!‚Äù Adrian Ferent  A ‚Äòmolecular‚Äô explanation of the Length contraction is needed. Einstein did not give any explanation.  Length contraction: the length ‚àÜx‚Ä≤ of an object as measured in the frame in which it is moving::: is shorter than its length ‚àÜx in its own rest frame ‚àÜx‚Ä≤ = ‚àÜx / Œ≥  Relativistic mass: m = Œ≥m0  Relativistic momentum p = vŒ≥m0  The de Broglie wavelength:  é = h/p  The de Broglie wavelength for the relativistic mass-energy:  é = h/vŒ≥m0  At high speed the momentum ‚Äòp‚Äô of the object is high and the wavelength is very small.  Ferent ‚Äòmolecular‚Äô explanation of the Length contraction:  The same thing for the molecules inside the object:  At high speed the momentum ‚Äòp‚Äô of the molecules is high and the wavelength is very small. At high speed the momentum ‚Äòp‚Äô of the molecule is high because the relativistic mass of the molecule is high and the speed of the molecule is high: p = vŒ≥m0 This means:  ‚ÄúAt high speed for the molecules inside the object the wavelength is very small::: they need less space to oscillate and this explains the Length contraction of the object‚Äù Adrian Ferent  The Twin paradox in Ferent Quantum Gravity:  Only the twin that accelerates to a speed close to the speed of light will feel the effects.  ‚ÄúAt high speed because for the molecules inside the body the wavelength is very small the body will contract::: cool down and die‚Äù Adrian Ferent  ‚ÄúAt high speed the mass of the molecules will increase::: the mass of the internal organs will increase and the twin will die‚Äù Adrian Ferent  That is why:  ‚ÄúSpace travel at very high speeds close to the speed of light is impossible‚Äù Adrian Ferent  ‚ÄúWhat you learned from Einstein::: from your professors::: from your books::: from the greatest scientists‚Ä¶ about the Twin paradox is wrong‚Äù Adrian Ferent  Ferent Quantum Gravity:  ‚ÄúI quantized the gravitational field with gravitons‚Äù Adrian Ferent  ‚ÄúGravitational field is Gravitons‚Äù Adrian Ferent  ‚ÄúGravitational field is a discrete function‚Äù Adrian Ferent  ‚ÄúGravitational waves are carried by gravitons‚Äù Adrian Ferent  Ferent wave equation of the graviton:  Œ® ‚Äì the wave function of the graviton  General relativity generalizes special relativity providing a unified description of gravity as a geometric property of space and time.  ‚ÄúGravitation for Einstein is a Geometric theory; Gravitation for Ferent is a Quantum theory::: Ferent Quantum Gravity‚Äù Adrian Ferent  Conclusion: What you learned from Einstein::: from your professors::: from your books::: from the greatest scientists‚Ä¶ about Gravitation is wrong.  ‚ÄúEinstein did not explain the length contraction::: the twin paradox and discovered a geometrical interpretation of Gravity not a Quantum interpretation like in Ferent Quantum Gravity (FQG)‚Äù Adrian Ferent  Einstein did not explain the length contraction::: the twin paradox and did not discover a Quantum interpretation of Gravity like Ferent Quantum Gravity  https:// www.researchgate .net/ publication/ 346015283_Einste in_did_not_expl ain_the_length_ contraction_the _twin_paradox_a nd_did_not_disc over_a_Quantum_ interpretation_ of_Gravity_like _Ferent_Quantum _Gravity",Bhavik!!! üòçüòçüòç,Acts of terrorism::: treason and human rights violations in progress using advanced technology...I am being tortured::: need immediate involvement...d o whatever you can::: see my profile page for information.,11/18  https:// www.facebook.com / 157793094819088/ posts/ 662794204318972/  https:// www.facebook.com / 796338173770408/ posts/ 4556917281045793 /  https:// www.facebook.com / 119465751469140/ posts/ 3629289727153374 /  Taiwan...

His work has illuminated market behavior and gained a wide audience among scholars::: traders::: and policymakers interested in how markets can be structured.  NEWS.MIT.EDU A deep look at how financial markets are designed,2020-11-02 15:05:14,guardate quanto sono gonfiate le analisi sulla mortalit√† da covid19 di Riccardo Palleschi Attenzione ai falsi dati sulle morti Covid di alcuni siti web  Sar√† sicuramente successo anche a voi di farvi domande sul numero di morti e di confrontarli con altri Paesi. Esistono per questo alcuni siti web specializzati che in teoria dovrebbero darvi una mano ma che::: a volte::: possono nascondere delle falsit√†. E‚Äô il caso di Worldmeters::: che per quanto riguarda i dati sui deceduti della Svezia ha pubblicato una scemenza.  Ho voluto sottolineare questa cosa perch√© in molti::: dopo i miei video su Stoccolma::: hanno cominciato a scrivere ‚ÄúVai a vedere i morti che ci sono oggi (30/10/2020)‚Äù::: cos√¨ sono andato su worldmeters che dava un +9 rispetto al giorno precedente::: come potete vedere dall‚Äôimmagine:  Attenzione ai falsi dati sulle morti Covid di alcuni siti web 1  Peccato per√≤ che un‚Äôaltra fonte::: questa volta ufficiale come il sito dell‚ÄôOMS::: non riporti alcuna morte il 30 Ottobre::: come potete vedere dal grafico sottostante. Non si pu√≤ dire neppure che non √® aggiornato::: in quanto √® riportata anche sia la data dell‚Äôaggiorname to (sottolineata in rosso) sia il numero di morti che sono gli stessi di worldmeters.  Attenzione ai falsi dati sulle morti Covid di alcuni siti web  Il sito dell‚ÄôOMS::: inoltre::: non riporta alcuna morte neppure per il giorno successivo (il 31 ottobre).  Ora::: in un Paese di 10 milioni di abitanti::: cos√¨ poche morti non sono comunque indicative (neppure se fossero 9).  C‚Äô√® da aggiungere anche un altro aspetto al discorso decessi: l‚Äôagenzia europea MOMO che si occupa di controllare gli andamenti della mortalit√† in Europa non ha registrato alcun particolare incremento in quasi nessun Paese europeo. Guardate questo grafico:  Attenzione ai falsi dati sulle morti Covid di alcuni siti web 2  La linea tratteggiata in rosso rappresenta il limite in cui si raggiunge un aumento sostanziale della mortalit√†::: mentre la zona celeste √® la normalit√†. Tolto il picco di Marzo 2020 in cui quasi tutti gli Stati del mondo hanno visto aumentare la mortalit√† in modo marcato::: nelle settimane seguenti si √® normalizzato tutto. Se osservate con attenzione l‚Äôincremento della mortalit√† prima della fine di ogni anno l‚Äôaumento √® fisiologico ed √® quello che sta succedendo in Italia ora::: ed √® ancora nella normalit√†. Ma osservate la Svezia::: che in tanti dicono che sia un posto dove si muore come mosche::: la curva della mortalit√† √® perfettamente in linea con gli anni precedenti. La differenza FONDAMENTALE per√≤ qual‚Äô√®? E‚Äô che in SVEZIA non ci sono mai state misure di contenimento a differenza dell‚ÄôITALIA! Quindi questa √® la dimostrazione che vi stanno prendendo‚Ä¶ in giro.  Qui il sito dell‚ÄôOMS per confrontare i dati https:// covid19.who.int/ region/euro/ country/se.

They will see that our products are used in film and they will get used to them and will never know their true effect.  When they give birth::: we will inject poisons into the blood of their children and convince them that we are helping them!  We will start earlier::: when their minds are young::: we will target their children with what children love most::: sweet things.  When their teeth decay::: we will fill them with metals that will kill their minds and steal their future.  When their ability to learn has been affected::: we have created drugs that will make them sicker and cause them other illnesses::: for which we will create even more drugs.  We will make them docile and weak before us::: by our power.  They will grow depressed::: slow and obese::: and when they come to us for help::: we will give them more poison.  We will focus our attention on money and material goods so that they never connect with their inner self.  We will distract them with fornication::: external pleasures and video games::: so that they are never one with the unity of all.  Their minds will belong to us::: and they will do as we say.  If they refuse::: we will find ways to implement technology that alters the mind in their lives.  We will use fear as our weapon.  We will establish their governments and we will establish opposition within them.  We will own both sides.  We will always hide our goal::: but we will continue our plan.  They will do the work for us::: and we will prosper from their toil.  Our families will never mix with theirs.  Our blood must be pure (because it is).  We will make them kill each other when they oppose us.  We will keep them separate from unity through dogma and religion.  We will control all aspects of their lives and tell them what to think and how.  We will guide them kindly and let them believe that they are guiding themselves.  We will instigate animosity among them through our factions.  When a light shines among them::: we will extinguish it by mockery or death::: which suits us best.  We will make them tear their hearts apart and kill their own children.  We will accomplish this using hatred as our ally::: anger as our friend.  Hatred will completely blind them and they will never see that in their conflicts we will be their leaders.  They will be busy killing each other.  They will bathe in their own blood and kill their neighbors::: as long as we see that they are against us.  We will benefit greatly from this::: for they will not see us::: for they cannot see us.  We will continue to prosper from their wars and their deaths.  We will repeat this until our ultimate goal is achieved.  We will continue to make them live in fear and anger::: we will give them images and sounds.  We will use all the tools we have to achieve this.  The tools will be provided by their work.  We will make them hate themselves and their neighbors.  We will always hide the divine truth from them::: that we are all one.  That he must never know!  They must never know that color is an illusion::: they must always believe that they are not equal.  Drop by drop::: drop by drop we will advance our goal.  We will take over their lands::: resources and wealth to exercise control over them.  We will trick them into accepting laws that will steal the little freedom they have.  We will set up a money system that will shut them down forever::: keeping them and their children in debt.  When we ban them together::: we will accuse them of murder and present a different story to the world because we will own all the media.  We will use the media to control the flow of information and their feelings in our favor.  When they rise up against us::: we will crush them like insects::: because they are less than that.  They will be helpless to do anything about it. ...thats the modern medicine systems founder and you all profit from misery.",How do I get this for my son's school and my church now?

A cool class on Atomic sharings ( atomic language hidden in the words)  ****  percpective percueption but what all this means???  Percussive reactions::: in pective the sense is also a bit like pectin::: it gives a jus (juice) in eption the sense is hence::: from perception to percueption it takes hence::: since a percussive datation comes in source of fractal research of the heart Chakra::: this enhancement of the sense::: by particularity of the source of the chalice Complexitism Adverted ( brain in sacral positionment::: stance of Yogi::: is the anta letargic state of absolvance. This is a bit complicated. )  Now percpective is simply::: the percussive stance of perspective::: from the heart chakra::: or other chakras::: but it is linked with the sense of having a new solvent in rhythm.  Percueption is simply::: the percussive stance of::: of perception::: therefore the chakras follows the pulse of the core source of the event perceived through the chakras.  ****  Okay::: so let's get to the first class in details through this first modem on _Atomic sharings and Emotional solvance_  So let's go one by one::: little a little by.  when the sense is the first motor of the words in suggestive array::: so we can comprehend that the inner Galactic system of symbolism is therefore the source of our possible communication::: when humans in the past were creating languages the state of things (expressed matters) also came as the super promotor of percussive/ or malto narrative expression::: malto because the sense went first into the brain by ways of mediation::: but it rested there to subtly get transformed by the existanciality of the sharing. Therefore it become a malta::: malto::: the substance of a spiritual macerate also call in the different spans of its possibles::: a exomeriasm acid. ( remember the importancy of the substance acid here.) So::: the People created languages through the sense of their own experience of the incoming substanciality::: so it often ended in a multiple direction of the Outcoming sound of the words::: then later their orthography. Naturally::: we can say::: the brain was such that it read ::: Sun::: not only by the heat the light and the presence::: but the emotion::: and we should accept the fact that emotions are the link to the atomic lecture::: as simply as that::: since the way we cry is the same all over the planet::: and at the different period of the evolution of humans into what we are today::: as it is also for the animals ad plants and stones and other breu ( a deep matter of materiality.) and this is because the creator of this Universe is God::: and God is simple::: and sensible::: it came in this way that the most complexe matter happened to fragment in the heart of God as emotions. So those emotions::: were always the greatest teachers in fact in term of evolution of all type of life forms.  Meditate on that::: then we will go into the second dissection of the first class.  Modem number 2  _Conclusion of the modem::: in opening sciences of molecular enigma  the first class dissection  1.1*Culturally we think of languages as sub division of the sense of sharing particles of knowledge::: and we are right::: but we also know a parallel language sharing the emotional spans of communication known as Tonal or Pulsation (and a better name for it is Expremotional sounds.) Now::: when we align into what can transcend this world of emotions in the best and exactest way::: we shall comprehend that silence is needed to feel this particule of knowledge known as the emotion. *This ""Scanning"" of the sense we do is simply to have a new backing thoughts under acting in our pursuit of the knowledge of this class.  1.2 So the class was about the comprehension of the sense of words::: and also the ""capitule"" Complexitism Adverted. also expressed in the the fraction::: brain in sacral positionment::: stance of the Yogi: which is best summerized as the Anta letargic state of absolvance::: because it's true. Now let's explain all that with commune words and try to feel the sense.  Capitule: stands for a capital sense::: very important meaning::: and also it's molecular approach hence by this particle u ( the usage of u in science is often Potencial Energies::: so this sense exist::: but the reality of U is deeper::: in Termidor 7-Pi-Pi::: it is a receptacle of molecular datas.)  Complexitism Adverted: this sense is very simple in fact::: this is the conscious action of fragmenting complex matters with simple emotion  Anta: will be easily assimilated as the Charismatic sense of taking a counter activity in proaction of the activity::: in: Anti::: the counter activity is proclaimed::: but in anta::: this counter activity works for the activity::: an exemplar::: is the wind to the trees::: helping the tree to get strong by its anta action::: a teacher also sometimes do anta::: as such as parents::: this stance is a sign of intelligence::: so when the wise man observe the world::: he conclude God exist::: but to another extend the none existancialism of God exist also::: but the wise can conclude that this is an IS also::: therefore God is ""SHIVA""::: ""That Which is Not.""  Absolvance: super solvance.

Glen Shor named executive vice president and treasurer: The former vice president for finance will become MIT‚Äôs chief financial officer.  NEWS.MIT.EDU Glen Shor named executive vice president and treasurer,2020-10-17 15:05:03,That is fantansic,‚ÄúThe World War II was a war between factories. Today is a war between scientists‚Äù Adrian Ferent  The countries with more scientists will attract scientists and smart students in universities!,Wait for me MIT I'm coming,Congratulations,Redoxint project is patented and looking for development partner My prayer is to study carefully to understand the huge potential of the process I am looking for a financial or associate partner Here are some key phrases that describe the Redoxint project: 1. Completely ecological industrial platform without any gas emittion or other polluting materials. 2. Burning thousands of tonnes of household waste annually per furnace (without needing selection). 3. Alternative fuel production at competitive prices and in massive amounts. 4. Waste processing and industrial pollution neutralising of any kind (even burning gasses) 5. The re-launching and sustaining of the chemical industry on an ecological basis. Redoxint project introduces a series of novelties at conception::: which requires design and simulation::: in order to have a comprehensive view on technology Pollution appears when the technological progress reaches a level where it starts having a major impact upon the environment and the by-products management is not prioritised because of economic reasons. Massive gas emission with greenhouse effect are the result of a faulty attitude towards technology. In the same category one should include household and industrial waste management.  The level of pollution is so high that a change in attitude is needed towards the environment.  The Redoxint procedure is complex without being complicated::: combines existing technologies with innovation and it is in one word: The Future.  One of the most dangerous products for the environment are carbides. The release of carbon monoxide in the air is a big financial and energy related issue. The first patent that the Redoxing project is based upon describes a procedure and a processing equipment that processes carbides in a Tunnel Furnace.  The Tunnel Furnace used as an electrochemical reactor provides result gases at reasonable temperatures for them to be used as primary raw material for synthesis processing equipments (Fischer-Tropsc h::: Urea).  All these equipment can process huge amounts of gases that were released in the special temperature conditions specific to the Tunnel Furnace.  Carbide production happens at very high temperatures and the energy produced by the electrochemical reaction can be used for burning the household waste. The released gases of this burning procedure (at more than 1000¬∞C) will enter the synthesis processing equipment::: without any gas being released in the atmosphere.  The massive carbide production is justified by the use in the dehydration of ethyl alcohol obtained from the fermentation technology and cellulose producing technology. Both of them have alcohol in water as outcome.  The second patent included in the Redoxint project deals with the utilisation of the carbide obtained in eco-friendly conditions for the dehydration of ethyl alcohol. The dehydrated ethyl alcohol is the alternative energy source of the future when the cost is regulated by the Redoxint procedure. Also the massive quantities of acetylene obtained is an exceptional raw material in the synthesis chemical industry. Acetylene is the raw material used in the chemical industry that leads to the production of all the organic products::: from rubber to plastic materials and drugs::: dyes::: alternative fuel or synthetic fibres. I do not want to insist any further on the major importance of the acetylene::: the main point is that acetylene is the most important raw material for the organic and synthesis chemical industry.  At the end of the Redoxint production cycle::: there are two main products: Ca(OH)2 (slaked lime) and the ash produced by the waste burning::: both of them used as construction materials.  The Redoxint project is a perfectly eco-friendly industrial platform which gives the opportunity for other processing equipments to be attached to the existing platforms for processing by-products and for utilising the renewable energy of the Redoxint platform. There can be attached biodiesel processing equipments (which use alcohol)::: food industry and construction material equipments. The Tunnel Furnace can even process chemical industry gas by-products.  This kind of industrial platforms can be built anywhere in the world::: no exception. The platform‚Äôs dependency is only on the amount of green-house gases that need to be processed and house hold waste that needs to be burned. By combining more production centres::: the production can reach millions of tons of house-hold waste and just as much greenhouse gases that need to be processed each year.  In the case that the Redoxint technology has to be extended::: it is flexible enough to permit it. The amounts of dehydrated alcohol::: biodiesel and synthetic fuel from the Fischer-Tropsch equipment are comparable at price with the conventional energy sources. Also in the case of several platforms combined::: there is always the possibility of completely replacing the conventional energy sources.  The Redoxint technology is exceptional through simplicity and through the combination of already in use technologies with innovative one on one industrial platform. The capacity of becoming highly modular and the adaptability of Redoxint is sufficient to allow the reshape of the existing technological industry platforms.  Processing flue gases from the furnace tunnel in Solvay plant for seawater desalination offers the cheapest drinking water EXPENSES production are minimal::: considering that all reagents are byproducts of peripheral tunnel furnace installations Such production's expense are transferred acetylene's expense with the raw materials and energy for desalination are theoretically zero Redoxint process used for seawater desalination has the lowest production cost and quantity of drinking water most between the previous process Redoxint process offers solutions for two fundamental requirements in desalination::: low price::: and the maximum quantities of desalinated water If there is already functional Solvay plant::: construction furnace and peripheral installations are very easy to make  In the case of chemical industry::: one can imagine and adapt massive equipments for sea water desalinisation::: massive construction material production (like concrete)::: and all the platforms that can be described as eco-friendly and with a good waste management. In this way::: the Redoxint project makes neutralising and reusing of massive gas exhaust from a concrete plant for example::: possible.

I am Lalit Chudiwala from Delhi and I'm involved in a scientific research from the past 9 years and I've developed a concept for producing very high amount of energy at low cost on the principles of a free Radical Chain Reaction. Application : Produce energy for Thermal Power Stations.  Present Status Steps already taken: 1) Solved the Chemical Reaction 2) Reference papers to support this Reaction 3) Simulation Data 4) Developed the Prototype Design on Papers  Steps to be taken: Physical development of the Prototype  As we need new sources of cheap::: eco-friendly and sustainable energy::: this invention is the perfect solution for all.  To move forward::: I need funds/a team/ a Lab to develop the prototype. As a matter of fact I don't have any strong Educational /Scientific background. Although::: many scientists are already taking interest in my invention but this project needs very high level of scientific knowledge. I'm also seeking out for enough funds and space for the advancement of the project. This Reaction we also use for propulsion Expertise from US told me that this is a fusion reaction and you have use TABLE TOP FUSION RECTOR for expriment Looking forward for you to take ample interest in my project and help me fulfill my dream of helping the world with my invention as much as possible.Check my project at Research Gate by searching my name Lalit chudiwala or send me email id  Hoping for an early reply.

This is the most famous equation in the world::: the one defining the relation between mass and energy.  In 1704 Newton wrote in his book ‚ÄúOpticks‚Äù: ""Gross bodies and light are convertible into one another..."" With this words Newton created the mass-energy equivalence principle::: which urged later scientists to find mathematical solutions for his logical hypothesis.  In 1873 Nikolay Umov created an equation for mass energy transformation: E=kmc^2 where 0:::5 ‚â§ k ‚â§ 1  In 1900 H. Poincare and in 1903 Olinto de Pretto concluded too::: that the relation between energy and mass is E = mc^2.  In 1905 Albert Einstein did not formulate exactly the equation E=mc2 but he said: ‚Äôif a body gives off the energy L in the form of radiation::: its mass diminishes by L/c2‚Äô. Thus means for Einstein the inertial mass of an object changes if the object absorbs or emits energy.  ‚ÄúIn 2018 Adrian Ferent discovered mass‚Äìenergy equivalence for Dark Matter E = md √ó vp^2::: added it to E = mc^2 and Ferent‚Äôs mass‚Äìenergy equivalence equation: E= mc^2 + md √ó vp^2‚Äù Adrian Ferent  Adrian Ferent discovered that:  ‚ÄúIn Ferent Quantum Gravity the electrons::: the positrons::: Matter and Antimatter are made of Gamma rays and Dark Matter‚Äù Adrian Ferent  ‚ÄúBecause in Ferent Quantum Gravity the electrons are made of Gamma rays and Dark Matter::: is the first proofs for the mass‚Äìenergy equivalence equation: E = mc^2 ‚Äú Adrian Ferent  ‚ÄúBecause in Ferent Quantum Gravity the electrons are made of Gamma rays and Dark Matter::: is the first proofs for Ferent‚Äôs mass‚Äìenergy equivalence equation: E= mc^2 + md √ó vp^2 ‚Äú Adrian Ferent  ‚ÄúIn electron and positron collision Gamma rays are created because electrons and positrons are made of Gamma rays‚Äù Adrian Ferent  Einstein said; ‚ÄúYou know::: it would be sufficient to understand the electron‚Äù which is still true today.  ‚ÄúConclusion: No Conclusion.

Amount of dark Energy= Space volume√ó dark energy density = Infinite√óZero = ?  We need the function to calculating lim f(x) while limiting x to infinity!

G,"just because you are ""blind"" doesn't mean you have lost 100% vision::: some still have depth perception::: and other visual abilities",Universe diameter depends on bigbang mass and energy; less mass and more bigbang energy cause it expand more (more diameter)  So: D= f(m::: E)  Mass Energy equation (E= mc¬≤) is function of c::: So Universe diameter is function of c:  D= f(c)  Actually it is:  D= (œÄ¬≥+‚àö2)c¬≥ = 8.73√ó10¬≤‚Å∂ meters  I guess this formula is avoid to some Dark Energy behaviors.  Bigbang was from nothing (Dark Energy).  Dark Energy at each point of space is constant and big value.

I looked at them and closed the door and ran away::: he followed me saying his sorry and the woman is just a friend and nothing else but I knew he was lying and I walked away. I reached home and cried a lot until i told my best friend everything and she told me to fight for my man and not loose him to another woman. She gave me Mama Anna's contact(+277823 91426) and told me Mama Anna will bring back my boyfriend to me and love only me. So i contacted Mama Anna and told her everything::: she made a love and binding prayers for me and in 1 day of the prayers my boyfriend came to me with that woman I saw him with and knelt down and begged for my forgiveness and told the woman that am the love of his life and he doesn't ever want to see her again.

At least two ‚ÄúSnowball Earth‚Äù events occurred some 700 million years ago::: encasing much of our planet in snow and ice.

Please answer me my message,Hi! my name is alexandra::: I want to study at your university::: I am Peruvian and I am 18 years old::: I would like to know the cost and if there are scholarships?,It appears that if we ourselves become extinct or otherwise fail to colonize space::: it‚Äôs game over for life itself.  I‚Äôll explain:  As far as we can tell::: life eventually will become extinct on this planet whether we are here to witness it or not.  It is astronomically rare for a species of life to develop the capacity to entertain that apparently simple thought. In the entire history of life on Earth::: only one species of life appears ever to have evolved with the capacity to be aware of what to us appears to be a simple fact of geo-biological reality.  That species is us. We are unique.  Life is generally unaware of its fate. Should the human species become extinct::: should we choose::: for example::: to flush our rare gift of choice down the toilet of a self-induced climate oblivion::: and considering historical past performance::: it seems highly unlikely that life‚Äôs capacity to notice its otherwise unsupervised destiny will re-evolve before the clock runs out on life‚Äôs collective reproductive project.  If we ourselves become extinct or otherwise fail to colonize space::: then life itself as a single::: complex organism confined to this planet will fail to reproduce by pinching itself in half::: by forming two clones::: two curiously-named ‚Äúdaughter cells‚Äù which then wander off to have adventures of their own in time and space independently of each other::: until::: in the fullness of time::: they repeat the process::: and so on::: and so forth.  If life on Earth now declines to negotiate its collective mortality with reproduction::: it will expire in a single and apparently unique generation.  Like it or not::: we appear to have superpowers. Superman‚Äôs cape fits.  The destiny of life itself is in our hands. It‚Äôs our choice.

BioOptics World Editors Oct 1st::: 2015  An international team of researchers has developed a portable device for placing on the fingertip that counts white blood cells without a blood test. The technology‚Äîwhic h combines an optical sensor with algorithms‚Äîis designed for use on chemotherapy patients::: who could know their immune system levels in real time. It could also have utility in detecting serious infections.  The project::: known as Leuko::: has been financed by Madrid-MIT M+Visi√≥n::: a consortium that seeks to foster collaboration between research centers and hospitals in the region of Madrid with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT; Cambridge::: MA) and other centers in the Boston area. The Center of Future Technologies in Cancer Care and the Coulter Foundation are also supporting the project::: and the total amount raised has been close to $450:::000 (400:::000 euros).  Carlos Castro::: an engineer specializing in biomedicine who is working in the Research Laboratory of Electronics at MIT::: says that the new device will allow white blood cells to be measured simply and painlessly. ""Patients undergoing chemotherapy will be able to use a 'leukometer' in the future to estimate the state of their immune system:::"" he adds::: pointing out that the technology opens up the possibility to personalize chemotherapy treatment according to the immunological response for each patient. In the case of patients with lymphomas and leukemia::: treatment doses could be maximized for each individual without compromising their immunological system. Treatment efficiency could be improved while reducing the risk of suffering serious infections::: he says.  Researchers are working to miniaturize the device for white blood cell counting which could be used in a similar way to the pulse oximeter shown in the image::: used to measure oxygen levels in the blood. (Credit: Quinn Dombrowski) The technology includes a portable optical system::: which provides oblique illumination with LEDs and is able to capture images of superficial capillaries under the skin with cellular resolution. The acquired videos are subsequently analyzed by automatic algorithms capable of detecting white blood cells and calculating their concentration. These algorithms::: which have been protected by a patent filing::: were presented at the Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society::: held August 25-29::: 2015::: in Milan::: Italy.  Castro explains that the device is placed on the patient's fingertip in a similar way to how pulse oximeters are used in hospitals to measure blood oxygen levels. With a small lens::: the system captures images of capillaries very close to the surface in the nailbed. When illuminating at certain frequencies::: light is absorbed by the hemoglobin in the red cells::: an effect that does not happen with the white cells. This means that the leukocytes appear as small transparent particles moving inside the capillary. Subsequently::: the project's image processing algorithms recognize these events and count them::: providing an estimate for their concentration in the blood::: he adds.  The portable device will allow patients to carry out these measurements at home in the future::: so it will no longer be necessary for them to travel to a hospital or clinic. Castro says that other medical areas where the device could have use is preventing sepsis and early diagnosis of a bacterial or viral infection.  One prototype is a portable microscope which is placed manually on the patient‚Äôs fingertip to take videos of microcirculatio n in very superficial capillaries. (Credit: Research Laboratory of Electronics/ MIT) There are currently three different prototypes. One of them is a portable microscope that is placed manually on the patient's finger to take videos of their microcirculatio n in very superficial capillaries. This device has already been tested on 31 patients in Hospital Fuenlabrada in Madrid and on six more in Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. ""We are now working to improve its accuracy and reliability:::"" Castro says.  A second version of the prototype includes modifications to the microscope to improve the stability and quality of the images. The third one is a small optical piece that can be added to a mobile phone camera to obtain images of the circulation in the capillaries. ""These images could then be transmitted to a server where the algorithms would analyze them and give an estimate from the analysis:::"" according to Castro.  Castro thinks that by the beginning of 2017::: an initial beta product could be available for people willing to try it through crowdfunding platforms such as Indiegogo. With sufficient funding::: the research team could develop a final product that meets European regulations by the beginning of 2019.

In fact i have been 100% Drug Free for 13 of the last 18 years.,"Dr John M. Deutch/NOBEL PEOPLE Yes!!! I should win the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for being responsible for OVERTURNING/ DISMISSING upwards of 1 million cases in which a SYSTEMIC 8th Amendment Violation were present. In this case doing the ""math"" is not required. I have struggled with Drug Addiction (Cocaine) my entire adult life. I have done YEARS of Empirical Research. ;) I have snorted and smoked cocaine. I have never used needles. I was constantly aware of the Consequences for Behavior during my addiction. In the 1990's there was a Clear ERRONEOUS::: RACIST distinction between snorting and smoking cocaine. Sometime around 1994 while in Anchorage Alaska i tried to buy powder cocaine and the dealer sold me Rock Cocaine. I chopped it up and snorted it. When in the ""smoke-able"" form snorting the drug does not give you the immediate rush/high that is being sought. Obviously the drug is still in my system and i would still test positive for Cocaine::: however snorting smoke-able cocaine does not achieve the desired results. The next week i went back to the same place and the man sold me Rock Cocaine again. I asked him ""what am i supposed to do with this?"" The man got in the car and showed me how to smoke the drug/rocks. From that day on i PREFER to Smoke Cocaine rather than Snort Cocaine. However the substance is simply Cocaine. It is imperative the Nobel Chemistry Winners release a WHITE PAPER clearly identifying that Cocaine can be absorbed into the system byway of Smoking::: Injecting::: Swallowing::: Snorting and Jamming the Drug into an Orifice. Cocaine is Cocaine is Cocaine! This White Paper can then be used to Dismiss Millions of cases in the United States in which Minorities were sent to State Prison for smoking a Drug and White Men/Women were sent to County Jail for snorting/ injecting the Exact Same Drug.",Dr John M. Deutch/NOBEL PEOPLE the argument is simple: Nobel Prize winners in Chemistry will be given THREE Substances: One in Powder Form (Cocaine)::: one in Liquid Form (Cocaine) and one in Rock/ Smoke-able Form (Cocaine). The Nobel Prize Winners will be asked to take the substances to their labs and identify the Chemical compounds. I am confident all Nobel Winners will agree All Three substances are COCAINE!! I predict the Nobel Winners will become FURIOUS when they realize Racists Politicians in the United States Destroyed 100's of Thousands of Black Lives/Families in the 1990's for simply smoking the same drug another population https:// www.nobelprize.o rg/prizes/ lists/ all-nobel-prizes -in-chemistry/,Dr John M. Deutch Part #4) This is what you would be asked to Testify about in front of the United States Supreme Court: Is Powder Cocaine aka Snort-able Cocaine::: Liquid Cocaine aka Inject-able Cocaine and Rock Cocaine aka Crack Cocaine aka Smoke-able Cocaine all CHEMICALLY equivalent. Are the substances NO MATTER what form they are in simply referred to as COCAINE.,Dr John M. Deutch Part #3) FOUR MEN could make the argument in front of SCOTUS that the sentencing guidelines in the 1990's that sent a Population that consisted primarily of minorities to STATE PRISON for using the exact same drug another Population that consisted primarily of White Men/Women to County Jail was RACIST and Discriminatory akin to an 8th Amendment Violation: Charlie Sheen::: Samuel L Jackson::: Hunter Biden and Joe Melican could all turn Powder Cocaine into Rock Cocaine in front of SCOTUS in less that 10 minutes. In the 1990's the Possession of/Use of Powder Cocaine typically resulted in 30 days in County Jail. Possession of/Use of Rock Cocaine resulted in STATE PRISON for YEARS. The question WE would ask SCOTUS is WHY? We would be asking SCOTUS to justify the Sentencing Disparity. We would literally ask SCOTUS why if a man was caught smoking Cocaine he was sent to State Prison yet if a man was caught Snorting::: Injecting::: Swallowing and/or Jamming Cocaine up his backside he was sent to County Jail. I predict SCOTUS will be have NO LEGAL response::: thus an 8th Amendment Violation will be proven and EVERY CASE in the United States in which Sentencing guidelines differed in regards to how a person used the exact same drug will be dismissed. Upwards of 1 Million Convictions could be Dismissed. In this situation the COURTS have to justify their behavior. It is easily proven there is NO LEGAL justification for Sentencing Disparities based on how a person used the EXACT SAME DRUG! A Chemistry Major would be on hand to testify: Cocaine is Cocaine is Cocaine!,Dr John M. Deutch Part #2) In the 1990's if a Person chopped up a Vicodin Pill without a Prescription and snorted it they got sent to County Jail for 30 days. If they melted the Vicodin Pill down on a spoon and Injected it they got 30 days in County Jail. If they Swallowed the pill they got 30 days in County Jail. If they jammed the pill up their backside they got 30 days in County Jail. If they smoked the Pill on a piece of aluminum foil they got 30 days in County Jail. Then why in the 1990's if a person Snorted::: Injected::: Swallowed::: Jammed Cocaine up their backside they also got 30 days in Jail. HOWEVER if they Smoked Cocaine they got sent to State Prison for YEARS!! The answer is RACISM!! Racist POLITICIANS conjured up Sentencing Guidelines specifically to send a Population to STATE PRISON for Smoking a Drug rather than snorting::: injecting::: swallowing and/or jamming it up their backside. The Population the RACIST Politicians Targeted was predominately BLACK. All the cases involving Sentencing Guidelines that differentiated between how the person used the EXACT same Drug must be Dismissed. Obviously an 8th Amendment Violation aka Cruel and Unusual Punishment was present.,Dr John M. Deutch/ President L. Rafael Reif/ Chancellor Cynthia Barnhart these posts are directed at the CHEMISTRY DEPT and although at first glance my statements might seem peculiar. My statements/ observations prove SYSTEMIC RACISM existed in the 1990's. PART #1) Nobel Winner in Chemistry Robert Huber I HOPE and PRAY you read this as your input could result in well over 1 million Convictions in the United States being dismissed due to RACIST Sentencing Guidelines that targeted Minorities in the United States: Can an 8th Amendment Violation Argument be made in front of SCOTUS that Men and Women who Smoked Cocaine were treated UNFAIRLY akin to Cruel and Unusual Punishment compared to Men and Women who: Injected Cocaine::: Snorted Cocaine::: Swallowed Cocaine::: Jammed Cocaine up their Backsides etc. The summation of the argument is the next day all of the above would simply Test Positive for COCAINE!,Angelina Jolie help you now Heal the world/ We are the worldwww.unhcr.org,Angelina Jolie help you now Heal the world/ We are the worldwww.unhcr.org,such an important job,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thank you.,Subjective data....,UC's tuitions are still too expensive for most black Americans and all residents of California. I oppose ACA 5. Reject Chinese students to use tax payors money to get education in UC Systems. We should let black students::: white students and Asia Americans have more chances to study in UC. Now ugly Judges in the United States have caused too many homeless. Black people and Latin Americans can not afford to study in UC. We need to help more black people::: white people and Asia Americans to study in UC and kick out Chinese students and ask them to go back to China unless President Xi Jing Ping admits that Taiwan and China are two countries::: two Nations. China has ruined Hong Kong. It's President Xi Jing Ping's responsibilitie s to train Chinese students. It's not Trump's responsibilitie s to keep Chinese students in the United States. Unless President Xi Jing Ping admits Taiwan is not part of China. In War War II::: Hilter stated Zcheh was part of Germany. Let Asia Americans have more chances to get admission to study in UC and provide more scholarships and cheap dorm to help Black Americans and Latin Americans to afford to study in UC. No reasons to train Chinese Students from Communalism to threaten Taiwan::: India... These Chinese Students need to go back to China to get educations. Taiwan has never been part of China. Unless President Xi::: Jing Ping of China gives up to threaten Asia Countries. Otherwise all Chinese students from China should go back to China to get education. International students should not use taxpayors' money to rob the chance of black Americans::: Asia Americans and Latin Americans to get the chances of UC. International students should go back to China or study in Private Universities. They can not use US sources to try to threaten Asia Countries. Shame on You to use UC to train Chinese students to threaten Taiwan::: India::: Japan::: South Korea. China government should train Chinese students in China not in the United States when President Xi::: Jing Ping tries to use arms::: warships to across Taiwan Strait. Go back to China::: Chinese Students. Unless President Xi Jing Ping can give up intruding other Asia Countries otherwise UC should prohibit international students to use tax payors' money to train Chinese students. UC should let more Asia Americans::: white Americans and black Americans have more chances to study in UC. Tax payors pay taxes to support UC. So UC should stop to have international students to study in UC. Only graduate programs of UC can accept International students. So we can make sure there are enough Americans getting better education. We should help Black Americans can afford to study in UC and make sure UCLA and UC Berkley can compete with Yale and Harvard ..private Universities. It's stupid to use ACA5 to reduce 10:::000 Asia Americans to let black students or Latin Americans to get admissions. We should cut the numbers of International students or prohibit international students to study in UC to make sure California citizens can get better and cheap educations. o you want money. They train Chinese from China to threaten Taiwan etc and we need to send troops to protect those countries. Now there are so many black Americans::: Asia Americans or white Americans need to get admission to get better education. Now ACA 5 trys to cut 10:::000 Asia Americans to provide more chance for Black students or Latin Americans. Why don't we cut 10:::000 international students and help black students or Latin Americans to get cheaper price for dorms and tuitions. It's stupid to help China to train Chinese students to threaten all countries in the wholewide world. We should care about how to help black students::: Asian Americans::: white Americans to get good education. Why do we need to care about international students? In 1980 to 1990 no international students can get admission in US colleges. International students need to immigrate to the US then attended High School in the United States then they can apply US colleges. Now ACA 5 tried to cut 10:::000 Asia Americans to enter UC. We should cut the chance of International students to enter UC. UC should provide services to Americans not for international students. International students can enter Private University to get education or let China government to train these Chinese students. There is no reason to use taxpayor's money to help China government to educate Chinese students to threaten Taiwan and other Asia Countries. China keeps wanting intruding Taiwan::: India ..etc.,UC President should talk about whether defund the police of UC Santa Barbara. We will ask UC new president Dr Michael Drake to respond to Albert Yang case in UC Santa Barbara. Former UC stepped down due to Albert Yang's case. I will request UC current President to investigate Albert Yang at UC Santa Barbara. All proposals by Democratic Party are not good for Asia Americans. So Asia Americans should not support Democratic Party. If passing ACA5::: Asia Americans will be difficult to get admissions of UC. California Governors assigned bad judges to treat Asia Americans very bad. There are serious racial injustice in Court. Asia Americans will be used PC 1368 to deprive the rights of Jury trials. Cops treat Asia Americans worse than Black people. But nobody heard our voices. Democratic former Governor Jerry Brown assigned a bitch Evette Pennypacker to be judge of Hall of Justice at 190 West Hedding Street::: San Jose::: California. Bitch Evette Pennypacker is a criminal. Judge Evette Pennypacker has involved in falsifying Court Record on Nov 22::: 2019. There were two Court Papers::: one shows that Court was held and one was off Calendar. We need President Donald Trump to send people to investigate Hall of Justice in California. These corrupt Judges have made too many crimes in this Hall of Corruption in San Jose. Democratic Party does not know how to do good jobs in California. Governor Newson assigned DA Johnny Gogogo as Judge of Santa Clara County Superior Court. But DA Johnny Gogogo is a very bad DA and can not provide any compact Disk and evidences about my cases. These Judges have long terms encourage police to fabricate stories in Police reports. Asia Americans support Black Lives Matter::: white lives matters and yellow lives matter. Mayor of Fremont should listen to our voices to defund the police and defund the Judges and defund the District Attorneys. US Universities should not help President Xi Jing Ping to help Chinese students to get better educations unless China admits Taiwan and China are two nations. UC's tuitions are still too expensive for most black Americans and all residents of California. I oppose ACA 5. Reject Chinese students to use tax payors money to get education in UC Systems. We should let black students::: white students and Asia Americans have more chances to study in UC. Now ugly Judges in the United States have caused too many homeless. Black people and Latin Americans can not afford to study in UC. We need to help more black people::: white people and Asia Americans to study in UC and kick out Chinese students and ask them to go back to China unless President Xi Jing Ping admits that Taiwan and China are two countries::: two Nations. China has ruined Hong Kong. It's President Xi Jing Ping's responsibilitie s to train Chinese students. It's not Trump's responsibilitie s to keep Chinese students in the United States. Unless President Xi Jing Ping admits Taiwan is not part of China. In War War II::: Hilter stated Zcheh was part of Germany. Let Asia Americans have more chances to get admission to study in UC and provide more scholarships and cheap dorm to help Black Americans and Latin Americans to afford to study in UC. No reasons to train Chinese Students from Communalism to threaten Taiwan::: India... These Chinese Students need to go back to China to get educations. Taiwan has never been part of China. Unless President Xi::: Jing Ping of China gives up to threaten Asia Countries. Otherwise all Chinese students from China should go back to China to get education. International students should not use taxpayors' money to rob the chance of black Americans::: Asia Americans and Latin Americans to get the chances of UC. International students should go back to China or study in Private Universities. They can not use US sources to try to threaten Asia Countries. Shame on You to use UC to train Chinese students to threaten Taiwan::: India::: Japan::: South Korea. China government should train Chinese students in China not in the United States when President Xi::: Jing Ping tries to use arms::: warships to across Taiwan Strait. Go back to China::: Chinese Students. Unless President Xi Jing Ping can give up intruding other Asia Countries otherwise UC should prohibit international students to use tax payors' money to train Chinese students. UC should let more Asia Americans::: white Americans and black Americans have more chances to study in UC. Tax payors pay taxes to support UC. So UC should stop to have international students to study in UC. Only graduate programs of UC can accept International students. So we can make sure there are enough Americans getting better education. We should help Black Americans can afford to study in UC and make sure UCLA and UC Berkley can compete with Yale and Harvard ..private Universities. It's stupid to use ACA5 to reduce 10:::000 Asia Americans to let black students or Latin Americans to get admissions. We should cut the numbers of International students or prohibit international students to study in UC to make sure California citizens can get better and cheap educations. o you want money. They train Chinese from China to threaten Taiwan etc and we need to send troops to protect those countries. Now there are so many black Americans::: Asia Americans or white Americans need to get admission to get better education. Now ACA 5 trys to cut 10:::000 Asia Americans to provide more chance for Black students or Latin Americans. Why don't we cut 10:::000 international students and help black students or Latin Americans to get cheaper price for dorms and tuitions. It's stupid to help China to train Chinese students to threaten all countries in the wholewide world. We should care about how to help black students::: Asian Americans::: white Americans to get good education. Why do we need to care about international students? In 1980 to 1990 no international students can get admission in US colleges. International students need to immigrate to the US then attended High School in the United States then they can apply US colleges. Now ACA 5 tried to cut 10:::000 Asia Americans to enter UC. We should cut the chance of International students to enter UC. UC should provide services to Americans not for international students. International students can enter Private University to get education or let China government to train these Chinese students. There is no reason to use taxpayor's money to help China government to educate Chinese students to threaten Taiwan and other Asia Countries. China keeps wanting intruding Taiwan::: India ..etc.,Very interesting!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"‚ÄúI am delighted to join you in taking pleasure in the news that the federal government just rescinded the July 6th policy from Immigration and Customs Enforcement that would have prohibited many international students from studying in the United States if ‚Äì as was likely at many institutions::: in response to the pandemic ‚Äì their classes would be fully online.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI was especially moved by the involvement of our own students::: including those who contributed their personal stories to the legal effort and those who organized a national coalition of students in filing a brief. You show us what it means to be #OneMIT.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI am also immensely grateful to Harvard University President Larry Bacow ‚Äô72 for his leadership::: and to all the colleges and universities who signed court briefs in support of our suit.‚Äù  ""It‚Äôs deeply encouraging that this case has inspired so much reflection about and enthusiastic recognition of the vital role international students play in academic communities across the United States ‚Äì and absolutely at MIT."" ‚Äî President Rafael Reif  NEWS.MIT.EDU ICE rescinds rule on international students and online learning",2020-07-14 23:49:18,Pallavi Pareek :),Good Job,Amazing üëèüëèüëèüëç,Many thanks for MIT and Harvard ‚ù§Ô∏è,Thanks MIT for continuous support & care to our International Students. A great leadership has been shown.  #OneMIT,Thank you!,THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT FROM MICHIGAN!!,I am still waiting for my honorary doctoral degree from MIT for working at Digital Equipment Corporation as an OpenVMS Software specialist and then later as an OpenVMS Consultant.,INVEST IN AMERICAN SCHOOLS AND STUDENT !!!! MAGA !!!! THE INFILTRATION HAS CORRUPTED THE INSTITUTION !!!,Thanks MIT from Michigan üëç,From ‚ÄúTrump is right about foreign online students‚Äù https:// www.cognisity.ho w/2020/07/ GoTrump.html ‚ÄúLet the meaning of his words sink deep in your mind. Essentially he says that America cannot produce on her own enough innovative and creative professionals. That America cannot keep her competitive edge without snitching away the smartest and the most creative people from other countries. Other countries can::: but America can‚Äôt.‚Äù ‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúThis is an excellent proof of a trivial fact that American system of higher education is an element of American system of white supremacy::: white privilege::: and suppression of American minorities.‚Äù,M Sarmad Qureshi a ki a,Aj Castillo,Good job! Still sad that a win is stopping a very stupid change and getting things back to where they were.,Himanshu Ranjan,I‚Äôm glad that they changed the policy back::: but this sounds too much like bad cop/good cop tactics to me.,The power of a great culture!,https:// youtu.be/ IQPsKvG6WMI,Thanks for showing so much care for all our students! Our ‚Äò23 daughter üíï MIT!,From the President of Harvard University...  Dear Members of the Harvard Community:::  I am delighted to report that today the United States government withdrew the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) directive that::: among other things::: would have prevented international students from staying in the country if they attend institutions that are holding their courses online this fall. This withdrawal has nationwide effect.  This is a significant victory. The directive had disrupted all of American higher education. I have heard from countless international students who said that the July 6 directive had put them at serious risk. These student‚Äîour students‚Äîcan now rest easier and focus on their education::: which is all they ever wanted to do. While the government may attempt to issue a new directive::: our legal arguments remain strong and the Court has retained jurisdiction::: which would allow us to seek judicial relief immediately to protect our international students should the government again act unlawfully. This means we expect that the 2020‚Äì2021 academic year will proceed as we have carefully planned::: in our effort both to protect the health and safety of our students and others and to ensure that learning can go on in the best possible way under the current unprecedented circumstances.  We are immensely grateful for the widespread support that we and our students have received over the course of the past week. Hundreds of colleges and universities::: cities::: labor unions::: companies::: civic organizations::: and higher education associations filed amicus briefs in support of the complaint that we filed jointly with MIT. We also received support from Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey::: who joined 17 attorneys general from across the United States in filing a similar complaint.  This show of support is heartening. We all recognize the value that international students bring to our campuses::: to this nation::: and to the world. We recognize::: too::: that colleges and universities must pursue their educational missions while carefully protecting the health and safety of their students::: faculty::: and staff. At a time when this pandemic continues to rage::: we must continue to act with vigilance::: informed by the best available science and with a commitment both to carrying forward the vital enterprise of learning and to safeguarding public health. The ICE directive sought to force each of us to choose between the health of our communities and the education of our international students‚Äîa false and dangerous choice which we rejected. In the end::: the public overwhelmingly agreed with us::: and the government::: in response::: withdrew its order.  Higher education in the United States seeks and attracts the best and the brightest students from around the world. They strengthen our universities immeasurably::: and we aim to provide them with the best education possible‚Äîin a virtuous cycle that benefits all of us. Some will seek to stay in this country::: thanks to the freedoms and opportunities that they find here. And those who return home will do so enriched by the values we hold dear.  I am grateful to my colleagues across the University who have tirelessly fought to achieve today‚Äôs important result. Many worked literally through the night to ensure that justice prevailed. We owe all of them our thanks. I look forward to the day when we can welcome our entire community back to campus. In the meantime::: we remain dedicated to our academic mission::: and to enabling the best possible education for our students while affirming our deep commitment to the health of people in our own community and beyond.  Sincerely::: Larry  _______________ _____ Lawrence S. Bacow President Harvard University,Good job to the MIT Graduate Student Council - GSC for leading the way on the preparation of the student amicus brief in this case!

We will ask UC new president Dr Michael Drake to respond to Albert Yang case in UC Santa Barbara. Former UC stepped down due to Albert Yang's case. I will request UC current President to investigate Albert Yang at UC Santa Barbara. All proposals by Democratic Party are not good for Asia Americans. So Asia Americans should not support Democratic Party. If passing ACA5::: Asia Americans will be difficult to get admissions of UC. California Governors assigned bad judges to treat Asia Americans very bad. There are serious racial injustice in Court. Asia Americans will be used PC 1368 to deprive the rights of Jury trials. Cops treat Asia Americans worse than Black people. But nobody heard our voices. Democratic former Governor Jerry Brown assigned a bitch Evette Pennypacker to be judge of Hall of Justice at 190 West Hedding Street::: San Jose::: California. Bitch Evette Pennypacker is a criminal. Judge Evette Pennypacker has involved in falsifying Court Record on Nov 22::: 2019. There were two Court Papers::: one shows that Court was held and one was off Calendar. We need President Donald Trump to send people to investigate Hall of Justice in California. These corrupt Judges have made too many crimes in this Hall of Corruption in San Jose. Democratic Party does not know how to do good jobs in California. Governor Newson assigned DA Johnny Gogogo as Judge of Santa Clara County Superior Court. But DA Johnny Gogogo is a very bad DA and can not provide any compact Disk and evidences about my cases. These Judges have long terms encourage police to fabricate stories in Police reports.

NEWS.MIT.EDU Study finds path for addressing Alzheimer‚Äôs blood-brain barrier impairment,2020-07-14 14:05:08,Gates Foundation and Chan Zuckerberg initiates should respond to these issues submitted by former Samsung VP's Wife Charlene Lee. Mr. Bill Gates and his wife and Mr. Mark Zuckerberg and his wife should let us know whether support cops to rape women in jails. About Google CEO Sundar Pichai and his attorney Stephen Gicow stole Court Documents I filed on March 18::: 2016 and March 21::: 2016. Whether Mr. Bill Gates and Mr. Mark Zuckerberg support in Google CEO Sundar Pichai's stealing behaviors and bribing Court Judge Thedore Zayer? Whether Billionaire Bill Gate's wife and Mark Zuckerberger's wife support cops to rape Senti Becker in Main Jail in San Jose ? District Attorney Jeffrey Rosen of DA office of Santa Clara County and DA John Chase::: DA Jonny Gogo can not provide any evidence about Samsung VP's wife Charlene Lee's two Charges. I was assaulted at Taiwan Culture Center at 100 South Milpitas Blvd::: Milpitas::: CA95035. Joseph Chong Lin Ma::: Chief of Taipei Economical and Cultural Office was one of the person who arranged a woman to assault me in front of 300 persons. I did write to Mr. Bill Gates and his wife::: Mr. Mark Zukcerburg and His wife. Senti Becker was raped at main jail in San Jose. Mr. Bill Gates wife donated money to support women to become leaders in many high tech companies. Then about Senti Becker's being raped at Main Jail in San Jose by cops and about Samsung VP's Wife Charlene Lee's being jailed for one year by ugly Judges at Hall of Corruption in San Jose at 190 West Hedding Street::: San Jose::: CA95113. How are these wives of billionaires keep silent? Let UCLA and UC Berkley can compete with Yale University and Harvard University. I oppose to use race and sexes to select students of UC. We need to reduce the admission of International students. I oppose ACA 5 or Proposal 16. ACA5 will reduce 10:::000 Asia Americans to get admission to UC Systems. UC should not let China people to enter UC to study in the United States. We need to take care of Black people first not help China to train Chinese to study in UC. US has worst cops in the wholewide world. Ugly Judges have long terms on purpose jail innocent people. We should have one State Hospital to lock these Ugly Judges and have four of other State Hospitals to arrange these poor Homeless to live in the facilities of State Hospital. Nobody should live in the streets. US Judges have long terms encourage Police to fabricate evidences and fabricate stories in police reports. These Ugly Judges order Court Psychologists to lie in Court Evaluation Reports. US Judges and Police accuse everyone who pay salaries to them as mental illness. We need to lock these Ugly Judges::: Police::: DAs::: Public Defenders::: Lawyers and Court Psychologists. We can not have Nazi Government. US Judges have long terms on purpose jailed innocent Black people and Asia Americans. Judge Michele Macay Macoy and retired Judge Jerome Nadler etc jailed innocent Samsung VP's wife Charlene Lee for one year. District Attorney Johnny Gogo can not provide any compact disks or any evidence about Charlene Lee's Charges. Then Governor Newson on purpose assigned DA Johnny Gogo to be Judge of Santa Clara County Superior Court. We don't need ugly judges. Defund the Judges. Bloomberg stated he was willing to donate 18 million to Democratic Party. So these Governors have responsibilitie s to help in raising money from billionares to build some Homeless Camps and/or build Homeless Houses or Homeless City to take care of Homeless in streets across the United States due to some Judges' corruption. Defund all governors who assigned ugly judges to us and who can not resolve Homeless problems. Defund all mayors in the United States to put Homeless in the streets. Defund the Judges. Defund UC President and UCSB Chancellor Henry Yang and all Chancellor Members of UC Santa Barbara. Court Psychologist of Hall of Justice in San Jose California Robert Prez stated Samsung VP's wife Charlene Lee immigrated to USA in 1991 and I received Yale Bachelor in 1993. Judge Javier Acala and Judge Michele Macay Macoy have long terms conspired with Court Doctors to fabricate stories in Court Evaluation Reports and help these lying Court Psychologists to fraud Court Report Fee. We have written to many Presidents including South Korea::: Taiwan::: President Donald Trump and United Nation Human Right Office to accuse these US Judges pretend can not read English in Court and use Covid 19 to reject to have defendants to show up in Court. These corrupt judges::: DAs. Public Defenders::: cops and Jail Staffs have made a lot of Homeless across the United States. US governors assign many judges with serious mental illnesses to us. Judge Michele Macay Macoy has been sued by a woman for depriving her Civil Rights and violation of Undue proess but Judge Michele Macay Macoy and Judge Javier Acala insisted on using Court Psycologists Ashley Cohen::: Rami::: and Robert Prez Reports. These judges should be investigated and put into jails. How much do we need to pay for make Wolfe Road of Cupertino City to be clean and safe? Judge Evette Pennypacker assigned by former Governor Newson has involved in falisfing Court record of Nov 22::: 2019. Falisfying Court Record is a crime. City of Cupertino::: City Manager Debro Feng and Mayor Steve Scharff respond to this question. What is the reason to put a lot of homeless into Wolfe Street? Why did previous governor assigned Judge Javier Acala to us? Judge Javier Acala can not read English at all. District Attorney Johnny Gogo can not provide any evidence about jailing Samsung VP's wife for one year. Why did Governor Newson assigned the worst DA Johnny Gogo to be Judge Johnny Gogo? I did not see any homeless in City of Glendale and City of Burbank. I would like to ask Mayor of Cupertino Steve Scharff and Mayor of San Jose. Why do two mayors put so many homeless into street of Cupertino and Street of San Jose ? US Judges have long terms conspired with Court Psychologists::: District Attorneys::: Public Defenders::: Lawyers to cheat and fraud in Court. These Judges are most serious issues. We need to take our Judges' immunity. US Judges allege they can not read English and are unable to read any Court reports. These Judges are racists and need to be investigate and put them into jails. We need to recall more judges and defund the Judges. Many judges in the United States are incompetent and should be lock in jails or State Hospitals. Judges of Hall of Justice have long term have serious racial injustice. I will run for City Council of Cupertino on Nov 3rd::: 2020.

All we need is something good for humanity against Alzheimer and finally it is time...!,Eytan Suchard,It's stupid for Harvard and MIT to file law sues. We should have more black people to get education. Harvard::: MIT have no reason to reduce the chance of black students to get good educations but train Chinese students from China to against Taiwanese and Americans. It's reasonable to let International students to go back their countries. Bachelors' degrees should give to more black students not students from China. US government helps China to train Chinese students to threaten Taiwan and USA. It's stupid for UC trying to reduce the admission of 10:::000 Asia Americans. We need to let more black students to get permission to enter UC by cutting international students. We don't need to help China to train Chinese to threaten Taiwan and USA. Gates Foundation and Chan Zuckerberg initiates should respond to these issues submitted by former Samsung VP's Wife Charlene Lee. Mr. Bill Gates and his wife and Mr. Mark Zuckerberg and his wife should let us know whether support cops to rape women in jails. About Google CEO Sundar Pichai and his attorney Stephen Gicow stole Court Documents I filed on March 18::: 2016 and March 21::: 2016. Whether Mr. Bill Gates and Mr. Mark Zuckerberg support in Google CEO Sundar Pichai's stealing behaviors and bribing Court Judge Thedore Zayer? Whether Billionaire Bill Gate's wife and Mark Zuckerberger's wife support cops to rape Senti Becker in Main Jail in San Jose ? District Attorney Jeffrey Rosen of DA office of Santa Clara County and DA John Chase::: DA Jonny Gogo can not provide any evidence about Samsung VP's wife Charlene Lee's two Charges. I was assaulted at Taiwan Culture Center at 100 South Milpitas Blvd::: Milpitas::: CA95035. Joseph Chong Lin Ma::: Chief of Taipei Economical and Cultural Office was one of the person who arranged a woman to assault me in front of 300 persons. I did write to Mr. Bill Gates and his wife::: Mr. Mark Zukcerburg and His wife. Senti Becker was raped at main jail in San Jose. Mr. Bill Gates wife donated money to support women to become leaders in many high tech companies. Then about Senti Becker's being raped at Main Jail in San Jose by cops and about Samsung VP's Wife Charlene Lee's being jailed for one year by ugly Judges at Hall of Corruption in San Jose at 190 West Hedding Street::: San Jose::: CA95113. How are these wives of billionaires keep silent? Let UCLA and UC Berkley can compete with Yale University and Harvard University. I oppose to use race and sexes to select students of UC. We need to reduce the admission of International students. I oppose ACA 5 or Proposal 16. ACA5 will reduce 10:::000 Asia Americans to get admission to UC Systems. UC should not let China people to enter UC to study in the United States. We need to take care of Black people first not help China to train Chinese to study in UC. US has worst cops in the wholewide world. Ugly Judges have long terms on purpose jail innocent people. We should have one State Hospital to lock these Ugly Judges and have four of other State Hospitals to arrange these poor Homeless to live in the facilities of State Hospital. Nobody should live in the streets. US Judges have long terms encourage Police to fabricate evidences and fabricate stories in police reports. These Ugly Judges order Court Psychologists to lie in Court Evaluation Reports. US Judges and Police accuse everyone who pay salaries to them as mental illness. We need to lock these Ugly Judges::: Police::: DAs::: Public Defenders::: Lawyers and Court Psychologists. We can not have Nazi Government. US Judges have long terms on purpose jailed innocent Black people and Asia Americans. Judge Michele Macay Macoy and retired Judge Jerome Nadler etc jailed innocent Samsung VP's wife Charlene Lee for one year. District Attorney Johnny Gogo can not provide any compact disks or any evidence about Charlene Lee's Charges. Then Governor Newson on purpose assigned DA Johnny Gogo to be Judge of Santa Clara County Superior Court. We don't need ugly judges. Defund the Judges. Bloomberg stated he was willing to donate 18 million to Democratic Party. So these Governors have responsibilitie s to help in raising money from billionares to build some Homeless Camps and/or build Homeless Houses or Homeless City to take care of Homeless in streets across the United States due to some Judges' corruption. Defund all governors who assigned ugly judges to us and who can not resolve Homeless problems. Defund all mayors in the United States to put Homeless in the streets. Defund the Judges. Defund UC President and UCSB Chancellor Henry Yang and all Chancellor Members of UC Santa Barbara. Court Psychologist of Hall of Justice in San Jose California Robert Prez stated Samsung VP's wife Charlene Lee immigrated to USA in 1991 and I received Yale Bachelor in 1993. Judge Javier Acala and Judge Michele Macay Macoy have long terms conspired with Court Doctors to fabricate stories in Court Evaluation Reports and help these lying Court Psychologists to fraud Court Report Fee. We have written to many Presidents including South Korea::: Taiwan::: President Donald Trump and United Nation Human Right Office to accuse these US Judges pretend can not read English in Court and use Covid 19 to reject to have defendants to show up in Court. These corrupt judges::: DAs. Public Defenders::: cops and Jail Staffs have made a lot of Homeless across the United States. US governors assign many judges with serious mental illnesses to us. Judge Michele Macay Macoy has been sued by a woman for depriving her Civil Rights and violation of Undue proess but Judge Michele Macay Macoy and Judge Javier Acala insisted on using Court Psycologists Ashley Cohen::: Rami::: and Robert Prez Reports. These judges should be investigated and put into jails. How much do we need to pay for make Wolfe Road of Cupertino City to be clean and safe? Judge Evette Pennypacker assigned by former Governor Newson has involved in falisfing Court record of Nov 22::: 2019. Falisfying Court Record is a crime. City of Cupertino::: City Manager Debro Feng and Mayor Steve Scharff respond to this question. What is the reason to put a lot of homeless into Wolfe Street? Why did previous governor assigned Judge Javier Acala to us? Judge Javier Acala can not read English at all. District Attorney Johnny Gogo can not provide any evidence about jailing Samsung VP's wife for one year. Why did Governor Newson assigned the worst DA Johnny Gogo to be Judge Johnny Gogo? I did not see any homeless in City of Glendale and City of Burbank. I would like to ask Mayor of Cupertino Steve Scharff and Mayor of San Jose. Why do two mayors put so many homeless into street of Cupertino and Street of San Jose ? US Judges have long terms conspired with Court Psychologists::: District Attorneys::: Public Defenders::: Lawyers to cheat and fraud in Court. These Judges are most serious issues. We need to take our Judges' immunity. US Judges allege they can not read English and are unable to read any Court reports. These Judges are racists and need to be investigate and put them into jails. We need to recall more judges and defund the Judges. Many judges in the United States are incompetent and should be lock in jails or State Hospitals. Judges of Hall of Justice have long term have serious racial injustice. I will run for City Council of Cupertino on Nov 3rd::: 2020.

The barrier dilates ONLY when a person reaches REM sleep and then it functions as a means of flushing the brain of amyloid plaques (not mentioned in the article). I would focus on the astrocytic feet which have multiple functions in the maintenance and regulation of the blood brain barrier. And lets not forget the circumventricul ar organs as being a possible vector for viral brain infection because they lack a blood brain barrier due to needing access to the bloodstream... The jury is still out as to weather Alzheimer's is viral in its initial element of causation. Breakdown of the barrier does occur as a consequence of cerebrovascular diseases and traumatic brain injury::: with the former having a genetic causality. GREAT lab work coaxing human induced pluripotent stem cells to become the three types of cells that make up the BBB. And seeing a genetic link to APOE4 - and the 3D rendering of an APOE4-carrying engineered blood vessel shows heavy accumulation of amyloid protein...WOW.. . GREAT work by Joel Blanchard of The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory. We are all checking our 23&me results as we speak ü§®ü§®,UC's tuitions are still too expensive for most black Americans and all residents of California. I oppose ACA 5. Reject Chinese students to use tax payors money to get education in UC Systems. We should let black students::: white students and Asia Americans have more chances to study in UC. Now ugly Judges in the United States have caused too many homeless. Black people and Latin Americans can not afford to study in UC. We need to help more black people::: white people and Asia Americans to study in UC and kick out Chinese students and ask them to go back to China unless President Xi Jing Ping admits that Taiwan and China are two countries::: two Nations. China has ruined Hong Kong. It's President Xi Jing Ping's responsibilitie s to train Chinese students. It's not Trump's responsibilitie s to keep Chinese students in the United States. Unless President Xi Jing Ping admits Taiwan is not part of China. In War War II::: Hilter stated Zcheh was part of Germany. Let Asia Americans have more chances to get admission to study in UC and provide more scholarships and cheap dorm to help Black Americans and Latin Americans to afford to study in UC. No reasons to train Chinese Students from Communalism to threaten Taiwan::: India... These Chinese Students need to go back to China to get educations. Taiwan has never been part of China. Unless President Xi::: Jing Ping of China gives up to threaten Asia Countries. Otherwise all Chinese students from China should go back to China to get education. International students should not use taxpayors' money to rob the chance of black Americans::: Asia Americans and Latin Americans to get the chances of UC. International students should go back to China or study in Private Universities. They can not use US sources to try to threaten Asia Countries. Shame on You to use UC to train Chinese students to threaten Taiwan::: India::: Japan::: South Korea. China government should train Chinese students in China not in the United States when President Xi::: Jing Ping tries to use arms::: warships to across Taiwan Strait. Go back to China::: Chinese Students. Unless President Xi Jing Ping can give up intruding other Asia Countries otherwise UC should prohibit international students to use tax payors' money to train Chinese students. UC should let more Asia Americans::: white Americans and black Americans have more chances to study in UC. Tax payors pay taxes to support UC. So UC should stop to have international students to study in UC. Only graduate programs of UC can accept International students. So we can make sure there are enough Americans getting better education. We should help Black Americans can afford to study in UC and make sure UCLA and UC Berkley can compete with Yale and Harvard ..private Universities. It's stupid to use ACA5 to reduce 10:::000 Asia Americans to let black students or Latin Americans to get admissions. We should cut the numbers of International students or prohibit international students to study in UC to make sure California citizens can get better and cheap educations. o you want money. They train Chinese from China to threaten Taiwan etc and we need to send troops to protect those countries. Now there are so many black Americans::: Asia Americans or white Americans need to get admission to get better education. Now ACA 5 trys to cut 10:::000 Asia Americans to provide more chance for Black students or Latin Americans. Why don't we cut 10:::000 international students and help black students or Latin Americans to get cheaper price for dorms and tuitions. It's stupid to help China to train Chinese students to threaten all countries in the wholewide world. We should care about how to help black students::: Asian Americans::: white Americans to get good education. Why do we need to care about international students? In 1980 to 1990 no international students can get admission in US colleges. International students need to immigrate to the US then attended High School in the United States then they can apply US colleges. Now ACA 5 tried to cut 10:::000 Asia Americans to enter UC. We should cut the chance of International students to enter UC. UC should provide services to Americans not for international students. International students can enter Private University to get education or let China government to train these Chinese students.

And by now means and never infect an animal nor birds no matter what they lie to you surely they will not and would never bring the clear scientific proof::: also will not and would never afflict the seen mosquito at all::: in fact its hidden source is (Alba-oodah) the hidden tiny creature and it is the set parable in the creation by be and it is also it does not have a male that Allah created it from it nor has a female mother has laid it; in fact::: a tiny creature (ba-ooda) of challenge::: a new parable among the nations of tiny creatures. And it is (ba-oodah) tiny creature that Allah created with words of His power ‚ÄúBe‚Äù and it is. And it is not of the stingers nor the carriers of your disease from species of the known mosquito that you have::: holly Allah. In fact it is of the piercing penetrating (creature) that has an extraordinary exceeding speed that takes one of the humans who it invades him into his chest so it would take it as incubator for its eggs then it scatters its eggs with extraordinary speed scattering::: then it departs the body::: set off with extremely high speed leaving its eggs inside the chest of the human being::: so it would hatch through its nursery then viruses sprout from it and multiply in the body of a human being into (many) viruses::: and (center) its activity is in the chest. As for the factory of eggs for the lord obeying (ba-oodah) minute creature it leaves the body directly::: and only it makes the human being as a nursery for its eggs until it hatches then spread in the body (like) spreading of fire in the dry straw::: also center of multiplication of it is in the chest so it would infect by the tiny-seeds of its eggs from which it emerges::: as that the way of infections to other people from a human being to another human being::: through the open air; an air swimmers; so it would remain as living creatures in the air::: and it is not a mere world pandemic passing through::: willing he who pleased and rejects he who refused::: because the passing through pandemic is a cloud and it diminishes. Fare from::: very far::: I did not declare it to the humans as a mere world pandemic passing through; in fact I announced it (being) a world chastisement continuing night and day by Allah‚Äôs command::: the One::: the Subduer::: in various countries of the worlds with fluctuating levels from one person to another. For each are levels according to what they did::: some of it a warning and some of it an evil spread far and wide; in fact the new mother minute creature (Ba-oodah) is a worldwide calamity from the minor chastisement for you may humble yourselves to your Lord and beseech to Him repenting turning near to Him to have mercy for you so He would remove away from His chastisement::: so you would follow His Book the grand Quran. Then you obey Allah‚Äôs khalifa over the worlds::: His servant Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammad Al-Yemeni.  So do not be haughty above Allah‚Äôs khalifa then He would curse you a grievous curse as He cursed satan who got haughty above prostration to Adam; the human being ‚Äî first khalifa of Allah ‚Äî of mankind. So do not think the Imam Mahdi is dumb::: in fact smart and I am aware of I say::: I still insist that what you call it coronavirus is a living creature breaks-down and splits in the bodies of humans. There is no virus of its kind in the bodies of pigs::: donkeys::: cows::: camels nor in the entire cattle::: and the entire animals and birds are being disassociated from this world chastisement that continues night and day in various climates among the worlds.  I call Allah to witness and indeed Allah is a sufficient Witness that it is not as the causing illness viruses of which the human physicians know it ‚Äî who are specialized in science of viruses that can not live except in bodies::: in fact itself and its source the hidden (Ba-oodah) tiny creature you can not annihilate it with the entire insect eradicators; in fact it will remain alive whether in your bodies or in the air::: sea::: or land::: as well it lives in various climates regardless you are pleased or deny::: yet it is not forever; in fact::: it is continuing until you submit to Allah‚Äôs khalifa so you would follow Allah‚Äôs Book the grand Quran and disbelieve in what is contrary to Allah‚Äôs decisive Book the grand Quran::: I am a trustworthy advisor to you before (Allah) effaces faces then turns them on their backs or curse them as He cursed the Sabbath breakers a grievous cures when He pleases if did benefit you the chastisement admonition of (ba-oodah) the tiny creature that is originated from its minute-eggs::: thus it breaks-down and splits ‚Äî a chastisement to what is in the chests::: verily each is broken-down and split for you may believe::: and I give you an example about this: One grain out of which grow seven ears::: in every ear a hundred grains::: so look at this grain that you eat; it broke-down and split into hundreds of grains from one original grain::: this example only for you to know the intended of dividing and splitting and I do not say to you words of play and prose::: so keep your duty to Allah the One::: the Subduer.  -\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- -\-\-\-\-\-\ End of the quote full statement üá¨üáßüá¨üáßüá¨üáßüá¨üáßüá¨üáßüá¨üáß https:// www.mahdialumma. com/ showthread.php?p =332486#post332 486üá¨üáßüëáüá¨üáßüëáüá¨üáßüëáüá¨üáß  Imam Nasser Mohammad Al-Yemeni  17 - Dhul Qida - 1441 AH 08 - 07 - 2020 AD 09:17 am (According to the official time of [Mecca] mother of towns) _____________  ..Coronavirus::: yet it is not coronavirus::: in fact a foul-evil (rejz) that has associates::: a virus coalition,‚òïÔ∏è,https:// m.facebook.com/ story.php?story_ fbid=6910381383 41896&id=100023 071489574,Good Story,https:// youtu.be/ IQPsKvG6WMI,Juan Carlos,May your endeavours yield success injectability plays very important for immunotherapy.

"On Monday::: in a surprising development::: a division of Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced that it will not permit international students on F-1 visas to take a full online course load this fall while studying in the United States.  ""This ruling has potentially serious implications for MIT‚Äôs international students and those enrolled at institutions across the country."" ‚Äî President Reif  While we pursue legal protections for our international students::: we will continue to stay in close touch with them through email and updates on the International Students Office‚Äôs website http://mitsha.re/EPvi50AsUfX.

NEWS.MIT.EDU MIT and Harvard file suit against new ICE regulations",2020-07-08 15:45:01,Thank you MIT for fighting this arbitrary and self-defeating action by ICE. Proud to be an alum.,It's not a new regulation the student visa has always been tied to physical presence in school.,I guess I will now apply to MIT.,Reading the text of the suit made my day. üëç Glad to see this action.,Me parece lo m√°s correcto.,MIT makes me proud. It is why I give and volunteer.,Believers in the best that our students worldwide are and can continue to be!,make online learning optional!,I am a proud mother of an MIT grad. I respect so much what they are doing. These universities have the best brains in the world. Something that Trump and his followers won‚Äôt understand.,The Only reason you stand with them is because of the money the college makes from each international student,As an alumnus and Non-US citizen::: I‚Äôm proud of your position on this matter.,They got to be transparent. They have done the right thing by challenging it in the court. Why would MIT take the risk of being red marked?,Overwhelmingly proud to see MIT on the right side of history here.,I am proud of belonging to the MIT community,Thank You to MIT and Harvard for your quick action.No one has the right to play with a students life.,Proud of being an alumna today! Thank you for taking this action,You make me so proud MIT!,Both my alma maters are Doing the Right Thing. MIT almost always does - and Harvard is currently headed by an MIT alumnus.,Apparently::: MIT feels PROFIT (more tuition) is MORE IMPORTANT than the interests of AMERICAN CITIZENS.,Way to take a stand ‚ô•Ô∏è,They need to focus on education and training for americans,So proud to be a member of the great MIT community as an alumnus and recent graduate! You‚Äôre on the right side of history!,That is an amazing letter. Thank you::: President Reif.,Bravo de r√©sister √† cette honteuse d√©cision !,Thanks for standing up for what is right.,Reif and his quest to make MIT most liberal school in Boston,Sameer Ruhulx Minaj Biswajit Baishya Chao Ankur Chetia but in India all the gadhos are silent for removing some of the major chapters from social science.,So two multi million if not billion dollar schools losing roughly 30% income and pandering to make it look like they care for their students? Niiiccee smh,Good afternoon Harvard and MIT! Support American students and not international students. I support ICE.I see you're doing your part in maintaining your relationship with China. Harvard::: is this about the $1B you receive from China yearly? MIT::: what about your ties to Chinese AI companies that help the CCP enslave the Uyghur population? https:// mobile.reuters.c om/article/amp/ idUSKBN2491YF,Every foreign student has invested heavily for their education . If they are just sent back to their countries it would be very difficult for them to come back to USA. Many students have huge loans on their back and dreams in their eyes. America is always been land of opportunities . I don't know why trump has taken this stand he might have his own reasons but all I want to say is just think about everyone.,As an International Student In United States of America::: I Thank You For This Action.,Obviously they haven't heard about the pandemic and the massive amount of foreign students that are nothing more than spies from other countries.,Thank you MIT::: proud to be an alum.,That is why I love Harvard and MIT ....for their whole care to all students.....al l respect,Mit and Harvard are doing great job by taking this stand . No wonder why they are the top ones‚ò∫Ô∏èü§òüëç,The sad irony is that we wouldn‚Äôt be in this situation if Trump had taken the virus seriously long before he was forced to do so.,Congratulations to MIT on the complete capitulation by the Trump Administration::: rescinding their regulations before the Court could here the case. Kudos all around!,"Welcome to the new age of ""isolationism"" and xenophobia",As the CEO of Lime Connect::: a not for profit that works with students and professionals who happen to have disabilities - many of them from MIT and many on F-1 visas - I thank you for this action to support your students::: and all who are impacted. We are proud to partner with MIT (and Harvard::: who joins you) in our work.,I'm so sad to see a learning institution push a political agenda. How about investing in the US schools whom PROVIDE you with your freshmen class. Instead of the countless grants for exchange students. Such a sad day for MIT and Harvard - invest in USA - or other will !!!,why don't you just open a mandatory offline course to evade this decision?,They are actually going to lose this case rather easily. If any foreign national attends a U.S. school that offers all its students remote teaching then there remain no valid Visa necessary stipulations for one being issued them and also no need to grant them in person entry into this country. This is a no brainer 7-2 ruling coming up.,National security issue,MIT is an amazing institution. Time for the President to contemplate on the matter.......,Solidarity. Thank you MIT and Harvard!,Dear MIT::: I am an international student at another institution. I read about the lawsuit regarding international students‚Äô VISAS. However::: many of us can‚Äôt enter the USA anyway because of a travel ban currently in place on many countries of Europe and Brazil::: for example. Therefore::: it is with all my heart that I ask you to bring attention to this issue too. Bring attention to the fact that many students can‚Äôt enter the US. I‚Äôm currently suffering in anxiety since my flight is in one month and I still don‚Äôt know if I will be able to enter the US to attend my university which will be hybrids. Please talk about these travel bans as well.,Yep we stand with you M.I.T.,"Don't go full online. Keep a ""shell"" course in person. Something like ""Safety in the Workplace"" or whatever. Then tell students that no attendance will be taken and ""unofficially"" no one should actually come. That way the course load is not fully online and they won't be deported::: and in the same time no one actually will come and risk their lives.",Those people are lucky who can go to Harvard::: MIT.

Since classes are going online and there‚Äôs no need to step foot on campus then the foreign non immigrants can go home and study from there. That meets their forced social distancing rule too so this is a non issue,Campuses should be open like Cornell. No reason to close.  If::: however::: a university chooses to have classes 100% online::: then there isn‚Äôt a need to be in the US if home is elsewhere. Most students go home to study. No one is denying students the continued enrollment and education.,If you don‚Äôt actually have to be in the classroom you don‚Äôt actually have to be in the United States.,Trump administration drops plan to deport international students in online-only classes,It's stupid for Harvard and MIT to file law sues. We should have more black people to get education. Harvard::: MIT have no reason to reduce the chance of black students to get good educations but train Chinese students from China to against Taiwanese and Americans. It's reasonable to let International students to go back their countries. Bachelors' degrees should give to more black students not students from China. US government helps China to train Chinese students to threaten Taiwan and USA. It's stupid for UC trying to reduce the admission of 10:::000 Asia Americans. We need to let more black students to get permission to enter UC by cutting international students. We don't need to help China to train Chinese to threaten Taiwan and USA. Gates Foundation and Chan Zuckerberg initiates should respond to these issues submitted by former Samsung VP's Wife Charlene Lee. Mr. Bill Gates and his wife and Mr. Mark Zuckerberg and his wife should let us know whether support cops to rape women in jails. About Google CEO Sundar Pichai and his attorney Stephen Gicow stole Court Documents I filed on March 18::: 2016 and March 21::: 2016. Whether Mr. Bill Gates and Mr. Mark Zuckerberg support in Google CEO Sundar Pichai's stealing behaviors and bribing Court Judge Thedore Zayer? Whether Billionaire Bill Gate's wife and Mark Zuckerberger's wife support cops to rape Senti Becker in Main Jail in San Jose ? District Attorney Jeffrey Rosen of DA office of Santa Clara County and DA John Chase::: DA Jonny Gogo can not provide any evidence about Samsung VP's wife Charlene Lee's two Charges. I was assaulted at Taiwan Culture Center at 100 South Milpitas Blvd::: Milpitas::: CA95035. Joseph Chong Lin Ma::: Chief of Taipei Economical and Cultural Office was one of the person who arranged a woman to assault me in front of 300 persons. I did write to Mr. Bill Gates and his wife::: Mr. Mark Zukcerburg and His wife. Senti Becker was raped at main jail in San Jose. Mr. Bill Gates wife donated money to support women to become leaders in many high tech companies. Then about Senti Becker's being raped at Main Jail in San Jose by cops and about Samsung VP's Wife Charlene Lee's being jailed for one year by ugly Judges at Hall of Corruption in San Jose at 190 West Hedding Street::: San Jose::: CA95113. How are these wives of billionaires keep silent? Let UCLA and UC Berkley can compete with Yale University and Harvard University. I oppose to use race and sexes to select students of UC. We need to reduce the admission of International students. I oppose ACA 5 or Proposal 16. ACA5 will reduce 10:::000 Asia Americans to get admission to UC Systems. UC should not let China people to enter UC to study in the United States. We need to take care of Black people first not help China to train Chinese to study in UC. US has worst cops in the wholewide world. Ugly Judges have long terms on purpose jail innocent people. We should have one State Hospital to lock these Ugly Judges and have four of other State Hospitals to arrange these poor Homeless to live in the facilities of State Hospital. Nobody should live in the streets. US Judges have long terms encourage Police to fabricate evidences and fabricate stories in police reports. These Ugly Judges order Court Psychologists to lie in Court Evaluation Reports. US Judges and Police accuse everyone who pay salaries to them as mental illness. We need to lock these Ugly Judges::: Police::: DAs::: Public Defenders::: Lawyers and Court Psychologists. We can not have Nazi Government. US Judges have long terms on purpose jailed innocent Black people and Asia Americans. Judge Michele Macay Macoy and retired Judge Jerome Nadler etc jailed innocent Samsung VP's wife Charlene Lee for one year. District Attorney Johnny Gogo can not provide any compact disks or any evidence about Charlene Lee's Charges. Then Governor Newson on purpose assigned DA Johnny Gogo to be Judge of Santa Clara County Superior Court. We don't need ugly judges. Defund the Judges. Bloomberg stated he was willing to donate 18 million to Democratic Party. So these Governors have responsibilitie s to help in raising money from billionares to build some Homeless Camps and/or build Homeless Houses or Homeless City to take care of Homeless in streets across the United States due to some Judges' corruption. Defund all governors who assigned ugly judges to us and who can not resolve Homeless problems. Defund all mayors in the United States to put Homeless in the streets. Defund the Judges. Defund UC President and UCSB Chancellor Henry Yang and all Chancellor Members of UC Santa Barbara. Court Psychologist of Hall of Justice in San Jose California Robert Prez stated Samsung VP's wife Charlene Lee immigrated to USA in 1991 and I received Yale Bachelor in 1993. Judge Javier Acala and Judge Michele Macay Macoy have long terms conspired with Court Doctors to fabricate stories in Court Evaluation Reports and help these lying Court Psychologists to fraud Court Report Fee. We have written to many Presidents including South Korea::: Taiwan::: President Donald Trump and United Nation Human Right Office to accuse these US Judges pretend can not read English in Court and use Covid 19 to reject to have defendants to show up in Court. These corrupt judges::: DAs. Public Defenders::: cops and Jail Staffs have made a lot of Homeless across the United States. US governors assign many judges with serious mental illnesses to us. Judge Michele Macay Macoy has been sued by a woman for depriving her Civil Rights and violation of Undue proess but Judge Michele Macay Macoy and Judge Javier Acala insisted on using Court Psycologists Ashley Cohen::: Rami::: and Robert Prez Reports. These judges should be investigated and put into jails. How much do we need to pay for make Wolfe Road of Cupertino City to be clean and safe? Judge Evette Pennypacker assigned by former Governor Newson has involved in falisfing Court record of Nov 22::: 2019. Falisfying Court Record is a crime. City of Cupertino::: City Manager Debro Feng and Mayor Steve Scharff respond to this question. What is the reason to put a lot of homeless into Wolfe Street? Why did previous governor assigned Judge Javier Acala to us? Judge Javier Acala can not read English at all. District Attorney Johnny Gogo can not provide any evidence about jailing Samsung VP's wife for one year. Why did Governor Newson assigned the worst DA Johnny Gogo to be Judge Johnny Gogo? I did not see any homeless in City of Glendale and City of Burbank. I would like to ask Mayor of Cupertino Steve Scharff and Mayor of San Jose. Why do two mayors put so many homeless into street of Cupertino and Street of San Jose ? US Judges have long terms conspired with Court Psychologists::: District Attorneys::: Public Defenders::: Lawyers to cheat and fraud in Court. These Judges are most serious issues. We need to take our Judges' immunity. US Judges allege they can not read English and are unable to read any Court reports. These Judges are racists and need to be investigate and put them into jails. We need to recall more judges and defund the Judges. Many judges in the United States are incompetent and should be lock in jails or State Hospitals. Judges of Hall of Justice have long term have serious racial injustice. I will run for City Council of Cupertino on Nov 3rd::: 2020.

Letter to the MIT community regarding the Institute's initial decisions about the fall http://mitsha.re/EWxy50AbhyN  Tl;dr: Our community process did not produce perfect consensus. But we have now settled on the approach that drew the most positive feedback.  To allow students to stay on track to their degrees::: we will maintain the basic two-semester structure of our academic calendar. However::: we may need to start a week early (around Sept. 1)::: end any in-person instruction before Thanksgiving::: and finish the term remotely.  Our undergraduate residential population in the fall will be much less than our normal capacity ‚Äì conceivably as high as 60 percent::: but likely much lower. Exactly how many students can return at any point depends on several factors::: some beyond our control.  With this baseline two-semester decision in place::: we can now begin making the hundreds of subsequent interlocking decisions and arrangements required. We will share our detailed plans for the undergraduate experience no later than the week of July 6th.  Campus life will feel very different this fall.

The Kennard‚ÄìPauli‚ÄìW eyl uncertainty relation.  Measurement in quantum mechanics  In this case is to find simultaneously precise predictions for a measurement of position and for a measurement of momentum.  ‚ÄúThe Schr√∂dinger equation and the Dirac equation are wrong because length can not be smaller than Planck length and time can not be smaller than Planck time.‚Äù Adrian Ferent  So what is this smallest unit of energy? Planck hypothesized the existence of a constant::: now known as Planck‚Äôs constant::: or ‚Äòh‚Äô. The Planck constant ‚Äòh‚Äô is the amount of energy a photon carries with the frequency of its electromagnetic wave.  ‚ÄúThe Uncertainty principle is wrong::: because h/4œÄ does not exist::: because nothing is smaller than ‚Äòh‚Äô‚Äù Adrian Ferent  In this inequality h/4œÄ does not exist: ŒîxŒîp ‚â• h/4œÄ  ‚ÄúThe Kennard‚ÄìPauli‚ÄìW eyl uncertainty relation is wrong because h/4œÄ does not exist::: because nothing is smaller than ‚Äòh‚Äô‚Äù Adrian Ferent  You learned that the uncertainty principle is not about measurement.  ‚ÄúThe Uncertainty principle is about measurement::: the smallest length::: the smallest time‚Äù Adrian Ferent  Because I can measure 1 meter in Classical mechanics::: but I can not measure the Planck length in Quantum mechanics.  Measurement in quantum mechanics:  Any measurement in quantum mechanics can not be smaller than Planck time. Any measurement in quantum mechanics can not be smaller than Planck length.  ŒîxŒîp ‚â• h ŒîtŒîE ‚â• h  We have: Œîx ‚â• lp Œît ‚â• tp  Photon momentum: p = h /  é  What are Planck length and Planck time:  ‚ÄúPlanck length is the smallest wavelength of a wave function::: Œîx ‚â• lp ‚Äù Adrian Ferent In Quantum mechanics wavelength lp / 3 does not exist.  ‚ÄúPlanck time is the smallest period of a wave function::: Œît ‚â• tp ‚Äù Adrian Ferent  In Quantum mechanics time period tp / 3 does not exist. That is why:  In Quantum mechanics the energy::: the length and the time are quantized.  A Quantum fluctuation is the temporary appearance of energetic particles out of empty space::: as allowed by the Uncertainty principle.  Quantum fluctuation allows the creation of Virtual particles.  Virtual particles are brief Quantum fluctuations that have some of the characteristics of ordinary particles::: while having its existence limited by the Uncertainty principle.  ‚ÄúVirtual particles do not exist in Ferent Quantum Gravity; Virtual particles exist in Quantum Field theory::: in Feynman diagrams‚Ä¶‚Äù Adrian Ferent  You learned at university that Quantum fluctuations may have been necessary in the origin of the structure of the Universe: according to the model of expansive inflation.  Can a Universe appear next to you::: because of ŒîtŒîE ‚â• h in Quantum fluctuations? The answer is No because in ŒîtŒîE ‚â• h::: Œît can not be smaller than Planck time.  In the same way:  ‚ÄúThe Schr√∂dinger equation and the Dirac equation are wrong because length can not be smaller than Planck length and time can not be smaller than Planck time.‚Äù Adrian Ferent  The Vacuum energy is described as a Virtual energy potential of positive and negative energy.  Vacuum energy is a primary background energy that exists in space throughout the entire Universe. Vacuum energy can also be thought of in terms of Virtual particles.  ‚ÄúVacuum energy does not exist in Ferent Quantum Gravity‚Äù Adrian Ferent  Hawking mechanism for the evaporation of Black Holes: Another wrong theory related to Vacuum energy and Virtual particles is Stephen Hawking mechanism for the evaporation of Black Holes::: because the Event horizon and Virtual particles do not exist.  Dark Energy: Another wrong theory is the acceleration of the expansion Universe because vacuum ground state has non-zero energy::: the calculation implies a repulsive Gravitational field.  In Ferent Quantum Gravity:  ‚ÄúDark Energy is Gravitons‚Äù Adrian Ferent  Quantum mechanics is about small particles and is very well defined::: but scientists do not understand it.  What is beyond the Planck units?  ‚ÄúBeyond Planck units are Ferent units‚Äù Adrian Ferent  ‚ÄúBeyond Matter is Dark Matter‚Äù Adrian Ferent  You learned wrong things that Dark Matter is made up of sub-atomic particles::: Cold dark matter::: Warm dark matter::: Hot dark matter‚Ä¶  ‚ÄúThe scientists try to detect Dark Matter as Matter::: because they do not understand Dark Matter::: they do not understand what is beyond the Planck Wall.‚Äù Adrian Ferent  Because all Nobel Laureates::: all scientists::: your professors‚Ä¶did not understand Gravitation they did not understand Quantum mechanics.  This is another proof that Ferent Quantum Gravity (FQG) based on Gravitons is right and all other Quantum theories are wrong!  That is why:  ‚ÄúHeisenberg Uncertainty principle is wrong.

I think it'd be great if MIT would describe what they do to ensure equitable policing: Does campus PD use best practices with regards to de-escalation? Do they have body cameras? What external evaluations of campus PD do we have? What do they say?  I'm not an expert and somebody else should be asking better questions::: but I think it'd be great to see somebody do this.,I wish to study at MIT one day,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I.E gang wars::: and other crime related deaths.  only difference is that no other group in the USA is retarded enough to burn down their own cities whenever someone other than their own kind unrightfully kills them.  maybe if those very same communities were not hell bent on a strickt ""no sniching"" policy things would be different. but by all accounts blacks just love getting murdered by their own neighbors apparently.  what that policeman did was wrong. but making a big deal out of it is not only pointless. but also destructive::: as it drives a nerrative that is factually incorrect.  its a shame that the page of one of Americas greatest universities is incapable of research on such subjects. a true shame. theres a lot of people that sure could have been helped tremendously if universities did their job and actually identified problems rather than do their bestest in lying about them.  or at the very least not harbor the Antifa members that are directly responsible for the destruction being caused....",This means a lot to me.

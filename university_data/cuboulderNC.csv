"More than 700 employees and more than 600 students live in areas that were evacuated due to the recent fires in Boulder County. In all::: nearly 1:::000 structures were lost::: including the homes of dozens of CU Boulder students::: faculty and staff::: and reports of other damages are expected to rise.  Campus leaders made the difficult decision to begin the spring semester with fully remote instruction considering the fact that so many staff and faculty members are facing challenges such as managing illness::: securing housing::: working with insurance companies::: helping others in the community::: and replacing destroyed personal belongings from laptop computers to cars.  ""Starting the semester in remote status::: rather than a two-week delay::: preserves spring break::: which students have indicated is integral to mental health:::"" said Executive Vice Provost Ann Schmiesing. ""Not delaying the start of the semester also preserves Maymester::: which cannot overlap with the spring semester due to federal financial aid guidelines. Maymester is an important opportunity for many students to take courses necessary for their progress toward their degrees.""

Have you ever had::: or been involved in::: an abortion?  Will you be guilty on Judgment Day? If you have done these things::: God sees you as a lying::: thieving::: fornicating::: blasphemer::: adulterer at heart::: and murderer::: and the Bible warns that God will punish you in a terrible place called the lake of fire: Revelation 21:8::: AV: ""But the fearful::: and unbelieving::: and the abominable::: and murderers::: and whoremongers::: and sorcerers::: and idolaters::: and all liars::: shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.""  Yet God::: who is ""...rich in mercy:::..."" sent His Son the Lord Jesus Christ to suffer and die on the cross for all guilty sinners. We broke God's law and the Lord Jesus Christ paid our fine. That means God can legally dismiss our case and He can commute our death sentence.

One was a specific refrigerator a salesperson was telling me about::: when I had no interest. Then 2 hours later I got an ad for that specific one on my work computer. I have had ads pop up for stuff I have only talked about in a verbal conversation. I don't want or need ads to be fair I just need them to go away. They should not be listening in to my conversations::: especially ones that are verbal when my phone is in my pocket.,Cuz they are listening. It pisses me off everytime.

From the Chancellor: Welcome back Buffs I'm delighted to welcome you to our inspiring campus for the start of a new academic year. Much has changed since last semester::: and we're excited for the opportunity to live::: learn and work more fully together.,2021-08-23 15:14:46,Please please please amp up in person classes! All kids vaxxed; they never burdened the local hospital::: yet they paid such a high price last year with all online classes and told to stay home for 3 weeks in the fall‚Ä¶ please please please make this worth it!,I support all the other comments here (and there are even more on the parents page!) to get our kids back into in-person classes. My son::: who should have been a junior this semester::: has only 1 in-person class. Last fall::: all online::: was a disaster for him so he withdrew for Spring semester. He only registered for fall with the hopes of a majority of in-person classes only to find out after the full-refund withdrawal date that would not be the case. With the vaccine and mask mandates::: which I wholeheartedly support::: there is no reason to NOT have all in-person classes. Please work toward getting these kids back in class. Thank you!,I agree with everyone pushing for in- person classes. My junior was SO excited to get back to class this year::: only to find out that all of his classes went online.. this is disappointing and frustrating. I second the points made previously. Vaccinations and masks are more than enough::: but now a sudden change to many remote? My son created his schedule based on classes advertised as in person. Now none of them are. IN PERSON TUITION = IN PERSON CLASSES,Need to keep in-person classes since req'd everyone to get vaxxed. Otherwise::: why the mandate? And profs shouldn't get to just switch it. 1 said when I asked why lecture was remote::: said it was advertised that way so had to stick to it. Well::: bet good money students wanted in-person & only signed up for the advertised remote class as it was their only option::: not their choice of modality.,In person classes for all freshman::: please!,Agree all classes need to be back in person or change tuition rates for online kids are vaccinated as requested!,Hey CU::: have you thought of running some big and targeted blood drives and doing some good while finding out where the student body stands on antibodies? So many ways a University could use this information.,Agree with the comments here. We have the vaccination rates among both staff and students to support amping up in person classes.

The ‚Äúdelta‚Äù coronavirus variant now accounts for nearly 90% of the COVID-19 cases in the state::: according to recent data from the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. Kristen Bjorkman::: COVID scientific director for the BioFrontiers Institute at CU Boulder::: and Matthew McQueen::: professor of integrative physiology::: have been following these cases closely. They spoke with CU Boulder Today about the new player in the pandemic and how Coloradans can stop its spread by getting vaccinated. Read what they had to say at the link below.  COLORADO.EDU As delta variant threatens Colorado::: vaccines can stop its spread,2021-07-26 22:31:13,So great that the school is requiring students to be vaccinated to return to campus. Thank you CU,Bad journalism::: bad science. Vaccination is not a guarantee against transmission. Yes::: it may reduce transmission ‚Ä¶. but not significantly enough to warrant the blanket statements I see in this article.,https:// www.nytimes.com/ 2021/07/31/us/ covid-san-franci sco-hospital-de lta.html,https:// www.facebook.com /photo/ ?fbid=4944479552 57222&set=a.296 330275068992,Vaccination doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt get it. Or::: spread it! #fact,CU BOULDER do better.,There is no ‚ÄúDelta‚Äù variant. I asked the doctors at UCHealth Hospital what variant I had and they said there is no test to determine variants. You are either positive or negative with COVID. Stop pushing the vax for something that has a 99.997% survival rate and for something that doesn‚Äôt even exist (variants).,Counting cases is stupid fear-mongering. If hospitalization and deaths were out of control they'd be saying that... but they aren't. How tiny is the CFR these days? In gross numbers it's 1.7% Yesterday it was 14:::600 cases and 49 deaths::: or 0.3% [I'd mixed my time frames before. The 7-day average is 0.5%].  Reporting cases in headlines is nothing but fear-mongering. Change my mind.,"Or you could just nature take its course and get over it. Death is inevitable and should not be feared. Fircing a poisionoua vaccine on people. When the ""pandemic"" has killed litteraly less. Than one-fifth of one percent of Americans. Covid is a 99% survival rate. Your more likely to get a adverse side effect from the vaccine than getting and dying from covid. Not propaganda::: just simple math.",If the federal government was so concerned about the variants::: why are they allowing thousands of immigrants through the southern border?

In the wake of U.S. sprinter Sha'Carri Richardson's controversial pre-Olympic suspension for marijuana use::: we asked cannabis researcher Angela Bryan what the science really says.  Does weed really make you faster? Is it bad for you? Should it be banned from sport? Here's some news you can use ‚§µ  COLORADO.EDU Should marijuana still be banned from sport?,2021-07-09 18:00:13,First of all it is only tested for in competition periods::: the rest of the time party on Garth. But::: you can't legally drive under the influence correct? So what about those events that require accuracy::: unimpaired judgement and good reflexes for the safety of the athlete and other athletes? That would be most of them. Stoned equestrians jumping horses::: probably not a good idea? How about bicycle racing? How about javelin? Shooting? Archery? Would it help or hinder a pack of runners jostling for position in race? It's not just about performance enhancement. https:// www.usada.org/ athletes/ substances/ marijuana-faq/,Another rule that should be addressed immediately. As the article says it can‚Äôt be lumped into the archaic category as ‚Äúall drugs.‚Äù As usual a committee of old folks yielding power over young athletes::: finely tuned athletes::: can‚Äôt differentiate between a number if things.,If it's not talking about playing music or being a food critic::: it isn't a performance enhancing drug.,Alcohol isn‚Äôt banned‚Ä¶. That‚Äôs pretty much the answer right there. If they‚Äôre going to ban marijuana::: they should ban alcohol.,Can you imagine high jumpers floating over the high bar::: or pole vaulters launching themselves into orbit cause they been tokin the gonja?! Me neither. There‚Äôs nothing performance enhancing about marijuana.  On the other hand::: organizing stoned athletes would be much like herding cats.,No. It's a medicine for many people and the fact that an athlete can go out and party all weekend and drink themselves stupid but smoking a joint is against the rules is wrong. Cannabis is legal in numerous states and medicinally legal in even more. Cannabis is not a drug and shouldn't be treated as one. I personally believe excessive alcohol use should have higher consequences than cannabis use.,If anyone‚Äôs taken Cannabis & Wellness course at CU - we were told it‚Äôs a enhancer mentally and for recovery! Technically having access to something over someone else provides an advantage.  Cannabis is used medically for mental and physical benefits - so having one country allowed access to potential benefits compared to another component is unfair in an international scale - regardless if cannabis is a benefit individually.,Y'all realize a good portion of professional athletes from all the major leagues have been using cannabis for decades.... Right? Performance enhancing or not::: it's a hell of a lot better than pumping someone full of cortisone and opioids for the duration of their career.,"I can't believe they think this::: after the sport is over Smoke up all ya want :::not while training or in the sport. Come on now"" Aww""",Marijuana is typically used for pain. However smoking a lot of pot won‚Äôt be too much different than smoking a lot of cigarettes. You‚Äôll be out of breath quicker with reduced lung capacity.,Depending on the countries to decide for the event. One country should not dictate a policy to the rest of the world.,‚Äúdoes weed really make you faster‚Äù,Marijuana should not just be banned from sports. It should be canceled all together.

It was one of the worst massacres in American history::: yet::: for many Americans::: the Tulsa Race Massacre is not widely known. From May 31 to June 1::: 1921::: hundreds of white Tulsans‚Äîarmed and deputized by the local government‚Äîattacked::: pillaged and destroyed the thriving Black community of Greenwood::: Oklahoma::: also known as ‚ÄúBlack Wall Street.‚Äù  University of Colorado Law School Professor Suzette Malveaux represented more than 100 survivors pro bono in a 2003 federal lawsuit against the state of Oklahoma. Read about her experience working with massacre survivors::: why it took so long for them to seek justice and their continued fight in a recent Q&A with CU Boulder Today.  COLORADO.EDU 100 years later: Colorado Law professor reflects on Tulsa Race Massacre,2021-06-01 12:26:02,"100 yrs to understand :::find out and have pity on this action in history::: Wow""","TULSA RACE MASSACRE Torrey Snow WBAL  There is so much hullabaloo about the Tulsa Race Massacre::: and the demand for reparations for one of the most violent organized operations against the black community. I am glad that we are finally shining a light on this::: but I wanted to warn you all that there is a reason that this incident has largely gone unreported though our US History. Many people are taking the perspective that the Tulsa massacre was the result of plain old racism and white supremacy::: but that is only half the truth.  When you read up on this incident::: as I have::: many years ago::: you find that racism was a convenient scapegoat for the real enemy::: which was a local unchecked government disloyal to the values of the US Constitution::: and unaccountable to the voices of the oppressed. The reason that you have not heard about the Tulsa Race Massacre::: is because for many years::: people like myself have pointed to this incident as a total validation of unrestrained 2nd Amendment rights. We have also held this incident up as a reminder for what happens when too many resources are piled up within Government infrastructure. Finally::: we point out the risks of economic disenfranchisem ent of entire communities within our urban environments.  Make no mistake::: it's no accident that you have not heard of this event::: until the race hustlers felt that it was safe enough to broach this discussion without risking their allegiance to major radical leftist policy points::: like mass disarmament of US citizens::: and unrestrained government authority. The truth is::: many angry people in this Tulsa mob were enabled by the local police department to carry out the will of powerful business interests who feared the economic strength of the black community. The role of government was so hard to hide in this massacre that Local::: State::: and FEDERAL government coordinated efforts to make sure that no one heard about the incident. Even aircraft were deployed to bomb local business communities.  People are using this incident as a rallying cry for reparations and advancing the cause of more Government programs. The lessons to learn from the Tulsa Race massacre is the exact opposite. It is a careful warning about the dangers of unrestrained government and a disarmed American people. It is also a example of how racial hate has rarely been the real motive behind most racial policy. The real problem here::: was that Greenwood was a thriving economic power::: with strong family units::: powerful community::: and relatively independent from the benevolent hand of government.  When allowed to function::: the African American community has been historically resilient::: prosperous::: and fiercely independent. Power structures have always been threatened by this capability::: and have always fought to hamper the ability of African Americans to thrive without the support of government. This is literally the most obvious truth before any student of African-America n history.  I encourage you all to take this day::: and reflect on the memory of the thriving economic engine Greenwood. And I further challenge you to reflect on where our urban communities are today by comparison. Bob Woodson Sr. of The Woodson Center notes in his book::: ""Red::: White::: and Black - Rescuing American History from the Revisionists and Race Hustlers"" that within 2 decades::: the Greenwood community rebuilt even stronger than before. This part is often left out by the race hustlers. I would wager that the members of this community never left their skepticism of government behind::: took careful preparations to adequately arm themselves::: and spurn offers of more dependence on Government programs. They would laugh you to scorn if you came them with restrictions on 2nd Amendment rights::: and would offer scathing rebuke to black leaders who worship at the altar of government aid.  And a final note. Ask yourself what the real difference is between the Tulsa Race Massacre is::: and the unmitigated disaster that has been US Urban policy in places like Baltimore. Ask yourself who has inflicted more economic devastation. Ask yourself where the most bodies are piling up. Ask yourself who has the most hopeless education future in the nation. And ask yourself::: why Greenwood was able to rebuild in less than 20 years::: but we we are coming up on 6 decades of economic devastation in our urban communities. When you are ready to confront those hard truths::: I'll be here to help equip you with better solutions.",25 children!! :( https:// www.history.com/ topics/1990s/ waco-siege,Thanks for sharing this,"fake news. check wikipedia. gangs of armed blacks killed ten white people. here it is: The sheriff persuaded the group to leave the jail::: assuring them that he had the situation under control.

You're now requiring vaccinations which is fine::: yet you're absolutely NOT converting all the remote classes back to in-person classes! And using the excuse that students signed up for it because it was remote? They signed up that way because it was the only thing available. This is complete bait and switch.

I thank President Kennedy for his service to the University of Colorado. His leadership during this historic pandemic required a unique combination of flexibility and understanding that will continue to serve us into the future. I have appreciated working with President Kennedy over the past two years as he worked to advance the university and serve the people of Colorado.  Our campus will continue to focus on returning to a fuller student experience this fall; improving diversity::: equity and inclusion; and ensuring our fiscal resilience.  CU Boulder campus leaders and I stand ready with our colleagues across the CU system to support our University of Colorado regents as they embark upon this transition.

In support of the university‚Äôs commitment to health and safety::: CU Boulder will require faculty::: staff and students to receive the COVID-19 vaccine before the fall 2021 semester. This is in alignment with the decision to institute this requirement for the CU system. The vaccine requirement will allow the campus to more fully return to a traditional campus experience for the fall 2021 semester.  For more information about the process::: timeline and approach and for answers to frequently asked questions::: click the link ‚û° https://bit.ly/2QIfBIO  PRESIDENT.CU.EDU CU Requires Vaccine for Fall Semester 2021  University of Colorado system April 28::: 2021 at 1:47 PM ¬∑  The University of Colorado will require that all CU students::: faculty and staff receive a COVID-19 vaccine before the start of fall semester 2021.,2021-04-28 20:54:37,I hope people who do not want the vaccine plan on NEVER attending a concert or live event again.,"What a ridiculously stupid decision. COVID vaccination is a personal choice::: forcing students to get vaccinated in order to get a ""traditional campus experience"" is outright segregation. Measles::: Mumps::: and Rubella are all significantly more contagious than COVID-19.",In US The total covid deaths for age group 18 to 29 is 2275. Total covid cases in us is 25.3 million. You can do the math.,I hope CU will immediately stop accepting public funding if they are going to act like a private entity making health related requirements for their staff and students.,So glad to hear this::: as I expect it will help the entire state stay safe and avoid outbreaks. Makes sense to add it to the numerous vaccinations already required for students on campus. So pleased with my vaccine experience::: and I hope the rollout will continue with good momentum. Go Buffs!,Good! It will be complaints::: I‚Äôm guessing mostly from the parents. The students are adults and they can make their decisions for what works for them. Vaccines are voluntary in the same sense that your admission to the University is also voluntary,I can‚Äôt get my arms around the reasoning that pharmaceutical companies are ‚Äúexperimenting‚Äù on every person in the world. Better yet::: among the first groups to be ‚Äúexperimented‚Äù on? Every physician and surgeon on the planet. Does it seem reasonable to you that they would choose this particular group to ‚Äúexperiment‚Äù on if they were behind closed doors saying ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what‚Äôll happen... it might kill a lot of them...‚Äù. Does it make sense that the vast majority of physicians and surgeons (you know::: the people who understand the science) would enthusiasticall y get vaccinated and have their families get vaccinated as well. If they‚Äôre all doing it because they have a death wish and want to kill their families::: that‚Äôd be a hell of a coincidence::: don‚Äôt you think?  It‚Äôs an argument that defies logic and basic common sense.,The right response to a public health crisis. Thank you for setting the example and working to keep the ‚Äúherd‚Äù safe. You‚Äôll lose some ‚Äúanti-vaxers‚Äù but that‚Äôs not really a loss.,Our son will be an incoming freshman next fall. Our family 100% supports this decision. Thank You University of Colorado!,This is absolutely the right call. Also::: this requirement isn‚Äôt actually ‚Äúmandatory‚Äù (read the exemptions part) because they‚Äôre still allowing medical and non-medical exemptions.,Thank God I already graduated. Forcing people to take the vaccine before they attend? That sounds a little bit coerce.,As a Boulder Business owner::: thank you CU. This action will help to keep our community healthy and our businesses thriving.,Good luck in court CU::: can‚Äôt force your employees to take an experimental vaccine. Boulder‚Äôs gone to crap and CU‚Äôs right on its tail.,Thank you! As a parent of 2 CU students next fall::: I applaud this decision in favor of science and normalcy,I 100% support CU on taking a step that will allow the academic experience to return to a format that has been successful for year. The risk associated to the vaccine versus the known risk of the virus on society should be an easy choice for us. Unless you have a medical or spiritual reason to not receive the vaccine this request is no different then all the other medical information that is required to send your student to school.,The military requires its members to get every vaccine available for the regions of the world a service member may travel to. But::: because the covid vaccine is EUA they cannot force its members to get the vaccine::: neither can these colleges. Put that in your pipe and smoke it CU.,Here come all the victims 1. No one is forcing you to attend 2. There are medical and non medical exemptions 3. Some of you are not even pursuing an education currently and it doesn‚Äôt apply to you anyway.  So many angry people ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,I don‚Äôt understand why people are complaining about a mandatory (with exemptions) covid vaccine requirement. If you attended public school in Colorado::: if you had no exemptions::: you were required all of these vaccinations:  Varicella::: Hep B::: MMR::: DTaP::: Polio::: and Tdap.  All of which are required to enter public schools in Colorado. If you don‚Äôt want to get the covid vaccine::: you can‚Äôt attend CU,Hmmm. I‚Äôm not sure this is a good idea. Optional would be better only because you don‚Äôt know a person‚Äôs individual circumstances. You can‚Äôt paint a broad brush on people. We are trying to get rid of the mindset that all people are the same aren‚Äôt we?,This not ok! Vaccines should Be a recommended option like the flu shot NOT forced on students!,Very smart! Glad to see CU is doing this. No different than having your other shots required for school. üëç,I hope University of Colorado Boulder plans on giving refunds to the students who have paid deposits and housing fees under the premise that this would not be mandatory and who will now choose to go elsewhere.,No way! Vaccines are a choice not required. Especially if there are medical considerations.,Wow that completely authoritative.. . force people to have the vaccine in order to work or take classes,This is disgusting! Ashamed to be an alumni for a sheepish university.,Did you go to public school? You have to get vaccines. Did you go to college? You have to get vaccines. Don't want the vaccine? Don't go to UC Boulder. Simple.,Mandates- ok- getting right in line with- you know- government,The comments here sadden me. May the science continue and save millions of others from dying.,If you‚Äôre worried about the vaccine::: CU probably isn‚Äôt the school for you. If you‚Äôve attended a CU frat party or plan to::: you shouldn‚Äôt be worried about getting the vaccine/what‚Äôs in it. You‚Äôve already come across far worse,I hope some parents that base their decision on facts will send their children someplace else. This is in unfortunate::: but dollars lost is what speaks most. If you choose to get the vaccine what are concerned about with the unvaccinated?,I wouldn‚Äôt have sent my kids there if they were that age anyway but I‚Äôll remember this when they are of the age for the bad leadership,Why did you accept students from around the world in the middle of a pandemic but site in the beginning ‚Äúcommitment to health and safety ‚Äú. Smh.,Ummm... you can‚Äôt mandate a vaccine that is still listed as experimental or emergency,What a load of crap. Young people have very little risk from Covid. Forcing them to get an experimental::: emergency use only drug to continue their education is shameful.,You can not ‚Äúrequire‚Äù something that has not been fully approved. These vaccines are still in the development/ study stage. Any one of us who has or has not gotten it are part of a larger study. Poor move on CU‚Äôs part!,As a state funded public institution is this legal?,I become less and less proud to be a Buff every day.,In the 80s we questioned authority::: now its get in line for your medicine?  Sad day to be a Buff,Wow- the University keeps upping the ante on bad decision making.,Bravo! Excellent decision.,How much $$$$ was CU offered from the pharmaceutical company to do this to the students??? Wow!! Shocked,Unbelievable. Gotta love it when an esteemed institution of higher learning tells their students that they should NOT think for themselves. A vaccine that close to half of front-line workers aren‚Äôt even rushing to get. Yet CU is going to mandate this experimental vaccine for the least susceptible population. Are you going to logistically enforce this mandate every year? Because it will be an annual vaccine.,What about those that recovered from COVID-19 that have better antibodies than those with vaccine. This seems like discrimination and a right to choice issue,Good decision!!! I can‚Äôt wait to have a mostly normal school year!,Thank you! Looking forward to a return to normalcy next year for both my CU students!,Do u require people to get the flu shot as well?,This is very disappointing!! ! The kids who have had Covid will have antibodies. Why is this mandatory?,Dumbest thing ever. Makes sense coming from Boulder though.,All these people saying thank you...know know thank you people for being the lab rats::: much appreciated,That‚Äôs messed up.,I believe there should be accomodations for those who can show antibodies exist through serology testing::: but with so much resistance out there along with the careless behavior of college students::: this is a good policy. Why should students have the right to bring Covid home to thier parents and grandparents? As well::: it advances the efforts of achieving herd immunity.,Doesn‚Äôt anyone look at the facts ? No just follow along with the herd Schools have never been proven to be a place of super spreader of this virus !!!,If we've all gotten proper vaccines on campus::: are we still going to have to wear masks and social distance? Once Colorado::: Boulder::: and the CU campus have all hit north of 70% vaccination::: it would seem a bit overkill to keep the masks and distancing.,These comments are going to be super fun!,So much for freedom of choice to manage one‚Äôs own health care.,WSU is requiring all students to be fully vaccinated as well! Go Cougs... (Alex got her second shot yesterday).,Make it easy for them! Your current students have been struggling to get this done.,college students are adults::: let them make their own decisions. I bet if they want to continue their studies at CU they will get the vaccine with little hesitation. If they haven't already. They don't need a permission slip from the parents to get the Jab if they want it,Is there lowers in the page to advise me what to do as my daughter not convinced to take the vaccine while it‚Äôs still under clinical trail . Thank you,Remember all the polio kids in college? There arent any. We are vaccinated.,Thank you for helping protect your students::: staff and faculty (including a family member with MS)!,As a veteran and a present student!  I have my reason to choose my own health practices over a govt mandated now school mandated vaccination of a test shot not yet existed 1 year to show its post health analysis.  I guess as an adult non traditional student I can‚Äôt complete my degree work ! It‚Äôs my choice to not be vaccinated by these shots. My health has survived 14 months as an essential worker!  This is also the steps towards health discrimination across the world .,Don‚Äôt necessarily agree::: but if it will allow me to attend class again without a mask I‚Äôm fine with it. So::: University of Colorado Boulder will students still be required to wear masks or can we make it optional???,Considering we have to have vaccines anyways from through grade school it‚Äôs just another precaution. Rather be on campus than this self taught B.S.,From what I read::: you are allowed to opt out. I know a lot of people are for the vaccine::: & many are hesitant or do not want to get it. So CU is saying to get it::: but there is a way to still attend CU & not get it. I didn't see anyone comment that::: so I did for ya. ;),Medical and non-medical exemptions,This is why I won‚Äôt donate üôÇ. Thanks for the call Sam! Make sure to take me off all of your lists. Sad for future students. My body::: my choice... right?,Garbage. There is a 99% chance that you'd be just fine if you even got covid. This is crossing individual liberty lines... if CU were private they could do whatever they please but they aren't. Just curious if the university will compensate individuals and families effected negatively by the covid vaccine?,Can't find enough people to take your shot so now you push it off on kids that are in no danger. I hope the people revolt and stop going to your stupid over charged campuses.,Find a new school don‚Äôt poison yourself,What are the details on the serology testing showing the presence of COVID antibodies?,Shit::: maybe attendance will suffer. Our southern (SEC) (conservative) schools are available.,I'm highly allergic !,Who is the bureaucrat behind this page? https:// www.cu.edu/ vaccine-requirem ent  Q: The COVID vaccines in use have Experimental Use Designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

Whether you have young children or they're grown::: when scary or sad things happen in the world::: they look to the adults that surround them to help them feel safe and understand what is happening. This can feel tricky and challenging::: particularly when the adults themselves are also responding to and making sense of the same experience.

A condition for being part of CU Boulder is accountability to each other and to the community at all times. Read more from Chancellor DiStefano‚Äôs letter to campus about Saturday‚Äôs events on University Hill::: including details about disciplinary action and guidance for quarantine::: testing and in-person classes this week:  COLORADO.EDU Office of the Chancellor - University Hill large-scale disturbance March 6,2021-03-07 20:01:27,I will also add that it's a *little rich* for the university to condemn this riot when they literally employed and paid a professor who spoke at the Capitol Insurrection and helped to incite the crowd to attack a sitting Congress. This individual continued to be paid by the University even following his speech on 1/6/21. As someone who lives in DC::: I was appalled by the University's decision::: after seeing how the Insurrection impacted my community and country. So please spare me the pearl clutching::: Chancellor. You don't have a problem with riots::: you have a problem with public relations when it hits close to YOUR home. Students should be held responsible for their actions::: just as John Eastman should have received the gift of consequences for his. https:// www.denverpost.c om/2021/01/08/ john-eastman-ele cton-fraud-cu-b oulder/,The militarization of this situation-\-\send ing in the SWAT team for a college party-\-\is absolutely reprehensible. Calling in Longmont police (30-40 mins away) for a college party? Escalation by the police. Water cannon? Tear gas? All escalation. Do what you have to do with your disciplinary code but it's important to see this as it is: An incredibly frightening and inappropriate escalation of the situation by Boulder County that could have ended in some frightening and violent outcomes. They need to put the (water) guns down and learn something about town-gown relations and community policing.,Thank for your quick decisive action regarding the irresponsible students from the last 2 weekends. What will you be doing to make sure that there is not a 3rd infraction in the coming weeks as the weather warms up?,This is shameful behavior.,I do hope the university plans to expel the people involved. Also::: disband the fraternities / sororities involved. My elementary-aged kids have been schooling online at home the entire year. I was hoping to actually send them back after spring break::: but now will have to watch for the inevitable spike in cases. Doubt my kids will get to be in-person this year at all. I'm hoping and praying the vaccine program stays ahead of the spread of the variants and that the vaccines aren't rendered completely ineffective due to the variants. These college students need to understand they don't live in a vacuum and their actions impact other people.,This is a serious issue and those responsible for riotous behavior should be accountable. I just have a hard time with the chancellor lecturing about COVID.  To be clear::: I take COVID seriously. I haven‚Äôt been to a bar or restaurant in over a year. When I drove to Colorado to go skiing::: I stuck to small operators where I didn‚Äôt have to take a ski bus and ate lunch on my car. Full mask compliance when inside and away from home.  But we now know that outdoor transmission is rare::: maybe even non existent. https:// www.theguardian. com/world/2021/ feb/19/ how-the-beach-su per-spreader-my th-can-inform-u ks-future-covid -response  How did the chancellor get it? A mask less meeting? Family gathering? A conference? Dining? All riskier activities than an outdoor party.  And I‚Äôm not saying that the party was a good idea::: far from it. And the behavior afterwards was worse. But for the chancellor to lecture about COVID when his own behavior was riskier than this event... I‚Äôm not here for it.,As CU alumni this is beyond embarrassing::: but unfortunately::: expected behavior from a certain group of students at CU who tend to have complete disregard for human decency. CU students who actually follow protocols and have an ounce of respect for fellow students and their community::: please help keep the delinquents responsible as they are making you all look very bad.,I know my kid was at work. That‚Äôs all he does when not at class. When I was there::: I too avoided the Hill at all costs. We are worker/ scholarship bees and have no time for this. He is in a degree still meeting face to face. Please go remote for a couple weeks. Keep them as safe as you can. All of them. Even the ones who caused this bs. They deserve consequences and removal but they don‚Äôt deserve a bout of covid. I wouldn‚Äôt wish that on anyone. Please. It‚Äôs just the right thing to do.,CU put tuition concerns before community back in the fall::: and again this spring. These are predictable consequences. Go online before the variants get out of control and the schools have to close once again. CU has done its neighbors far too much damage.,As an Alumni who lives abroad::: reading this in international news is beyond embarrassing. CU has their hands full if they plan on disiplining all those who endangered the community. By the look of things::: hundreds of studnets were at the party not following health saftey protocols. They ALL need to be held accountable in one way or another. Not expulsion for all obviously::: but some type if reprimand is nesccery. When I was at CU::: students would protest on Folsom field by smoking pot once a year. One time::: CU sent police officers with video cameras and took pictures individual students faces::: posted them online::: and tried disciplining students that were identified. Those students back in the day were only putting thenselves at a little risk::: but never the entire community. My point is these students endangered the entire community::: and action must be taken for all the participants.,This made the national news! What a disgrace and an embarrassment! Arrests and expulsion::: along with fines are a must. No respect for property or COVID protocols. What a bunch of brats! GROW THE FU*K UP.,"Arrests and expulsions should be made public so that those who do follow the rules will know that this letter is not just lip service. The videos that I saw where students were yelling ""f*ck 12"" while they demolished cars and property::: in the midst of violating public health mandates::: were embarrassing to watch.","Just a reminder that the Too Much Tuition::: CU is still demanding fair compensation for this BS of a year they call ""education"" #sharethecares www.toomuchtuit ioncu.com",I don‚Äôt seem to hear about this behavior happening at other college campuses. Why does it happen here?,There are seriously going to still be in person classes??? You're willing to put all of the CU staff and students in danger when it could be avoided by going back online for 2 weeks??,"""We have consulted with our public health experts::: and anyone who attended the Hill gathering is advised to quarantine immediately and complete a COVID-19 monitoring test on Thursday or Friday."" Sure::: like that's gonna happen. These partiers don't seem like they will follow any of the rules",Expell every single student that were in social media videos. stop the frats and sororities immediately by suspending. Completely unacceptable. Disgusting . Right on frat row.,Expecting people from age 17 to 25 to retreat inside for 12 months::: not party::: get together in large groups is like building a bomb. It‚Äôs idiotic and has proven to be the wrong way to handle this situation. How many people in this age category died from Covid? And I mean from Covid::: not from something else like a gun shot but tested positive. Lots test positive with never a day of being sick,Disturbance? You mean riot::: correct.? What‚Äôs disturbing is the response from CU Boulder leadership. Not nearly as harsh or comprehensive enough.,Name reasons why we shouldn‚Äôt encourage our students who comply and work hard not to transfer out? The whole country knows about this.  You need to make a HUGE example of this. We did not sign up for this. Make your school serious,I‚Äôm a CU Alumni and this is embarrassing and shameful. Expel these students because they certainly don‚Äôt exhibit who we are Colorado.,Chancellor DiStefano::: deal harshly with these people. Destroying property::: throwing bricks at police::: violation of signed-and-agre ed-to CU behavior::: etc. Permanent expulsion::: then turn this over to Boulder City officials for prosecution. After the CU alert went out to all students and staff on phones::: computer::: media::: to avoid the area or face consequences... that meant that anyone there could be sanctioned for violating CU policy... not to mention those who committed crimes. (and the collective GPA across campus will probably go up if the jerks are summarily thrown out!!!!!!!!!!!! !!),We deferred my son's senior year to avoid this exact scenario. It's not the institutions fault::: nevertheless::: I doubt anyone is surprised it happened.,Expulsion would do them well as Covid has been going on a year and all University‚Äôs have had rules in place for a minimum of two semesters!,You guys never enforce consequences for the frats because you want their daddy's football money. The whole campus is a drain on this city.,"Where was all this condemnation for the BLM and Antifa riot::: protests::: looting and murders they committed?

SPOILED kids that get drunk and have NO regard for human life other than me::: myself and I. The ME generation is alive and well at University of Colorado::: Boulder. Drunk and irresponsible students throwing bricks at police officers. They are obviously cult followers of Donald Trump/Duck/ Dumpf.

We are aware of a large party on University Hill on Saturday evening and allegations of violence toward police officers responding to the scene. We condemn this conduct. It is unacceptable and irresponsible::: particularly in light of the volume of training::: communication and enforcement the campus and city have dedicated to ensuring compliance with COVID-19 public health orders.  Any student who is found responsible for having engaged in acts of violence toward law enforcement or other first responders will be removed from CU Boulder and not readmitted.  Read more at alerts.colorado.edu,2021-03-07 05:23:18,What about the students who flipped the car? Surely it shouldn't be hard to identify them. Hope that everyone who attended are held responsible. They're putting our community at risk!,As a Boulder Native::: I'm ashamed at the students acting violently and stupidly tonight. Hope they're all taught a lesson and expelled. You don't deserve a diploma from such a great University. Criminal charges should also be filed against them.,So not the Boulder I knew.,"As long as you keep referring to university student as ""KIDS""::: they will continue to act like such. Students are legally adults getting an education that others in this country can not have access to. They should be working toward that goal::: and show responsiblity and respect for the community that is hosting them. I hope they all get suspended and face the consequences of their acts.","While violence is not acceptable and never an appropriate response I would want to know the entire story. When I was at CU (family also lived in Boulder) the Boulder police were the biggest group of arrogant jerks around. The old motto for police was ""to serve and protect"". In Boulder it was ""to harass and detain"". Everyone of my personal encounters with them was bad...and I was never involved in anything that broke the law! I truly hope they have gotten better.",I have been so impressed with the way CU Boulder has handled this pandemic and communicated responsible behavior to its entire community. So I‚Äôm sad to see this news out of Boulder.  And I‚Äôm disgusted. SWAT officers hit with bricks at a college party?!? An armored vehicle and fire truck received heavy damage::: a girl‚Äôs car was destroyed. Covid undoubtedly spread and now local businesses will have to shut back down just as things are getting started again.  This is a small percentage of CU Boulder students who continue to ruin things for everyone else. They don‚Äôt adhere to rules and keep partying regardless of covid. I just don‚Äôt understand how these young adults - I repeat adults! - can be so very disrespectful. This behavior is so so selfish.,The kids on the hill were partying all day while the Boulder police and fire department did nothing to stop them! Hell::: police and firemen were honking their horns at groups of girls walking by participating in some of the partying themselves. Y‚Äôall ain‚Äôt worried about the students nor if they were spreading COVID until they started destroying property,As a graduate of CU::: I totally agree that they should have consequences for their actions. Their behavior shines a very bad light on our University and Boulder as a whole. We all want to have big gatherings with friends and family we haven‚Äôt seen in over a year::: but we‚Äôre not home free yet with this pandemic.,Send the students home! They do not care about COvid::: our community::: our schools and children! They‚Äôre completely disrespectful and need to go home!,What do you expect after years of kids hearing adults bash all police; they have zero respect for all law enforcement.,As a Boulder native::: CU legacy and graduate::: I am appalled at those involved with this violence at a time when so many are suffering. Shame on you!,Wow::: some nasty comments here. Let‚Äôs just hope there were no serious injuries. Agree that there should be consequences for any students showing violence against the police.,Everyone who attended should be expelled. This is disgusting behavior.,Good. The videos of the irresponsible maskless partying::: neighborhood destruction and attacks of responders is appalling.,This is outrageous behavior. They should not be here. Send them home. How dare they come here and threaten the health and safety of this community. CU should be ashamed!! You can do better!,Wow::: an actual consequence::: better late than never.,"Expel them and keep our responsible students safe!! They have no business at CU and they are walking back to campus in droves::: unmasked. As an alum and parent::: I'm appalled at the lack of safety. Tuition is NOT more important than my child's safety! You have compromised it with a less than ""no tolerance"" policy for behavior such as this!",Boulder call in your social workers! Remember saying DEFUND the police::: this is one of the repercussions. Expel! Restitution! Criminal Charges!,What they meant was  Any student** who is not the child of a CU benefactor or donor* who is found responsible for having engaged in acts of violence toward law enforcement or other first responders will be removed from CU Boulder and not readmitted.  Read more at alerts.colorado .edu,I hate to blame politics but young people now live in an anti-police culture::: perpetuated by the Democrat politicians they blindly vote for.,i hope you as the school does something to those kids. they deserve to be punished ::: they get sway with too much here. and you do mot hold them accountable at all. disappointing,Open back up ... you treat the students like prisoners ... ‚Äúno gatherings of two or more‚Äù last semester ... the administration as well as city and county officials are to blame,Just those students having engaged in acts of violence? Attending such a large gathering is also an act of violence towards our community! Send them all home!,When I was in College::: we had parties and a lot of parties. We wouldn‚Äôt even consider being disrespectful or do damage. We had a thing called ‚ÄúCollege Days‚Äù it was wild and fun but that was it. No police no property damage. This truly sucks!! The little shits !!,Every single student who was there needs to be expelled from CU.,Accountable for their actions- a lesson they‚Äôd best learn now than later in life. Expel them,The students involved in the violence against police and damage to property should be identified and prosecuted to the fullest extent the law allows. Their privilege of attending the University of Colorado also should end quickly and without debate. Their actions do not represent the students of CU and they need to be held accountable. No candy ass BS. Send them packing.,They watched people get away with that behavior in Seattle::: LA and everywhere else for the past year::: so now it's ok to disrespect police and destroy things when you don't get your way,There are multiple CU students laugh reacting comments throughout this comments section as an act of passive aggression.  They should be the first to be looked at.  Such selfish::: apathetic behavior.,Why are you removing the student because they went to a party engaged in violence what does that have to do with paying fro education at your school? The law will deal with the student you need to engage in teaching your students.,Expel every student that was there. Arrest all non students. Literally so irresponsible. CU::: get your students in check.,I agree get off your high horse. Students will party in Boulder.,They should be expelled.,I lived on 12th::: next to the Youth Hostel. We definitely partied but were never interested in nor did it occur to us to commit any violence. We were having too great a time.,Nothing to worry about::: they were merely protesting,Are you really surprised that students would be hateful to Cops when you're always screaming defund the police::: defend the police and fry the pigs. You created these brats and now you're surprised they're disrespectful to the police,Seeing a lot of comments here saying ‚Äúoh who cares‚Äù about this violence against police doing their jobs...but it‚Äôs the same people who would say otherwise if it wasn‚Äôt white college kids. Just saying.,Lock a bunch of college kids up in a dorm for a year and eventually they will push back and throw a huge party project X style. Nobody was killed. Make the students pay for the damages and call it a day,Unfortunately there are literally 2 Boulders::: the hard working and highly educated lovers of nature and good decent citizens of all ages and the over entitled frat and sorority types with warped sense of privilege and invulnerability ::: impervious to law as trust funds warrant family private lawyers and some old school misogynistic racists. The second is a minority BUT they are deeply potent issues for this city. The school will NEVER expel revenue driving students at a time when enrollments are lowering so as an employee of NYU where I can attest the lse student will walk right into class late on Monday and continue denigrating fine institutions and plagerising their way straight into their corporate careers. I wish this wasn't true but even when the Matthew Sheppard thing occurred in Wyoming way back::: I heard some of the people involved just watched and did nothing about it. These are problems that the community NEED to keep the school honest in enforcing.,Embarrassed that this non-masked showing made the Sunday morning national news. Get it together CU students.,Looks who is is talking. Talk of the pot calling the kettle black. CU is unacceptable and irresponsible::: for opening the campus during a pandemic. shameful and what did they expect was going to happen. CU all about the $$$$ safety be damned,I‚Äôm sure that the email that said RUN HIDE FIGHT that came directly from the University did not help.,Expel them. Make them accountable!,Dear entitled a**holes: if you want to party::: you‚Äôll have to wait for the pandemic to end just like the rest of us.,Guess we're gonna find out how good the drones are as far as recording goes.,CU is just full of trust fund kids. Always had mommy and daddy pay their way and never got punched in the mouth when needed.,Hey Kids::: Please don‚Äôt misconstrue the freedom you have to live in Boulder and enjoy the life you have for the ability to break the law. It wasn‚Äôt ok when I attended CU ‚Äò88-92::: and it‚Äôs not ok now. It‚Äôs a privilege to live in a beautiful place::: go to a good school and walk this earth freely. Don‚Äôt fuck it Up!,This party was going on for hours before they decided to break it up . Should have been done way earlier. Spoiled white entitled brats.,But y'all goofballs thought it was okay to not only reopen campus but also charge everyone the same tuition?  How do y'all not understand that this is your own fault,‚ÄúBacking the blue‚Äù is very unBoulderish... .don‚Äôt you think,I think anyone who participated in ANY of the violence should have this happen. They destroyed someone‚Äôs car and countless other pieces of people‚Äôs property!,This message sounds like a kindergarten teacher wrote it and sent it as she was addressing a room of five years olds. I thought CU students were supposed to be adults. If they are legally adults::: they nerd to be addressed and treated as adults with strictly adult consequences. Embarrassed to admit I am an alum.,So you're telling them to self quarantine? Is that all you are going to do? Obviously they won't comply::: and this will hurt the entire community. You know::: the ones that live here and pay the ridiculous taxes? The people who work here and are effected by shut downs? Send them home!,Maybe if you all weren‚Äôt a bunch of f‚Äôing dbags who at one point created a law that 2 people::: even if they lived together::: couldn‚Äôt go outside in public with one another (which you then changed due to legitimate public outage) this wouldn‚Äôt have happened. I don‚Äôt condone destruction of property or violence again police officers (even though half the people in Boulder support it) but you brought this on yourself. Party on!!! Willing to contribute you your gofundme pages!,CU administration. Your students are laughing in the face of this pandemic again. As an RN with an immunocompromis ed family member I must say again send them home. ‚Äúyou‚Äù have blood on your hands.,How many of you were there in person? Passing judgement without facts -CU students were not the only ones involved -many high school kids and locals were drawn to the area to party -many CU students walked away when it became dangerous -but u know it‚Äôs like the Capitol Riots blame it on those that fit your agenda and your opinion,Looks like damage control is in order,Anyone can be on the hill so who can say that ALL of those being stupid were CU students? However::: I have a feeling that those CU students were probably not just your average hard working Colorado resident who is going into great debt to be able to further his/her education!,"DO you EVEN remember being in college? I suppose you did not party and did your parents or officials call the police on you???? Shame on YOU. Remember a guy named TRUMP? What happened when he sent the police in on peaceful marches??? To call the police means to bring in violence. The police no longer protect and serve...it has been harrass and detain as of late and it is turning into ketamize and kill::: if not then beat them up. Once again:::""SHAME ON YOU.""",Like the riots on the Hill in 1997? Yeah. I was there. Unfortunately::: this isn't new behavior.,Should have canceled this year in the fall.. your kids are trash and your response to covid has been trash... no more state funding for CU,Come on buffs::: be better! You‚Äôre soiling the school‚Äôs name and making all of us (alums and current students) look bad,Come on Gen Z cool it will you. Stop being a bunch of sheep. Fight for things that matter the right way and don‚Äôt tarnish our school.,That whole time I was on a zoom call with my kid who is a CU Boulder student...so I know where he was...but if he ever were at a rave like that...I would not wait for CU to act...he'd be on the next plane home outta Denver....,Not ok littering liquor bottles and beer cans and vandalizing cars even aside from violating Pandemic protocols.  Come on CU Boulder students::: you‚Äôre better than this!,I just did some research. According to the CU website::: the number of enrolled students is about 30:::000. They are saying that the riot on The Hill consisted of about 900 people. Discounting the fact that the may not have all be CU students::: that still means that 900 is 3% (3%!) of the total enrollment. I'm not justifying what happened::: just trying to give a little perspective.,Wow. Boot-lickers back in 95 and boot-lickers still today. C.U. is only about the cash and never about the students. Your hypocrisy is showing.,Yes. This violates the student code of conduct. As an alumnus::: I‚Äôm glad the university is taking this stand.,I do support expelling them::: yet CU Boulder need to question the motive of such behavior.,Shameful and ridiculous. It will be easy to identify most of the students from social media. Im sure the pompous ass holes were live. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,Loving the comments. Especially from conservatives. Y‚Äôall are still believing Covid isn‚Äôt real or is being used to take people‚Äôs liberties::: so you‚Äôre supportive of them having this party::: but you‚Äôre sidestepping the fact that they attacked police officers when y‚Äôall probably scream blue lives matter. You guys probably also are the kind who have talked about how people need to ‚Äújust follow the law‚Äù and ‚Äúrespect police‚Äù.

CU Alert: Boulder Police is responding to a large party in the area of 10th & Pennsylvania. People in the area could be subject to arrest and CU sanctions.,2021-03-07 03:16:30,Send them packing we don't want them here::: make them reapply::: CU should not muck about this time::: no tolerance this time around::: we are all sick of having to quarantine because of selfish negligent students who don't,Whoever wrote this clearly wasn't invited...,Arrest them all... Anyone found doing this should be put in a public database::: even without arrest::: so we can look them up and refuse any service to them... Especially piercing them UNDER THEIR DAMN MASK!,so disappointing it is happening...sor ry for the students that actually are following protocols...sel fish & immature send them packing!,Send them all packing. CU and Boulder County have been clear on the restrictions and the majority of students are following them. The people who are partying are not respecting the school or the town.,yeah no::: resume in person classes::: we can totally trust the students to be responsible!,I‚Äôm kinda shocked at the comments from adults on here!! There are a lot of kids and parents who work their butts off to attend CU because it is a really great school. Yes it is super unfortunate that these kids decided that vandalism and violence was okay::: but that wasn‚Äôt every kid in that crowd! It‚Äôs also unfortunate that this block party was allowed to continue for hours and hours before being broken up. The violence and vandalism probably would have been much less or wouldn‚Äôt have happened at all. I don‚Äôt condone the large group just yet with covid::: but they (all of us) have been isolated for so long and I don‚Äôt blame them for wanting to gather on a nice day outside to be with friends. Calling these kids garbage and other derogatory words is just $hitty.,I can't believe CU allowed students to come back in person at all in the first place. I want that place shut down. If BVSD has to shut down again due to this criminal behavior::: SHAME on CU.,All the alumni posting angry about this would definitely have gone to that party if they were in school for it. Especially after losing two years of college life to a pandemic. Glad to see boulder is still having fun,"Just a reminder that the Too Much Tuition::: CU is still demanding fair compensation for this BS of a year they call ""education"" #sharethecares www.toomuchtuit ioncu.com",Wow::: I though the good old days of the Hill Rioting we're gone with the ‚Äò90s. ü§™Just when you think Boulder is completely gentrified into some sort of ultra superior spiritual order::: The Hill lights itself fire on remind everyone that a piece of Boulder‚Äôs chaotic dark side still exists. Maybe that delapidated student housing with its douchey Frat boy energy can never be washed clean. If only the civil unrest was for a worthy cause. üò©,Sheeeiit! You could spit in my mouth and accelerate my symptoms. No masks? Sounds awesome! Wish I were there. I‚Äôd be sucking face with some random Tri-Delt with my MAGA hat on. I know for a fact all the low testosterone beta art majors from this thread wouldn‚Äôt have been there.,This happened a lot in the 90‚Äôs and early 2000‚Äôs::: couch burnings::: large parties::: etc. Nothing new here::: just a bunch of pent up angst. Hard to blame them honesty. The youth wanting to party. Imagine that..,Heard it was a cough party. One cough to get in::: two coughs to get a keg stand::: three cough for a cup of beer. Wild shit.,CU opens in the middle of a pandemic::: what did they expect. This is CU fault for opening the campus which they did for money with no regard for the safety of the students or community. shameful,That‚Äôs not a party that‚Äôs a riot,So many good kids that are students at CU::: who were not at this party::: being raked over the coals! Again::: the few bad apples spoil things for all.,What a valuable use of police resources,EXPEL! Hold these individuals accountable!,Mommy and daddy will not be happy when these kids lose their academic privilege and have to go to the local community college instead,I live on Aparaphoe and have seen 10 cruisers go flying by::: including a swat truck!!,Let me guess Covid Violation Rules???,And the lockdowns continue. Sad,Good! Tired of these selfish children being the exact problem and reason we're 1 year into this mess and not done with it,Not ok littering liquor bottles and beer cans and vandalizing cars even aside from violating Pandemic protocols.  Come on CU Boulder students::: you‚Äôre better than this!,Quarantine compels us to stay home!!!!!!!!!,Good God ! The world's gone CRAZY ..college students drinking ...,By DS said they flipped a car,Cancel in person classes this week and next week. i‚Äôm not attending my class in person after this covid spreader.,Kids are partying in college?,OP is just mad they didn‚Äôt get invited. Nerd.,Who wants to go streaking,What a stain on CU and the state of Colorado. Arrest them and expel them. No excuse for this garbage.,Goddamn i miss college....,Robert Andrew Cortez,Bobby Bull Soechting,Kick them out.,Courtney Saindon,Fuck you libtards. What a bunch of criminals. A bunch of kids having a party. Call in the FBI,All my bills cleared via Carl_linknet22 on Instagram::: I‚Äôm so much grateful ::: 10x of my money made in hours,I just came here for the comments. These comments are funny as hell,Nicely done!,Dang I loved college.,Drink till they're cute y'all. Don't drink and drive.

From the chancellor: Upholding our values and democracy  Read the full message below:  COLORADO.EDU From the Chancellor - Upholding our values and democracy,2021-01-08 00:31:58,Chancellor::: You might want to consider the possibility that your faculty member participated in an event that was part of a coup to overthrow the US Government. At the very least::: he should be suspended and investigated until the facts and truth are determined.,Chancellor DiStefano::: your words are strong but lack of action is inappropriate. Please see this analysis that demonstrates why John Eastman‚Äôs actions were incitement . https:// www.latimes.com/ opinion/story/ 2021-01-08/ chapman-universi ty-professor-he lped-incite-vio lent-insurrecti on Incitement of a violent attack on the members of Congress::: election process and Capitol::: constitutes crimes against the United States and its citizens. See 18 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß 2101 and 373 for starters. John Eastman should be immediately dismissed. CU should not harbor::: even for several months::: someone committing crimes of this magnitude. If others from CU were also involved in or aided and abetted the violent attack on the members of Congress::: voting process and Capitol; they too should be immediately dismissed. The coup efforts are on-going and CU should not support further crimes by John Eastman by giving him a lectern from which to further incite violence or knowingly disperse fraudulent information.,Why does CU need to make a comment? Who does an education have to do with what‚Äôs going on? Probably better to stay silent.,Though I disagree with your decision not to dismiss Eastman early::: I realize it is probably a money driven decision. The resulting costs from the lawsuit he would undoubtedly file are probably not worth the early dismissal. Guess the reputational hit and lost future donations are a worthwhile tradeoff.,Please bring the students back ! And also reconsider your decision to cancel graduation If you believe in democracy allow the students / families that want to participate do so All others can stay away Give us a choice !!!,As a Boulder resident and parent of CU students::: if you have a problem with the Chancellor‚Äôs statement - maybe this University is not a good fit for your family. Especially if your goal is to come to this city to invoke your insane violence.,Well I appreciate your condemnation of Eastman and the other seditious participants,This beyond disappointing choice to characterize a faculty member‚Äôs participation in a treasonous coup attempt as protected first amendment speech lacks much needed critical analysis for our era. His behavior goes beyond even shouting ‚Äúfire‚Äù in a crowded movie theater‚Äîit amounts to calling for civil war in response to democracy. Shameful decision making by my alma mater.,This is pathetic. If he has embarrassed the University and does not reflect its values::: he should be dismissed. This CU Buff will never give the university another dime...,Eastman was inciting a riot not demonstrating free speech. The first amendment continues to be misunderstood.,Advocating violence is illegal. His speech is not protected.,Inciting a riot is not political discourse. It is domestic terrorism. Fire him! As an alumnus and parent of a current student::: CU's lack of action is appalling.,TLDR: I finally listened to our alumni and community and will remove a crackpot who never should have been on our campus in the first place.,I can't think of a single thing that would make CU want to find common cause with facists::: white supremacists::: Christian nationalists::: and insurrectionist s. Phil::: quit fucking the dog and dismiss this gaslighting fascist.,"Are you SERIOUSLY going to claim that your contracts do not contain a ""morals clause""? Or::: has Eastman already threatened you with litigation if any action is taken? If so::: let the seditionist go::: and then let him sue you. It would be interesting to see him argue in court::: that the violent overthrow of our government::: or participating in an attempt to have election officials throw out valid votes...isn't morally repugnant.","Mr. DiStefano::: we don't have a set of shared values in this country::: nor have we for a long time. That's the problem. Tell me::: what shared values does John Eastman have with the leaders of Black Lives Matter::: you know::: the Marxists that you invited to speak at your university? Enlighten me sir. Shared values? That's laughable! Additionally::: asking for an investigation into voter fraud isn't buying into a ""conspiracy theory"" as you label it. It's being diligent and thorough::: and ensuring that we had a fair election. People are losing faith that we have a trustworthy voting process in this country::: and an investigation into voter fraud would prove or disprove that we do. People have every right to ask questions::: something that you should endorse::: not degrade::: especially from students that I want to think critically from your institution. You want to talk about ""disregard for the law and the Constitution"" as you put it? How about the laws and state constitutions that are very specific about how elections should be conducted? This election was an embarrassment to that process. Here is a clip of John Eastman speaking the other day::: you can make up your own mind about how ""repugnant"" his speech was: https:// www.youtube.com/ watch?v=FmNOMaNn b6Q",Time for diStefano to go ... he has a University to run::: has no business entering the political fray  https:// www.dailycamera. com/2021/01/07/ phil-distefano-c ondemns-john-ea stman-election- fraud-comments,Not sure if I missed any posts? But did you post anything condemning antifa or blm protests? Just want to be FAIR ?,Not protected by free speech. He advocated sedition. And niether you or Kennedy mention Trump.,You know::: it's funny... I don't recall the university asking for the options of fascism apologists...,Thanks for standing up and saying what is right!!,I attended CU in the mid-60s When the SDS ran the Campus! 100% üí©,All 3 branches of Federal government & journalism on media outlets. There horrendous failures are to blame for Capitol protests & dying USA‚ùóÔ∏è  Patriots Fighting against the following.  My opinion: (1) Federal government. 3 branches are destructive. - national debt - ACA ruined my medical insurance for 3 years - Immigration allows illegals into USA with access to US citizen rights - Congress forced term limits & mandatory retirement at age 65. I‚Äôd add SCOTUS & POTUS. - Federal government is too large & exceed their mandate controlling citizens (2) Democrat Party since POTUS Carter. Moved platform to extreme left. Members in Congress with socialist & communist ideology. Their 2020 platform is posted. It is horrible & socialist. (3) Freedom of speech is being systematically removed. Social media is preventing free speech even for POTUS. (4) Propaganda. The media has removed all ‚Äúfactual‚Äù journalism. Wealthy & corporations controlling ‚Äúfalse‚Äù spins. CNN was despicable last night‚ùóÔ∏è,Very well said. Thank you,Bring the students back.,So::: why does CU need to make a comment? Really::: how is the University involved with yesterday? Inquiring minds want to know!,Great Mr Distefano Political violence is never the answer by either side.

Spring semester and commencement updates: Because of current COVID-19 projections nationally and within our state::: the spring 2021 term::: which begins Jan. 14::: will occur remotely for at least the first month.

Not walking across a stupid stage isn't the end of the freaking world and isn't 'ruining their college years.' Let it go.,How could you make this decision during finals!! And way to soon to call this without any creative planning! Not smart,My daughter was supposed to have a graduation in May 2020. Such a sad thing for all their hard work. No celebration. We were told to come back for this years but it‚Äôs not happening either. Thoughts to everyone as we know how much of a big deal this milestone is and having it taken away.,So disappointing! Couldn‚Äôt each college hold a separate outdoor graduation? These students deserve a proper graduation. Last year‚Äôs online graduation was nothing but pitiful!,Tough choices. We're sad::: but understand the overriding health concerns. Is there a chance the plans may change prior to graduation?,You announce this during finals? Absolutely horrible timing. And too early. So many creative solutions out there. The administration is taking the easy way out. Really disappointed in the leadership and the decisions,"My favorite library with a remarkable saying written above the doors. ""He who knows only his own generation remains always a child.""",Would it be possible to schedule designated travel days in February? Possible but difficult to be in class while travelling across the country.,Timing is everything ... you failed this final CU!,This is disgusting. They are in FINALS right now! Inconsiderate::: thoughtless::: selfish and disappointing to say the least.,I don‚Äôt know what you accomplish in kicking the can::: the math doesn‚Äôt change between January and February::: all the problems will remain. The losers are the students who could get as good or better designed online education from Khan Academy for free The ROI on this decision is silly.,How do they know things won't change by May...this is ridiculous. Stop paying the high tuition for no services rendered.....th ese young adults have worked so hard and through so many things...too soon to make that decision...just lazy money grabbing universities.,How unthoughtful to publish this during finals!,Really disappointed with the graduation announcement::: my Senior was really hoping that at least her smaller major graduation.,This is absolutely ridiculous and the timing couldn't be worse. How do you tell these kids graduation is canceled during finals week and at the holidays. You should be ashamed. This has been going on for a year and you couldn't come up with a better plan. It seem to me that you could have taken a little more time and see how vaccines go before making this decision. You have our 4 years worth of tuition and I guess that is what really matters. DO BETTER THESE KIDS DESERVE MORE.,Man::: CU totally ‚Äúcares about their students:::‚Äù announcing this to us in the middle of finals week::: as if that isn‚Äôt stressful enough. üôÉ Guess those two wellness days will really do us some good!  Disappointed in CU::: the ‚Äúteaching‚Äù that‚Äôs (not) happening::: the administration::: and regret choosing this program over other top programs in the country.,CU doesn't care about the students::: they care about their bank account.,it's official::: you have lost sight of your mission and are overly swayed by non-factual liberal fears,All the money we spent sending r daughter to CU her graduation in winter ceremony meant so much to us in 2015 in basketball stadium small and perfect I feel so bad to all these families do it later,So::: you want us to believe that you are some sort of top notch::: innovative university that is worth approx $60k a year (for those of us out-of-state)::: but you can't figure out how to give our kids a couple of in-person classes and you can't figure out how to have an outdoor graduation ceremony in a stadium that seats 50:::000 plus people in SIX months??? Sure feels like we've been scammed!,Due to the none stop of the pandemic of covid 19 in USA. It is worst compare to Thailand::: we in Thailand has always been protecting our self by wearing mass always and it's opposite in USA where people always argue and continue to not wear mass. This is why we can't see the light at the tunnel end. There are many people at the Thai border are trying to come in Thailand bringing new covid case. They still trying to travel around sine they get in::: argue and escape the guaranteen state. This is a funny world.,Poor leadership CU. This is way too early to determine this now and another major blow to your seniors. Virtual classes since last March and now this. School districts and universities have been able to creatively and safely provide in person graduations by limiting spectators::: live-streaming in person ceremonies with graduates in attendance::: etc. This seems to be taking the easy way out. Unbelievably disappointing with the CU experience for my senior.,As a CU alum this is beyond disappointing! It‚Äôs way too early to make a call like this::: and what terrible timing! My daughter is a 2020 graduate of UGA and they held a socially distanced ceremony at Sanford stadium in October::: if they can figure it out and still stay safe at the height of this pandemic::: the university of Colorado can certainly arrange something and pull off an appropriate celebration six months from now!,Too early to determine graduation! Takes away hope and motivation to announce so soonüòî,The timing of this is so awful! Kids are literally studying for Finals and you hit them with this news?!?! Why are you jumping the gun on a virtual graduation that is 6 months away! It‚Äôs not fair to the seniors!,This is ridiculous! How can you be making decisions for something that is months away?? This is disappointing and hoping that the leaders will think about revisiting this very important topic!,I‚Äôm a CU alum and this is embarrassing. If I were in college::: I‚Äôd be taking some time off!,Hello! I‚Äôm confused on how you guys plan to resume in person classes? What about us students who stayed home for first semester and don‚Äôt have leases in Boulder? How can we do in person classes when we‚Äôre not in Boulder? Will professors be doing both online and in person? It‚Äôs inconsiderate of you to assume students can drop everything and find housing at this point,Should we wear a mask during our virtual graduation ?,Many schools were able to figure out a way to celebrate graduation this summer. There should be plenty of time to come up with a reasonable plan 6 months from now!!! Separate the groups into the individual colleges and stager the ceremonies!!!!,Virtual commencement. This is a complete disappointment and it seems extremely early to make this decision. There are certainly ways to think out of the box and handle this creatively without canceling it. Take a look at some other universities - there are options. Also ::: seriously announcing this during finals?,My child‚Äôs professors don‚Äôt talk to their students. I‚Äôm paying top dollar for my child to be taught by TAs.,What if you took the money it would cost to put on a typical in person commencement ceremony and divide it equally amongst the graduates? A nice check to start their lives in this struggling economy would soften the disappointment of not getting to walk.,Really no reason to pay you til then,This is ridiculous! So much lack of effort from CU leadership. I want to remind CU and students and parents of www.toomuchtuit ioncu.com - The campaign is not over.,Understandable. Although you need to seriously consider a refund on tuition.,A bummer::: but completely understand. Thank you for the update.,Bad timing. Students should be focused on finals and finishing this semester. Couldn't you have waited a few more days?,Taking graduation away AGAIN. I hate this school. Wish I never came.,Does CU just not understand the impact their decisions and timing is having on the students? or do they just not give a crap?,How far up your asses do your heads have to be to make this announcement during finals week? Couldn't wait 3 fucking days to make an announcement about something that is 5 months in the future. Your administration is so far removed from the wellbeing of students its fucking dumbfounding.,So are we forgetting about the class of 2020 or are we all showing up in 2022? Andrew Carver,Super super disappointed in this decision coming right before finals in the holidays in the whole world is talking about getting a vaccination. It was just easier for you guys to cancel it then to try to put any effort into figuring out how it would work or taking a little bit more time to look at it. Glad that my kid is graduating and he‚Äôs out of there,Who is making these decisions so early? Very disappointed for the kids and families that have been denied celebating such a milestone esp 2 years in a row. Figure something out like other schools and stop giving excuses!,So we send you 100k a year??? You cancel the walk????? Why don‚Äôt you put someone busy in charge? #lazy,You couldn't' hold off until finals were over? You thought it was a brilliant idea to add additional stress during finals? You have supposedly world-class experts and professors that are teaching the youth (for an exorbitant price) to lead and problem-solve.. . yet this is the best answer you can come up with? CU you are failing your students::: your alumni and your future.,No alumni money from me this year... the University has had plenty of time to plan for this.,Crappy timing!! What the Heck! You couldn't have waited a few days till finals were over!!,Announcement could have waited until their finals were over. This caused such unnecessary stress during a time when your students needed to be laser focused today::: tomorrow and Saturday for their exams. It wouldn‚Äôt have changed a thing but saved them a HUGE distraction- especially those in leadership positions at Greek houses that needed to shift their attention to handle your announcement.,Why the hell are people overpaying for this product if you are not having the in person community. Collecting the same in fees makes literally no sense when your costs to provide the same level of service are way down.,I have two kids wanting to quit. Figure out an alternative,Well this was a flat out pathetic and poorly timed post. Can you delete? Pretend it was a bad joke?,I'm thankful my daughter is back on campus ::: since August @ Marquette.,Would your psychology professors support the timing of this announcement? Or are they just there for another degree offering to students and you just don't consult them?,Reasons why people are triggered:  1) Money 2) Anti-Liberal Politics 3) Not believing COVID exists 4) Timing  The only legitimate argument is the first one about having to pay top dollar for distance learning. It sucks::: not much you can do about it but the Degree holds the same value. Life skills are learned on the job::: not at school. Tuition is overpriced in person or not.  The rest are people just projecting...  Don‚Äôt like liberals? Not CU‚Äôs fault.  You think COVID is a hoax? Ridiculous::: but also not CU‚Äôs fault.  Timing? When is timing for hearing bad news ever good? Yes::: it‚Äôs CU‚Äôs fault for giving bad news as they are the ones who gave it. However::: you‚Äôd be just as mad today as you would be a week or month from now.  Problems in life happen. Take them in stride as they arise::: that will be the best lesson for these students. Control your emotions::: and don‚Äôt lose it every time something inconvenient happens. The students will get through this::: the parents will get through this::: and everyone will get through this.,so no dorms till Feb 14 ?,Which of the vaccines has been shown to prevent infection? Transmission?,Our high schools did a drive through ceremony and an online speech for each teacher::: dept head and such.,No one needs to know this right now!!,Great timing on this announcement. ü•∫,Yeah let's keep charging regular tuition too!,Zoom graduation pt 2,So since it arguably costs less to administer online courses::: does this mean the university will discount tuition accordingly?...,Absurd. With all your resources::: the University collectively can‚Äôt figure out a plan to stagger::: social distance and safely let the graduates walk across a stage. Rather than finding a creative solution::: 6 months out you simply fold. Furious as an alum and a parent of a CU senior. Also the parent of a freshman at CU::: of which I‚Äôm beginning to regret our choosing.,As a former proud alum I feel the need to reach out and help. I‚Äôm not a professional Marketing expert::: but it appears CU could may need help in the near future attracting and retaining students. CU has accumulated quite the accomplishments in 2020. CU should definitely make these a priority in your future marketing. These are just rough ideas::: but if you can capture the essence of them and get the ideas across to your prospective students and parents::: it would be::: quite frankly::: awesome. ‚Ä¢ First to cancel spring graduation! o We had 5 months to figure something out::: but we wanted the facilities available to rent. o Think of all the time and money the university will save by not putting chairs 6 feet apart in the stadium!  ‚Ä¢ First to shut down campus in Colorado! o Sure CSU right up the road can have in person classes::: thanksgiving break::: classes after thanksgiving break and the same Covid rates. But hey::: we are first in panic and knee jerk reactions. o You don‚Äôt want to spend time with all your new friends anytime. o Studying at home is what you know best anyway. ÔÇß It‚Äôs like high school::: but with zoom! ÔÇß All those classrooms::: libraries and laboratories are just overrated anyway.  ‚Ä¢ First to Cancel Spring break! o We‚Äôll give you two days off to do homework. o You don‚Äôt need a real break like all the other colleges.  ‚Ä¢ #1 in putting students last !  ‚Ä¢ A national leader in creating undue student stress o Making students live in fear of expulsion and fines o Being treated like inmates by Resident Advisors ÔÇß Hourly suicide checks. ÔÇß Isolation and depression included free of charge! ‚Ä¢ Additional healthcare fees may apply. o Being ignored by TA‚Äôs and professors o Making young women walk across campus at night::: alone! ÔÇß Creating the opportunity to confront drug addicts and sexual offenders by yourself.  ‚Ä¢ Our scheduling advisors will put you in the wrong classes to nullify your AP credits. o This will allow you to pay full tuition for something you already know! o They will help you find a lab that is 2 days before you have the lecture to go over what‚Äôs in the lab. ÔÇß Your grades will suffer::: but if you fail::: you can take it over. ÔÇß Our goal is to keep your tuition flowing into our coffers as long as possible.  ‚Ä¢ Our goal is to reduce the college experience once short-sighted policy at a time.  ‚Ä¢ CU Where tenure and tuition come first! o Then once we have it::: we‚Äôll change what we want.  ‚Ä¢ We may not provide enough food in the dorms::: but at least it‚Äôs consistently terrible. o Our daily menu is restricted to 4 items to provide cost savings to the university. o An overpriced market is located conveniently to campus to provide your dietary NEEDS. ÔÇß We know you already paid for it. Just think of it as an opportunity to support the local community who despises you. And so you know CU also fully stands by the local community and will do whatever they want.  I know the above list is short and doesn‚Äôt come close to what you have accomplished. As a previously-prou d alum I realize your resources are limited. I‚Äôm available for additional marketing help if needed. Can we agree on an hourly rate you seem to be comfortable with? What is the cost of a credit hour? I think that will do fine.,https:// covid.colostate. edu/ They seem to be much more reasonable than CU in handling this. They came back after Thanksgiving. Returning for spring semester on time. In person classes and labs. And apparently they haven't canceled graduation that's 5 months away.

When I look back on 2020::: I‚Äôll reflect on the hardships::: but also on the resiliency of all of you and our great institution. I‚Äôll always remember the strengthened fabric of our community and carry with me the lessons learned to benefit today‚Äôs and tomorrow‚Äôs Buffs.

I cherish my liberal arts education from CU üñ§üíõ,Brock Brown over in geography was the most amazing::: inspiring teacher. I took his intro to geography class first semester freshman year. Two weeks after that first day of class::: I changed my major to geography thanks to him.,Bob Pois from the history department Taught and amazing class on Nazi Germany. It was a difficult class to get into because so many students wanted to take it. I used to love talking with him during office hours back in 1993.,"I took ""US History since 1865"" back in 1991. The professor was Michael Mann::: I think. He was the first educator to ever challenge the status quo positions from education and make me really look at political history with a critical eye. He opened my eyes to just how awful FDR was::: and that the policies of Nixon were actually really good for the country. And many other things. His class forever changed me::: and made me a better::: smarter person.",Congratulations all,Dr Elisa Facio was my amazing advisor and professor in Ethnic Studies. She & Dr. Salvador Rodr√≠guez Pino are the reason I now teach Chicana/o Studies & introduction to Ethnic Studies! May they both RIP! Hats off to all the educators at the BUENO Center as well- we are awesome! SKO Buffs,"I was a Poli Sci major::: graduating in 1968. The best ever profs I actually took classes from were Richard Wilson::: Constitutional Law::: and John Buechner::: American Foreign Policy. Professor Buechner went on to become Chancellor of CU Denver campus and later President of the University at Boulder. These were two Professors whose teaching methods steered clear of politics of the moment::: focusing instead on the respective roles of the Supreme Court in American government and the role of American foreign policy in shaping economic & political enlightenment in countries around the world. Their teaching ignored the immediacy of the Vietnam War::: the raw wounds of JFK's assassination and the ensuing criticism::: focusing entirely on the roots of the American judicial system and the policies of recent & incipient administrations with respect to foreign governments::: many throwing off the fetters of colonialism and seeking government structure to guide new governments. I don't recall many judgments being passed in any of the classes I had by these two profs::: making for a true academic exercise of their respective coursework. I enjoyed Constitutional Law because of Professor Wilson's class so much that I recently purchased the Sixth Edition of Constitutional Law casebook/ commentary::: now more than twice the size of my '68 text and about 3 lb of Court history. Hope that looking back at deceased professors is also worthy of consideration; both lectured and participated in government at a moment of enormous change in nations and leaders::: and the work these two did have helped me understand the strains and the changes and to discuss intelligently::: rationally::: those changes as well as their causes and direction toward new government forms. I focused::: as both profs did::: on the big picture view as I served in Vietnam and Fort Benning as an Army editor and reporter at the time of the My Lai Massacre::: Jane Fonda's appearance as a model American astride a Russian-made anti-aircraft gun in Hanoi::: internal Army racial tensions and the heroics of those of us in harm's way on behalf of our Country and in service to each other. (A word about the recent passing of W Harold ""Sonny"" Flowers::: a friend in our senior year at CU. Sonny later attended CU Law and practiced in Boulder. Sonny was a Black man committed to making this a better::: more just::: world; I ran into him by chance in Vietnam; we shook hands::: spoke for a few minutes as friends::: then parted. I never saw him again::: but his name has often appeared in the Coloradan in years since. Sic Transit Gloria Mundi. But an exceptional transit it was for Sonny.)",Garrison Roots from Fine Arts.,Beth Osnes is hands down the best professor that I have ever had. Not only did I learn a great deal from her::: but I also gained a great mentor and friend! I am so inspired by her and I completely changed what I wanted to do in life when I started learning from her! Such a beautiful::: strong::: empowering woman‚ù§Ô∏è,I am pleased to see so little masking and distancing... gives me hope for CU.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Building upon lessons from fall::: our spring 2021 semester will start Jan. 14 and deliver a more robust campus experience while continuing to comply with the latest COVID-19 public health guidance.  Read details about the schedule and operational updates at the link below:  COLORADO.EDU From the Provost and COO - Spring semester to start Jan. 14,2020-10-22 16:14:19,Sounds to me like Boulder County is behind this...probably don't want students bringing any COVID19 back after a week off...üò°,The education that the University is providing under these circumstances is hardly equal to the tuition they are charging. Students are sitting at home take sub par instructions with hardly any resources. These students in many cases are literally teaching themselves. This is ridiculous at best!,Wow::: how is this the best solution for breaks during spring semester? Even two days off in a row during that week would be better than random days off early in the semester. The only effect this system will have is for people to stop going to classes at all for the last half of the semester. Real good job with that one CU.,Please consider expanding testing to all students - off and on on campus at least when everyone gets back from winter break.,The narrative - ‚ÄúYou can continue to count on receiving a high-quality education in a beautiful college town::: with housing and dining options and access to COVID-19 testing.‚Äù  The reality - CU has become a bunch of ill - functioning Zoom classes::: originating in a community that punishes 18-22 year olds for being there.,The best thing the school could do is provide lower tuition for students. It‚Äôs not the burden of the students that CU is dealing with its own financial issues (as we all are) - but it is the burden of the school to provide a fair value to what students and their families are paying. If the school can‚Äôt provide that::: they need to compensate for it.  #toomuchtuitionc u  https:// forms.gle/ d5Z4FAMgkUCYchFm 9,"""As part of our efforts to curb the spread of travel-related COVID-19 infections in our community::: the university has made the difficult decision of opting out of scheduling a traditional weeklong spring break in 2021.""  Giving 3 extra days off over winter break and then two random days off 1 in February and 1 in March doesn't exactly count as spring break. Plenty of students will have pre-planned trips. And your basically asking students to push through till finals without a break at all...  http://chng.it/ wn9zB8BTMB",Give the kids a break....just don't let them travel anywhere üòâ,Wonder how many freshman go home and do community College until tuition drops?,‚Äú...we know we won‚Äôt be able to deliver the full::: traditional college experience you want and deserve...‚Äù  Then maybe we shouldn‚Äôt be expected to pay the full::: traditional tuition for something less than we want and deserve.  I know you guys have a law school. Ask them what constitutes fraud.,http://chng.it/ PmVd8dZB let us be heard! Sign/Share and we'll take it to the town hall tomorrow!,So let me get this straight CU. You would like to further control what adults do? The spring break is a great mental escape from a vigorous work load for many students and by not offering this you are further putting students at risk for severe mental issues::: anxiety::: stress::: depression. This is NOT OK. YOU DO NOT HAVE THE STUDENTS BEST INTEREST at the forefront of this ‚Äúpandemic‚Äù. Who‚Äôs paying who here??? We would like some sort of refund for the misleading of a school year because it‚Äôs been nothing but a complete mess while you try and control every move ‚Äúadults‚Äù make. You do not OWN the students.,I'm starting to feel lucky to be part of the class of 2020... for anyone who can::: I would strongly recommend a gap semester. Take some cheaper community college base courses if you're an underclassman or look for internship opportunities if you're an upperclassman. There are many companies offering spring and fall opportunities!,Big Bummer. CU Boulder once again making a very low value decision to help keep the kids excited about going to CU! (in Boulder::: Colorado) Why not just close down and send them all home? No in person learning::: no activities::: no gatherings at all::: no spring break? There isn't much of anything left that separates it from just saying home and being a buff in your pajamas. Bummer for the kids.,I‚Äôm encouraging my son to take community college courses on line while living in boulder. He‚Äôs a sophomore and has a rental lease so I would rather not waste his college funds on a sub par experience. If it‚Äôs a zoom education::: then save the costs until universities are prepared. Thank goodness he‚Äôs an undergraduate. But he will still live and work in boulder::: but take ARAPAHOE Community college pre req courses.,I hope those who feel so passionately about protecting spring break are taking that passion to the polls! Elect someone who can make a national plan to get COVID under control! #leadershipmatte rs2020,your CAPS is going to be overflowed with stressed and burnt out students who need a break. Expecting already anxious students to work through 15 straight weeks of school with no break is absolutely ridiculous. So much for caring for our health üëç,Students are so overwhelmed already. PLEASE give them a mental health break. You don‚Äôt understand how overwhelmed and struggling we are,Love the online classes!,I honestly don‚Äôt understand all the negativity.  The pandemic is a worldwide problem::: for the foreseeable future. If CU is going to even try to offer ANY kind of in-person experience::: it‚Äôs going to come at a cost::: with many restrictions - bringing that many kids together is a huge risk - and they have to be smart::: and mitigate that risk however they can... I agree that having a week long spring break would be wonderful::: but not at all smart and we would likely end up with out of control numbers like those that happened this fall.  Yes::: mental health is important. No::: I‚Äôm not thrilled about paying full tuition. But we have a choice. My son is happy... and after seeing the effect the April lockdown had on him::: I don‚Äôt ever want to see him that way again.  It‚Äôs not perfect::: but it‚Äôs the reality of the current situation and I‚Äôm thankful for the opportunity for my son to live in Boulder.,wow you‚Äôre doing so much for the students. did you know mental health issues are increasing among students because of stuff like this? breaks are implemented to provide a time for students to recover mentally but hey i get it a virus that has a 99.99% survival rate among college aged people is way more important than our mental health. once again thank you CU you truly are doing the most,Bruh y'all literally just cancelled spring break because YOU couldn't figure out how to handle the spread of COVID? Big fucking oof. Pathetic. 0/10.,What the fuck does a ‚Äúrobust campus experience‚Äù mean::: look what you‚Äôve done for thanksgiving what the hell is wrong with you people,We need a break from classes. 5 straight months of classes is horrible and students will perform horribly without a break.,Live look into CU administration making these decisions https:// youtu.be/ wz-PtEJEaqY,Please be transparent on ‚Äúin class‚Äù and ‚Äúvirtual‚Äùclasse s.,Help Students Bring their Spring Break Back! It is vital for mental health! http://chng.it/ CBNVSymLYF,So no all inclusive pass fail. No Spring Break. No sports. Limited in person classes and recreational activities. Where are the concessions to those paying for the university.,Amazing that you were able to assert a point and completely contradict that very point in such a short post.  Shockingly efficient (albeit prospectively tragic) irony::: University of Colorado Boulder.,To the folks wanting reduced tuition::: I don't get it. Yes::: we all are having not great experiences due to life during a pandemic::: but it seems to me it probably costs the University as much or even more to deliver classes::: make modifications to accommodate public health guidance::: etc::: etc. My son is a CU freshman living in Sewall (but moving home) who indeed has had a not great experience. I guess the thing that would be helpful and reasonable to me is if the unused Munch Money and meals could roll over to a later semester.,That is a long and stressful haul without any real down time to recharge. I know why but there needs to be a better solution.,Ask students how their mental health is doing with only 2 days off at thanksgiving and then make a decision. From everyone I‚Äôve talked to::: it‚Äôs not great and students need a break. I am now thoroughly convinced CU does not care about its students and their mental health and needs. Preventing students from seeing their families is so wrong. It is during these times that students need support the most and CU is taking that away.,I want this CU administration to be the pallbearers at my funeral so they can let me down one last time,Need an ultra clean ride to the airport with a professional driver? We are a local car service based in Golden::: accepting new clients.  Airport Transfers Special events Dinner pickup & drop off  Book online www.westwinglim ousine.com or call/text Chris at 608-628-2180 anytime you need to feel classy & safe!,No spring break...I don't think that is a good idea at all. The students can attend class from anywhere in the world::: what would stop them from taking spring break? What a cluster,The burnout from the semester doesn't come in the first 3 days of the classes::: it comes in March/April::: which is the whole point of Spring Break. An extra day off for 2 months doesn't help as much as a longer break::: because we're still going to have to do homework and study during those days off (which are a Wednesday and Thursday??). I understand the need to curb the spread::: but this is just going to further hurt students who are already suffering from online learning. I suspect that attendance will drop to a new low in mid-to-late March.,I am a parent of a CU TA who is working day and night to give students the best he can give under the circumstances. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair to pick on faculty etc as I‚Äôm sure they aren‚Äôt sitting around doing nothing. As for ‚Äúbreaks‚Äù wait until you get a real job with only a week or two vacation off a year ::: plus maybe a few holidays thrown in.,CU staff is doing the best they can. People are dying from Covid. Don't die::: don't be negative or show off your imagined entitlement. Be the generation that helps others and understands the risks. Party later::: but you will learn::: you didn't miss anything.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Every tennis player plays at home and the Nobel Committee decides who is the Best::: without tournament!  Why scientists are not allowed to compete against each other like in tennis::: each with their Discoveries!  The theoretical predictions of the peerless Albert Einstein are Wrong!  What 2020 Physics Nobel Laureates::: Roger Penrose professor Oxford University::: Andrea Ghez professor at UCLA::: teach about Einstein Gravitation theory::: Supermassive Black holes::: Dark Matter is completely wrong...  I discovered in Ferent Quantum Gravity the opposite of what they discovered about Black Holes and Dark Matter:  I discovered that Supermassive Black holes have very Small Mass::: very Small volume::: not Huge Mass and Zero volume! I discovered that Faster Than Light particles are Dark Matter particles!  Newton and Leibnitz discovered the same thing. I discovered the exact opposite of what these Nobel Laureates discovered.

You are the problem until you chose to be strong enough to be the solution!,THIS IS NOT FAIR. Students and parents deserve to pay less when they get less.  Students are missing out on valuable college experiences and opportunities that could build their character::: career and well-being.

Key things to know about the new public health order from Boulder County: 1) We all need to continue to follow county and state COVID-19 public health orders. 2) We need to continue to limit gatherings to no more than two people for 18- to 22-year-olds 3) In-person/hybrid teaching resumes on Wednesday::: 10/14.  Thank you for continuing to do your part to keep each other safe::: Buffs!  COLORADO.EDU Students: What the public health order means for you,2020-10-09 12:16:10,What is in-person/ hybrid teaching? Define please,Absolutely nothing. My life hasn't changed at all since this started. Just harder to find tp and food at the grocery every once in a while,Dear Ole CU RespectU is gone! you had a chance like many other Universities to be part of the solution. You chose to be not only to be part of the problem you are now creating problems for students::: citizens of Boulder and the surrounding area. When the students do return home for a break they will have to quarantine for 2 weeks in some states. CU YOU ARE THE PROBLEM. Greedy at the the cost of people health.,It certainly appears as though CU Boulder couldn‚Äôt care less about their students or public health. They brought them all back to campus to capture that $$$$::: then illegally discriminated against them (18-22 year olds only!?!) and violated their civil rights with Draconian lock down orders. Money is all that matters to them.,The health order means that this school is for pussies,With all due respect::: virtual life continues for the freshmen that are stuck in dorms (per CU Boulder requirements)::: and never had in-person classes to begin with. When the football team resumes practices::: will you PLEASE allow the rest of the student body to enjoy the outdoors and play spike ball or frisbee or club sports or eat together in groups of... I don‚Äôt know... more than 6? Would you consider putting the basketball goals back up on campus on 10/14? There are SO many ways to provide healthy outlets (that are NOT virtual) for the students. Please look around the country and get creative for the sake of the mental/ emotional health of the 18-22 years olds that WERE so excited to join the ‚ÄúBuff Family‚Äù? The students have ‚Äúdone their part‚Äù. Cases have decreased. Please stand up for these students that have stayed on campus and endured this lockdown::: CU Boulder? They do not deserve to be treated like criminals by BCPH any longer.,How can they do in person classes at all if the limit to this age group is 2 people?,You do realize the Covid cases were starting to rise for at risk boulder residents this was well documented and considered where the hotspot was coming from the students who chose not to follow what has helped keep the Covid cases down. No one thinks the students are criminals if they are inconvenienced for a period of time that is part of life. Our veterans who lost their lives::: limbs::: and suffer mental anguish for fighting for our freedom. I think the students will just be fine::: look at as a learning lesson how to prepare for the roller coaster ride called life.,Other than the blatant contradiction of item #3 relative to 1 & 2 (and common sense...and the vast majority of expert recommendations )::: sounds great.  The stubborn myopic plodding of the University of Colorado Boulder is striking.,Oh and health of other students and Boulders population,The Great Barrington Declaration  As infectious disease epidemiologists and public health scientists we have grave concerns about the damaging physical and mental health impacts of the prevailing COVID-19 policies::: and recommend an approach we call Focused Protection.  Coming from both the left and right::: and around the world::: we have devoted our careers to protecting people.  Current lockdown policies are producing devastating effects on short and long-term public health.  The results (to name a few) include lower childhood vaccination rates::: worsening cardiovascular disease outcomes::: fewer cancer screenings and deteriorating mental health ‚Äì leading to greater excess mortality in years to come::: with the working class and younger members of society carrying the heaviest burden.  Keeping students out of school is a grave injustice.  Keeping these measures in place until a vaccine is available will cause irreparable damage::: with the underprivileged disproportionat ely harmed.  Fortunately::: our understanding of the virus is growing. We know that vulnerability to death from COVID-19 is more than a thousand-fold higher in the old and infirm than the young.  Indeed::: for children::: COVID-19 is less dangerous than many other harms::: including influenza.  As immunity builds in the population::: the risk of infection to all ‚Äì including the vulnerable ‚Äì falls.  We know that all populations will eventually reach herd immunity ‚Äì i.e. the point at which the rate of new infections is stable ‚Äì and that this can be assisted by (but is not dependent upon) a vaccine.  Our goal should therefore be to minimize mortality and social harm until we reach herd immunity.  The most compassionate approach that balances the risks and benefits of reaching herd immunity::: is to allow those who are at minimal risk of death to live their lives normally to build up immunity to the virus through natural infection::: while better protecting those who are at highest risk.  We call this Focused Protection.  Adopting measures to protect the vulnerable should be the central aim of public health responses to COVID-19. By way of example::: nursing homes should use staff with acquired immunity and perform frequent PCR testing of other staff and all visitors. Staff rotation should be minimized.  Retired people living at home should have groceries and other essentials delivered to their home. When possible::: they should meet family members outside rather than inside.  A comprehensive and detailed list of measures::: including approaches to multi-generatio nal households::: can be implemented::: and is well within the scope and capability of public health professionals.  Those who are not vulnerable should immediately be allowed to resume life as normal.  Simple hygiene measures::: such as hand washing and staying home when sick should be practiced by everyone to reduce the herd immunity threshold.  Schools and universities should be open for in-person teaching.  Extracurricular activities::: such as sports::: should be resumed.  Young low-risk adults should work normally::: rather than from home.  Restaurants and other businesses should open.  Arts::: music::: sport and other cultural activities should resume.  People who are more at risk may participate if they wish::: while society as a whole enjoys the protection conferred upon the vulnerable by those who have built up herd immunity.  On October 4::: 2020::: this declaration was authored and signed in Great Barrington::: United States::: by:  Dr. Martin Kulldorff::: professor of medicine at Harvard University::: a biostatistician ::: and epidemiologist with expertise in detecting and monitoring of infectious disease outbreaks and vaccine safety evaluations.  Dr. Sunetra Gupta::: professor at Oxford University::: an epidemiologist with expertise in immunology::: vaccine development::: and mathematical modeling of infectious diseases.

Still waiting for the discrimination lawsuits::: or is the CU Boulder population so out of touch with the principles of liberty that they won‚Äôt fight for their rights?  Public health is a major concern::: but locking down healthy people is clearly unconstitutiona l and a violation of civil rights::: then throw in the specific age range of 18-22 year olds only::: and there must be $$$$ waiting for whomever brings the suit.,So disappointed about how you all are handling the kids who are in lock down off campus.

Currently in grad school at Metro and although not being in class sucks::: at least we have stuck with the same safety plan and created a sense of normalcy and stability that way.,I don‚Äôt usually comment on these things but this is just so wrong for these kids!!

Fair weather friend to say the least!,Well at least the football team can gather!üôÑ,I was originally planning on going to see you Boulder. However this outbreak made me decide to cancel go to school this year as much as I wanted to go. I don‚Äôt understand what you were thinking having in person classes. With all the morons throwing parties it‚Äôs spreading this virus this was just in to become a disaster. I do look forward to Cu Boulder recovering From this pandemic. But I told him I stay home.I could lose a few years of school. I refuse to lose my life or my quality of life to a stupid virus. Good luck getting through this year. I hope to be there in the fall of 2021 by then I hope we are well on our way to getting this under control. Until then be safe.,People are acting like this is Ebola!

We all need to be responsible for ourself and others now by being good citizens...GO BUFFSüëç,I‚Äôm a CU alum with 2 current students. How is it that CSU is accomplishing in person low case rates and CU is not? Oh yeah::: they test all students AND provide SAFE in person options so students actually have something to do and some social connection. So disgusted.,I am always supportive of letting science and public health measure lead the way::: yet I am struggling to see the logic in the above plan. Essentially::: nothing will change for students at all until next week.....maybe. Yet::: apparently CU football practice resumes this friday? Our students still cannot sit in groups of 3 under a tree to eat lunch::: even at a distance. They cannot travel in cars with masks on to enjoy safe outdoor hiking locations. This is frustrating. Most CU students have been masking and distancing since the first day of school. How must they feel right now? I would assume unappreciated and concerned for their own mental health and endurance for this process. They see sports getting prioritized::: and it can't make sense to them. Can CU please advocate for these students with Boulder Public Health? It seems the focus of the ordinance is misplaced. Also::: i would encourage CU admin to acknowledge that kids are feeling fatigued by virtual programming::: even though I appreciate the hard work that has gone into creating it. Can the staff please consider maximizing their effort and creativity in order to define what students CAN do as they emerge from this ordinance? Other schools have invested in outdoor firepits::: heating lamps::: chairs::: cornhole::: string lights::: movie screens::: spray painted socially distanced circles on the lawn......do you think there might be some donors who are willing to support an effort like that? please::: please::: let's honor these young adults and their efforts by creating an environment where they can succeed.,Money > Life,Just close for a year. Seems simple to me. The education they‚Äôre getting is trash.,There is no great news in this!! You are the ONLY public large university acting like a small private school. Wondering how many kids you will loose next semester and next year itsreally sad!!!! And I‚Äôm an alumni who gave money,Great news???? I cannot imagine this being done to any other demographic. This is absurd!!!!,So IVY League schools shutter and give a blueprint for 2020-21 nationwide yet at one campus::: Boulder age discrimination happens. Should have known this would be a bad year after a tuition credit was denied 11th hour in August.

Congratulations to CU Boulder alumna Jennifer A. Doudna::: who did her postdoctoral research in the Cech Lab::: for winning the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry!  Correction: In our excitement for Dr. Doudna::: we imprecisely stated she is an alumna of CU Boulder. While Dr. Doudna did research in the Cech Lab from '91-'94::: she did not graduate with a degree from CU. Still::: we're very excited to have played a role in this ex-Cechies' academic journey!  Nobel Prize October 7::: 2020 at 1:48 AM ¬∑  BREAKING NEWS The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences has decided to award the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry to Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer A. Doudna ‚Äúfor the development of a method for genome editing.‚Äù  Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer A. Doudna have discovered one of gene technology‚Äôs sharpest tools: the CRISPR/Cas9 genetic scissors. Using these::: researchers can change the DNA of animals::: plants and microorganisms with extremely high precision. This technology has had a revolutionary impact on the life sciences::: is contributing to new cancer therapies and may make the dream of curing inherited diseases come true.  Researchers need to modify genes in cells if they are to find out about life‚Äôs inner workings. This used to be time-consuming::: difficult and sometimes impossible work. Using the CRISPR/Cas9 genetic scissors::: it is now possible to change the code of life over the course of a few weeks.  Since Charpentier and Doudna discovered the CRISPR/Cas9 genetic scissors in 2012 their use has exploded. This tool has contributed to many important discoveries in basic research::: and plant researchers have been able to develop crops that withstand mould::: pests and drought. In medicine::: clinical trials of new cancer therapies are underway::: and the dream of being able to cure inherited diseases is about to come true. These genetic scissors have taken the life sciences into a new epoch and::: in many ways::: are bringing the greatest benefit to humankind.

The University of Colorado Boulder strongly opposes proposed changes to the longstanding ‚Äúduration of status policy‚Äù announced Sept. 25 by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.  If implemented::: the rule would place restrictive new time limits on international students::: postdoctoral scholars::: researchers::: instructors and their dependents who are in the United States pursuing their academic goals.

Listen Learn THINK Fix it,I like the new policy.,How about you start with being strongly opposed to Boulder County Public Health and their outrageous and draconian restrictions on your students today. You are losing students daily because of the hostile environment in the dorms and on campus. There is a mass exodus from the dorms and a growing resentment by the students and parents. Please look at the other schools in the nation and see why you are failing. The overwhelming evidence is that this virus is not sending students to the hospital or causing death. Students are paying for IN-PERSON instruction and the CAMPUS EXPERIENCE. If you continue this path of kneeling to the Boulder Aristocracy and Health Dept. arbitrary rules which exceed the CDC and WHO guidelines::: you will cause not only a huge loss in this class::: but future students as well.

Proud to be a forever Buff,Well I have now heard from friends and family across the country expressing sadness and outrage at what our students are enduring. Our students should be given more leeway in the city that is their home for 9 months or more. The city of Boulder is not following any reasonable COVID guidelines in regards to people being outside and in masks.

CU Boulder isn‚Äôt alone: Across the country::: many universities have seen similar spikes in COVID-19 cases. At the same time::: some experts also see glimmers of hope in the stories of other schools::: such as the University of Notre Dame::: that seem to have slowed outbreaks by pausing in-person learning.  At CU Boulder::: campus leaders are cautiously optimistic that the transition to online-only classes::: along with the public health order::: will help bend the university‚Äôs curve‚Äîlowering infection rates so that Buffs can again sit in the same rooms as their instructors and classmates.  Read more about how temporary shutdowns have helped other universities and what we're doing at CU Boulder by clicking the link below.  COLORADO.EDU Some universities show early signs of slowing COVID-19 outbreaks through temporary shutdowns,2020-09-30 12:41:05,It would be great if the University would sanction club events on campus and some small group activities. According to the mandate::: if its sanctioned by the school it‚Äôs ok. Do right by your students. Reinstate some outdoor activities. Make them wear masks. But give the kids some socialization and fresh air. Small book discussions::: small exercise classes::: etc would go a long way.,Not one community banned its kids ages 18-22 from the town or mandated groups of one or two outside. I‚Äôm glad Boulder changed to at least make kids be in pairs::: but they are still alone and draconian in the rules for our kids who live there.,Now that they COVID numbers are starting a downward trend::: I hope that CU is using this time while our kids are locked up to come up with a reasonable plan. Please DO NOT let the City of Boulder extend this order! Do the right thing for your students and fight for them. This is so wrong.,CU is one of the few that didn‚Äôt offer any support to students though. They paused in person learning but allowed students to cancel rent. We‚Äôre still paying rent while they‚Äôll still be for most of the year learning remotely,Maybe the classes should have just been online this semester to begin with. Opening campus was not smart. Hopefully things will work out for spring semester::: but i predict most students will opt to stay home and finish the year online. What a sad way to go::: but weve got to stay safe!,Yeah the 99.9% survival rate is worrisome for these young adults,According to the Brown University study of 37 universities. Spike in infection rate produced two hospitalization s and zero deaths. Isn‚Äôt this a good thing. The virus takes its course and the collective immune system of the young and healthy are protecting the frail and aged?,CU - Keep trying to tell yourselves that your acceptance of age discrimination is okay. The longer you play this charade the more people will turn on you. Admit you made a horrible mistake.,I am bringing my Freshman daughter and her roommate plus maybe another dorm mate to Colorado Springs for the weekend where they can hike::: exercise::: eat at an outside cafe and be on a 3 day parole from the unbelievable situation in Boulder. YES::: I did make sure it was ok and approved.,Yes::: but no other city has issued such draconian measures that target the collegiate population. Boulder obviously cares more in protecting their precious homeless population that preys upon the student population. You would be better off cleaning up the city of your bums than ridding your city of college students.,It is true that many other universities have seen spikes and have moved to a two week stay at home order to stop the spread. But nowhere has the community targeted 18-22 year olds with such extreme tactics. Kids are scared to leave their room as Police are stopping people and threatening tickets and fines if they are talking to another student with masks on. The county is discriminating against a certain age population which is horrible. If the county is so worried about numbers maybe they should shut down Pearl street which is crowded with ALL AGES every weekend.,Easy to cancel school after having received un-refundable tuition,So are you going to remain online only beyond the two weeks which began on September 23?,So if your friend jumps off the cliff you would too???,Thank you CU::: keep protecting our buffs!!!,This year has made me thankful my daughter chose a different school,Suicide is the leading cause of death among Colorado youth between the ages of 10 and 24.

She wanted this university so badly and we gave in and agreed. We live out of country so we can‚Äôt even bring her home.,Other Universities are succeeding - BUT no school is targeting an age group. They may have moved to remote and told their students to only go out as necessary. Nonn I‚Äôm other school has used threats police and ticketing students for going to Starbucks. And exercise is encouraged. You have outdoor trails and mountains! Encourage their use! And enact a testing plan. You have none.,https:// youtu.be/ 8UvFhIFzaac,Too broad of an order::: but per my student the specific addresses locked down::: are the source of the problem. Mostly Greeks. The kids that made the whole class lose their recess...,Yes the two week pause would have been fine but u failed our kids by supporting the ridiculous mandate by boulder county that targeted our kids!!! Other colleges also provided their kids ways to socialize and did not lock them away in their dorms and apartments. BIG FAIl CU!!!üò°üò°,No other community specifically targeted 18-22 yr olds the way Boulder has and CU should be ashamed of how they just bent over and did nothing to defend their students. You chose to bring the students back to Boulder and have now hidden or probably worked with them when the city targeted one specific age group because you had no real plan other than making it until tuition payments were made.,Cases mean crap üí©. Look at the data.,Name ONE School/ community that is discriminating against the age group of 18-22 by threatening jail and/or suspension if they are seen anywhere with more than 1 person?

COLORADO.EDU How to cope with COVID-19: Mental health tips and resources,2020-09-28 16:11:03,So sad to see you punish 18-22 year olds who now fear a fine and punishment if they are seen with even one friend. This seems absolutely like CU is discriminating against this certain age group for what reason? Please copy and paste facts as well as the scientific data that proves these adults are spreading COVID in Boulder.,Suicide is the leading cause of death among Colorado youth between the ages of 10 and 24.

DiStefano::: Chancellor University of Colorado Boulder  Need to explain to the students::: citizens of boulder county how 18-22 can live together in house of 5 or more but not go on a 30 min walk together for fresh air. Also does being 17 or 23 make you magically safer.  It is not safe for students to be traveling alone at night and it‚Äôs also discouraged by the university it‚Äôs self. On their own web page for ‚Äústaying safe‚Äù say to use the buddy system.  What was the bench mark for acceptable case numbers upon return to campus::: if the number was zero that was never going to happen that was unattainable number we where going to fail. So if the intention was to fail and push online. Then why bring everyone back?  The students that YOU are basically making live in their dorm rooms like prisoners in isolation deserve answers.

This notion that sick students will surely infect elderly is not legitimate. No other time in history have we reversed to the thinking. We must return to normal life. The students are paying for an in person education and a campus life. They all know the risks. They accept the risks and choose to pay to be here.

Just read some of the comments from parents! Wow::: and our country with over 200:::000 dead and families without adequate food! Makes me ashamed to be a CU ALUM....,The offer of support services seems sincere::: but why would a student look to the same institution for guidance when that same institution is what is causing the stress? You force isolation and instill fear with little regard to their well being::: and then turn around and offer to help them deal with it.  The solution seems simple. Let them go outside with a roommate. Just one. Give them a little taste of normalcy. Two people that have been living in close quarters for weeks have either both avoided or contracted the virus together. Letting them move as a ‚Äúsingle‚Äù entity poses no more risk than if they walked alone.  You have one of the best medical schools in the country. You have psychology::: math::: statistics departments at your disposal. Are you not consulting them about the mental health risks posed to your students? Are you using the analytical departments to lower the risk with minimal impact on your students? It doesn‚Äôt‚Äô appear so.,Sharing positive idea helps us staying good living in daily life. In Thailand::: we have had a prompt self quarantine. With a good co-operation we have no new case of covid within our country for almost 5 months. Your future is upon your mind set.,What about those students to live in their own apartment without a roommate. Have you even considered that. This is disgusting. How can you target a specific age group it's like targeting a gender or race.,What a shame this all is! My daughter is a freshman::: we are paying for out of state tuition::: a meal plan she does not use and room and board she is not living in. She is HOME because being on campus is horribly uncomfortable. From what I understand the students are leaving campus and going to their hometowns::: where they are not fined or ostracized for walking to Starbucks with their room mate. So how do you see this as a resolution CU? The isolation is taking a dozen steps back. And in the meantime the students are getting robbed of the college experience and us parents are getting robbed having to pay FULL price for it all. What a shame!!!,I would say it‚Äôs absolutely necessary for my kid to go to the store for groceries and it is safer for the city residents if she drives there with a friend rather than get on a city bus. Get it together. This one person nonsense has got to end today.,Why don't you start paying attention to scientific facts::: like the CDC just saying that less than 1% of people over 70 died of Corona which is the high number. So use some common sense::: this isn't a pandemic it's a hysteria,Maybe::: instead of continually posting explanations and defenses to the PHO::: CU could direct that energy into working with Boulder County to actually advocate for their students. Advocate for a more realistic solution that doesn‚Äôt discriminate and criminalize. It‚Äôs ridiculous that my son can‚Äôt drive his roommate to get a flu shot. Because the health of everyone else in the county matters::: as long as you‚Äôre not 18-22 years old. And it‚Äôs ridiculous that my son is supposed to now be wearing a mask inside his residence among roommates he‚Äôs already been living with for months. I could go on::: but It‚Äôs evident by these postings that CU is already aware of the insanity of this mandate. These off-campus students probably pay more to reside in Boulder right now than many of the long-time residents. They are a legitimate source of city and county revenue. I‚Äôve been in Boulder multiple times over the past couple of months::: and I‚Äôve rarely seen anyone even walking outside without a mask. I even asked my son if we had to wear masks outside in Boulder. An extreme government overreach to a new crop of voters. I doubt Boulder wants to see these kids swing right::: but it could be a possibility now. These kids have been continually encouraged to get tested by CU and the County::: and now they are being punished for it. Not so different than the bait-and-switch of hybrid course offerings before they all decided to move back to Boulder::: only to be all online from the start. I really hope CU steps up before spring semester::: and works with supporting their students to keep them there over the next few years. I don‚Äôt want to see CU‚Äôs numbers drop or their reputation change. It‚Äôs clear that Boulder does not want these students there.,One wonders whether a bench filled with football players will be in compliance ...,This is age discrimination! Disgusting! Where is the ACLU! I hope there is a class action suit for anyone getting falsely fined and or prosecuted for responsibly doing what is their constitutional right. Shame on you Boulder!,"I believe CU and Boulder County are getting exactly what they want. By making conditions of living and attending CU so isolating and abhorrent::: students are leaving the city and going back to their hometowns. CU gets to pad its bank account with tuition::: room and board (and all the other services we are paying for but don't have access to) and ""stand proud"" that they left campus ""open:::"" while citing that students left of their own accord. In essence::: forcing them away without admitting this is the plan. My daughter is a junior at CU and what is being done there is a gross injustice.",The issue is Boulder County Health and CU are not following CDC guidelines. Also not using common sense - roommates can be inside together but not outside together masked. This goes against the science and cdc guidelines. If you at all monitor public health directives around the country and other college towns you‚Äôll see that this one by BCPH is the most restrictive in the country you‚Äôll also see that public health directives even less restrictive than this have been challenged and a US Court of Appeals has said that a public health entities ability to enact directives like this are in fact not unfettered in times of global health crisis that their are limits on this. CU has caved to the BCPH and in doing so in the short term it has harmed not only it‚Äôs students but it‚Äôs university as more students pull out more faculty and staff jobs will be cut::: the variety of courses offered will be cut and in the long term the reputation of the school and how it handled this particular situation regarding rising numbers and not standing up to BCPH. While I commend CU for having one of the best if not the best testing policy in country::: I believe there was a more science based approach to the rising numbers like placing a curfew on dorm students and hill students and limiting gatherings to two to three students. CU even went against science by canceling it‚Äôs in person classes when according to their own contact tracers their have been no covid transmissions from in person learning. As a research university CU should be following the science and the CDC guidelines period.,It‚Äôs Boulder. I wouldn‚Äôt expect anything less of them. They love to tell other people how to think & live. Primarily because they truly believe their perspective is superior to all others. If you want to live in a monolithic intolerant society::: move to Boulder.,It's interesting that it seems to just be parents whining on this post. Instead of being helicopter parents::: maybe you just take your own advice::: let your kids act like adults::: and I'm guessing that if you've actually raised your kids to be empathetic::: they'll do the right thing here.,Is there any material difference in risk::: to anyone::: between a single student wearing a mask and keeping 6 feet away from others::: and two roommates walking together? The roommates share a room::: snacks::: bathrooms adhering to all the same rules. I am not advocating for groups larger than two. My student is feeling imprisoned. Her guard/RA checks her room multiple times a day. She is afraid to go outside in case another student walks too close::: or stops to say hi. Unless there is a significant increase in risk::: you are causing more problems than you are solving. I understand it would may be harder to enforce. I mean having to count to 2 instead of 1 is extremely difficult.,Will families be receiving a credit or refund in the tuition because they cannot use the bus services?I tried contacting the acting director. The bus memo is craft fully worded. No funny jokes please.,Masks when outside you gotta be kidding me,If it‚Äôs really that serious::: how is anyone alive in cities with fewer restrictions?,Cu is turning into a joke,...but it‚Äôs illegal to take the bus under your health order,Hilarious one sided perspective.,Reading the actuarial reports of 60-70% reduction in required reserves for Covid 19 Life insurance early death payouts is sobering. While the town is in mass Hysteria-on-the -Hill those mainly dying outside OAP homes are poor with low insurance. Often these are minorities who of course are disproportionat ely poor in this country. The issue of course is long-term health conditions often associated with poverty. All the screeching about wearing masks is fine by all (just common sense) but by failing to address the fundamentals of poverty as a cause death and illness the numbers will only change slowly while we burn the economy and kids lives. We will say cancers go up because of screening delays. Actuaries are brutal people to spend time with because they price death for the insurance market. On this Covid they are worth listening to. The rest of it is just flapping about.  If we assume death risk-pricers know what they are doing we should be targeting the vaccine to those most vulnerable AND aggressively promoting health in those groups as the overriding priority. I imagine the cost to the economy could have paid for this many times over.  One might also imagine that the loss of elders and social cohesion in those groups is a contributor to despair on the streets. Triage in those groups will surely be the best $$$ spent long term.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Not sure what to do? You can eat::: exercise or study outside if you are by yourself::: which isn‚Äôt so bad on a campus like ours‚Äîbut please wear a mask and keep your physical distance in common spaces::: including residence hall lounges::: lobbies::: and rec fields.  Learn more about what the public health order means to you to help plan your day ‚û° https://bit.ly/338CecM,2020-09-27 14:30:19,This post is the sound a sheep makes. I would expect at an institution of higher learning to have more insightful guidance.,#protecttheherd???? How about you start with not requiring students to be alone! Allow two students to walk through campus together!,Can‚Äôt wait for next week when they send in the military for mandatory martial law,You guys::: just like every other university demanding on campus living::: are a joke and dis grace to the health of your campus. You care more about tuition and residential income than the safety of the students. Just another reason why the US college institution is so fucked up. More debt and sickness here we come.,This is REALLY tone deaf - do you have a social media/Comms team to plan messaging with?,CU need to take care of their students and stop asking them to isolate themselves. It must be allowed to be 2 together::: especially if they are wearing a mask. Come on! CU have to understand the consequences that these enforcements and threats can have on students‚Äô mental health. You have to work with them to solve this situation::: not just enforce restrictions that make no sense and which can actually be harmful for them in the long run.,This is absolutely not the way for the University to handle this pandemic. Horrible. Has anyone from the administration thought about the long-term mental health problems these kids are going to have as a result of this forced isolation?,Or how about with a buddy which is safer. Let‚Äôs look out for our kids physical and mental welfare. This is irresponsible.,Reminder: Assaults::: rape::: and abductions can happen during the day not just at night. Amend the policy and allow students to pair up for safety when out for essential activities.,"This wouldn't be necessary but for gross irresponsibilit y at the start of the semester. As a parent of a student who did not ""party on the Hill""::: these measures are long overdue. The lack of responsibility and compassion for others you might impact had serious consequences. I want my daughter to be safe and the childish behavior of some students jeopardized her safety. Irresponsible behavior can have dire consequences. Be happy 3 weeks of self-quarantine and no parties is as bad as it gets!",Am I missing something here? Why is everyone ripping CU? The restrictions everyone is complaining about have been imposed by local government per a public health order. It's not from the University. It is being targeted at the University.,When you are outside alone you üëèüèΩ don‚Äôt üëèüèΩ need üëèüèΩ to üëèüèΩ wear üëèüèΩ a üëèüèΩ mask üëèüèΩ. It‚Äôs the same thing as driving alone wearing your mask with your windows up. Super weirddddt.,"I don't think it matters how bad the virus is in regards done to the wrong students recently. The problem about these restrictions is that Boulder and CU knew that the return of hundreds of students could cause numbers to go up::: yet they allowed all of the students to return to the dorms::: took their money::: and as it was pointed out to me::: decided to enact this new mandate the day after the refund deadline ended. The virus can be deadly to the community and to the students::: yes::: but this is more about fraud than anything else. They should have been clear about what the environment was going to look like from the very beginning. If Boulder was as worried as they are now about the virus numbers going up::: they should just have done all online for at least the semester. Can you imagine paying full tuition (20k to 50k) to ""have the college experience"" and then being forced to be a prisoner in your own home? Complete and utter fraud in my opinion. I am a CU alum and I currently feel ashamed of CU and Boulder for doing this to them. By the way::: I do think the large parties shouldn't be allowed to happen::: but walking in two's not being allowed? Come on. It is ridiculous and it is fraud.","CU: ""Come on back to Boulder 30 thousand students::: we'll make sure it's fine! We promise this isn't about your tuition revenues!"" Also CU: ""STUDENTS HOW COULD YOU BE SO IRRESPONSIBLE?""",Sitting there alone starving her brain of clean o2..,Why is someone who is lying by herself wearing a mask?? You should really remove this post.,Shame on you::: CU. This has simply gone too far and the risks officially outweigh the benefits of a lockdown this stringent... as an alumni::: I‚Äôm disappointed. You can‚Äôt even sit with an adult who happens to be a family member outside??? Are you kidding me?,Nuts. Kids don‚Äôt need to wear a mask by themselves outside. Get real.,How is requiring college students to walk alone through campus safe? Students should be allowed to walk in pairs::: especially females! Please rethink this for the safety of your students. I teach elementary and we allow kids to walk together in small groups.,I hate masks. But what I hate more is that there seems to be no end in sight to this.,Not sure what to do? Attend school from home (not Boulder) until the administrators at the school learn some simple risk/reward on their terrible decisions. Maybe they‚Äôll learn some ethics too on their money grab.,University of Indiana has double plus the cases of boulder and still functioning under normal Covid style.,I would let the students live totally normally with reminders about washing hands only. These rules do nothing for virus transmission::: but can be quite detrimental for mental health.,My student and I always talk about whether she would rather do you online instruction here from home. I think having the option of staying or coming home has helped through this. For now she and her roommate are doing splendidly. But I think I‚Äôll have a rule about coming home once a semester to stay. It‚Äôs getting expensive. We‚Äôre OOS.,University of Colorado Boulder should respond.......,I don't always agree with my alma mater::: but on this I'm more than content to hear they're taking care.,I hope everyone who is unhappy with the new guidelines is reaching out to all the departments and all of the administrators who could be part of the change to reverse these discriminatory mandates.,My daughter was in her hammock 8 feet apart from her friend and got talked by a cop who took note of her student ID because she was outside! While someone with Covid on her floor came back after only 8 days!,Just wear the mask .... It's that simple üëç.,I am more and more embarrassed to be an alum of CU....üò¢,Ugh wearing a mask when you‚Äôre by yourself !!!! Nobody near you stop drinking the kool aidü§£,Um::: they are living together in student housing and they can‚Äôt sit together outside? This is madness. My son goes to SMU and they are doing fine with common sense measures in place (masks::: hybrid schedules of in person and online learning::: limited numbers on gatherings::: no parties). If there is an outbreak in a residence::: the students in that residence are quarantined. If there is a student who has already had the virus::: that student is free to come and go. I was considering CU Boulder for my graduating senior but I am having trouble with the draconian approach to this.,Are we at all concerned with the mental health of students? It seems as we are hearing more and more (on the east coast) about rises in suicide and drug/alcohol abuse are a far greater risk to our kids than COVID. Are the CU decision makers taking that the account? It worries me for my loved ones there :(,CU has lost its mind. Don‚Äôt try to sell this nonsense as necessary or reasonable. It appears that CU and Boulder are gaslighting us. At a minimum::: they are committing fraud by taking full fare when they knew they would not deliver a real collegiate experience.  Either shut it down and refund; or open it up. This virus is tragic for some::: but statistically not worthy of cratering life for the 99+% who will be fine.  I question CU‚Äôs ability to even identify high education anymore.,I foresee that after this two week quarantine they will send the students home.,CU has completely failed their students! Way to fight for ur students! Such a disappointment!,I didn't see anything about not escorting someone. Logic dictates walking six feet apart to satisfy the order. Why so hysterical?,Do our part? Why not do yours? We all quarantined and the cases dropped::: but now they're going to go right back up again...,This is so condescending. I‚Äôm so glad I graduated a couple years ago.,Individuals have a right to request judicial review of the Order by filing an action with Boulder County District Court pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. ¬ß25-1-515.,I'm SOOOO glad they're doing this. This age group is one of the biggest problem groups because they just don't care. If I was still attending CU Boulder::: I'd be afraid to BE on campus::: and maybe dropped out by now... but this would have helped. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è,Outside by yourself and you still have to wear a mask wth!,It appears that CU and boulder‚Äôs game plan is to not address any safety concerns of their policies publicly. My guess is they will get around to formulating an intelligent policy in about 12 more days...,Why::: for the love of science and all rational thinking::: does that person need to be wearing a mask? In case someone sneaks up to give her a hug...in violation of the Boulder County public health order? Come on!,University starts classes mostly unabated during pandemic. Students don‚Äôt follow CDC guidelines Outbreaks start::: state numbers start to rise. Universities response: ask students nicely to follow guidelines. Bulk of responses in this thread: let them do whatever they want::: they can‚Äôt get oxygen with masks (I wonder how you all imagine hospital workers survive constantly wearing masks). There are so many things wrong here it is like some kind of bad satire skit on how stupid people are.,What a ridiculous photo! A person outside::: alone with a mask on. üôÑüôÑ How stupid.,So we should hold our breath in the campus elevators::: are we supposed to hold our breath outside on campus by ourselves too...? Hey there CU I‚Äôm a student with a disability which sometimes inhibits my ability to safely walk without assistance. If I‚Äôm arrested for getting assistance moving around campus to do my work::: you‚Äôll be hearing from a lawyer. Period.,Pretty sure these are the most extreme measures and restrictions in the country. You will lose students for this. Boulder is being talked about and mocked across the country. Look at ALL the numbers not just cases! And UPDATE to ACTIVE cases not just a running total! You make the numbers look alarming when you don‚Äôt say how many have actually recovered vs how many are currently active. You‚Äôre going to have to learn to function with this virus and people cannot live in isolation especially this age group!!,Why would you post this? Stop instilling fear. This is absolutely NOT OK.,I CANT EVEN!!! As an alumni and a huge fan I am so embarrassed.... And extremely upset for my dd. No other school in this country has these rules!!!üò°,Pure bullshit. Pardon the profanity but there no other word that‚Äôs as simple and accurate.,Open the campus or refund their money.,At least football team is still undefeated!,Who decided these were the CDC guidelines? They are not. More needless fear.,Best campus also back in 1974- 78!!!,It‚Äôs like the folks wearing masks driving in their cars....huh???,If you lived in Boulder you might understand,CU please provide proof that students are less at risk sharing dorms/ apartments::: food::: bathrooms than two roommates walking together::: six feet apart from others::: outside.  And that the general population substantially more at risk because these two roommates walk together outside and 6 feet away from others.,Denver and Boulder have increased numbers of Covid-19 cases. Keep your masks on & perform social distancing. BTW - My son went to Boulder::: his GF is currently there. Their friends have Covid-19... so i know!,Masks outside eh?,and 0% of the people commenting here have read the attached link about the public health order. üôÑ,UNSAFE to expect students to do all alone and RIDICULOUS to treat your students this way!,any lawsuits started? ill join in.,Utter nonsense for these kids to not be able to go for a hike with the people they already share rooms and bathrooms with!,This is a PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS::: worldwide.,99.997%. This is absolutely insane.,I agree. Look at the Florida has had and has been open the whole time.,Sounds like a great on-campus experience. Now it‚Äôs OK to sit outside::: but only if you do so in isolation with no human interaction. Oh::: and don‚Äôt forget to wear your mask while you‚Äôre isolated outside. That makes sense. And then make sure you‚Äôre all alone when you walk home because common sense safety measures no longer apply.,This is horrible. Not acceptable and a lot of safety issues here.,Wow this absolutely crazy but was predictable.,literally isolating every 18-22 year old,Don‚Äôt bite the hand that feeds you!!!,I think Kelly Szak should come home,1300 plus students tested positive for Covid,These campuses are in towns and cities inhabited by people who live there year round and make a living there. The kids don‚Äôt care::: they have been congregating in groups to party. They don‚Äôt care about the community. They need to realize this fact and be responsible to others and the community at large.,CU is more interested in playing politics than the safety of their women students. Allow two roommates to escort each other. They share food::: rooms::: bathrooms. Let them share the safety of being able to walk together. CU has for decades supported not walking alone for safety.  The boulder crime statistics and national COVID data indicates a female in the 18-22 age group is more likely to be raped or assaulted than dying of COVID.  Quit playing politics with our kids::: your students/ customers.,Cu is telling you to go against human nature and to isolate yourself from all your loved ones. Wear a mask to strip away you identity. Is this a communist university or what? Let‚Äôs get back to being human being and stop treating everyone like they have cuddles. Stop pushing fear.,I have read all of these comments and most are not from anyone who has anyone who has a child attending CU some are alumni as am I. I will say this has anyone who is on here had it with the severe effects of Covid or their child? Because I have and another Alumni Rob Feinberg is a Doctor in Denver who sees these kids and cases daily. As a survivor and long hauler until you have survived this and are left with permanent heart damage::: seizures::: breathing issues::: migraines and a myriad of other issues try to be a little less judgmental. I understand she is sitting in a field but CU is trying to protect the students and it‚Äôs a little far I agree. But remember the saying better safe then sorry? When you had when one to many drinks and someone took your keys? Perfectly healthy kids 18year olds with no symptoms are now showing heart damage. It‚Äôs a horrible disease yes disease bc viruses go away this doesn‚Äôt. Just my opinion.,I am a CSU student::: where CSU has more students than CU Boulder does. CSU has done a great job free consistent testing::: requiring masks::: discouraging off campus gatherings::: and providing resources to all their students. I haven‚Äôt heard of anyone complaining. When there was traces of the virus found in wastewater::: dorms were placed on quarantine and temporarily evacuated. They handled it great and immediately::: and students obeyed and did their part to help. I have personally seen and heard of many CU students going out::: partying::: and not wearing masks in general around Boulder. CU warned their students multiple times with no result. I am not surprised about the actions they put in place. I agree they are intense rules (and could have eased up on certain aspects)::: but it is more concerning that the extreme rules are being implemented because they see the situation as that bad.,Latest news on CDC website - the flu is more deadly than COVID-19. So why are they doing this?  ‚ÄúSeasonal flu infection/ mortality rates(IFR)accor ding to Tony Fauci are .1%. CDC‚Äôs latest data show the COVID infection fatality rate for Americans in 0-19 age group is O.003% and in the 19-49 age group 0.02%.  Combining 0-49 year olds::: which represent 64% of US population::: the IFR is 0.01% which means flu is TEN times as lethal as COVID.  This number is 1/50th the death rates predicted by modeling funded by Bill Gates that Dr Fauci cited to justify the lockdowns in March. CDC‚Äôs new data show that COVID IFRs for people over 65 are much higher:::though still lower than flu in that group.‚Äù  https:// www.cdc.gov/ coronavirus/ 2019-ncov/hcp/ planning-scenari os.html,Or maybe CU should do the responsible thing and not be open in the first place..... Ignorant idiots. Close the fucking school. People clearly cannot handle it::: nor can those teenagers follow rules it seems. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if those assholes were having COVID parties like those hillbilly morons in Alabama. #shameful #ashamedalum,Suicide is the leading cause of death among Colorado youth between the ages of 10 and 24. But we are isolating these students even more. Disconnecting them from friends and community. For what? Mental health issues and suicide is taking lives by the thousands::: but Covid is not for this age group. https:// www.coloradoinde pendent.com/ .../ colorado-youth.. ./,"What a sad::: economically devastating::: and evil hoax is now being played on students and citizens everywhere. We are all being assaulted by a UN Agenda 21/ Big Pharma plandemic (google Event 201 and the videos of the great American researcher Rosa Koire) happening in 192 other countries as well as here in the alleged Land of the Free. As the saying goes ""It's easier to fool people than to convince them that they've been fooled."" College students in particular are being targeted by the psychopaths at the top of the World Economic Forum::: the W.H.O.::: and the Gates Foundation (Klaus Schwab::: Tedros Adhanom::: Fauci::: Gates::: Birx::: ad nauseum) with an assist from their useful idiots and stooges in college administration offices. This newly published article blows the lid off ongoing ""Casedemic"" that's being used to keep the fear train rolling in spite of this new study showing TWO hospitalizations and ZERO deaths among the 48:::000+ ""cases"" (revealed by the hopelessly inaccurate PCR test) in 37 colleges and universities across the US. Time to WAKE UP and RESIST these unconstitutiona l assaults on our freedom! https:// www.thegatewaypu ndit.com/2020/ 09/ scam-48299-covid -19-cases-37-us -universities-2 -hospitalizatio ns-zero-deaths- likely-killed-d og/ ?utm_source=Face book&utm_medium =PostTopSharing Buttons&utm_cam paign=websitesh aringbuttons&fb clid=IwAR2yIi8c CVrcUwSFm2Y7uRb 64Df9NmOXRliC3h CIJaMVorGe7_JUs Smf30w",The public health order is not only ILLEGAL::: but was justified thru LYING about the data. Unfortunately i cant post the image of the graph analysis. But i can tell you that not only was that data completely wrong::: but the testing itself has been manipulated to reach these conclusions. My commentary of BCPHs post is below explaining everything but the interpretation of their graph  This shit has gone too far. The blatant manipulation here could not be more obvious. Not to mention the straight up illegal and criminal aspect of this.  ‚Ä¢1- they released peoples home addresses. ‚Ä¢2- they are telling women they have to walk alone. On the hill. At CU. A notoriously bad place for sexual assault. ‚Ä¢3-this is blatant age discrimination. Fully illegal. ‚Ä¢4-they are quarintining entire households. Not just ‚Äúcovid+‚Äù people. Healthy people are being held hostage. Thats kidnapping and tyranny. And theyre forcing them to go broke and hungry by threatening them with criminal prosecution if they go to work or even the grocery. HEALTHY PEOPLE. ‚Ä¢5- its extremely clear that the ONLY reason they are ‚Äúseeing more cases from this specific age group‚Äù is that they are only testing this specific age group and are doing so WEEKLY. Let me refer AGAIN to the PCR test and how it works and is being used and manipulated to pad these numbers: the PCR test is NOT RECOMMENDED to be used in this way to begin with. It is not accurate to begin with. Its is not being used properly. ALSO the labs have been running FAR too many cycles(limit for anything valid is 30- which they have been exceeding) which amplifies the particulate and forces the test to pick up dead::: broken::: and INEFFECTIVE particulate. Which = FALSE POSITIVE/NOT SICK\\NOT CONTAGIOUS aka NOTHING LEGITIMATE TO REPORT.  *folks this is why these tests and the manipulation are so dangerous. They can force it to show positive then use tbat as justification to do whatever they want to us. This is HIGHLY important right now as they are still THREATENING(wor d specifically used) a second wave. Thats not happening or not gonna happen but they can fake it. Please be keen to your actual reality and not what you are being told is your reality.  Honestly could keep going on whats wrong ith this and the ACTUAL damage they are causing here. But the points above are sufficient legaly. I hope BCPH gets the living shit sued out of them. To say there are angry parents is an understatement. Theyve been getting ripped a new asshole in the comments. Feel free to add to it. On a positive note- hey BCPH thanks for waking more people up to the fascism plan and scamdemic!,I have contacted everyone below and if you feel that the recent Boulder County Public Health ‚ÄúOrder‚Äù is an egregious overreach and violates your son‚Äôs or daughter‚Äôs basic human and U.S. Constitutional rights::: liberties and freedoms::: then I would encourage you::: and perhaps even your student::: to do the same and voice your opinion.

Why are you not advocating for our kids?,Reminder: Assaults::: rape::: and abductions can happen during the day not just at night. Amend the policy and allow students to pair up for safety when out for essential activities.,Bad.,Or you can just withdraw. Sounds like a better plan to me.,You want my daughter to walk through your campus alone at night To get some food you're out of your mind,The university supposedly stands for the students. Why are they not appalled by this age discrimination against their community? Why are they not threatening to sue because it‚Äôs is not constitutional. It threatens the solvency of their institution which is the reason Boulder is what it is. Stop being a victim and stand up for your students! You are an embarrassment to your community and it‚Äôs alumni!,You are out of your goddamn minds.,You party::: you act irresponsibly::: there are consequences. Staying virus free but alone is preferable to being sick. Yes::: kids who were responsible have to deal with these consequences too. My daughter is at CU. The parties on the Hill are why this happened. It's for two weeks. Behavior will have to be altered. Only go places when absolutely necessary. Don't walk after dark. Stay in your room. Go for food::: come back. Face time with friends. Not so hard. My kid is fine. Yours will be too.,This is absolutely not OK CU. My daughter flew home this weekend while we continue to pay an absurd amount of rent for her to live in a house with roommates but because you continue to place lock down rules on these students in which you don‚Äôt pay the rent or tuition for she doesn‚Äôt feel like she should be there and the mental state of these students is at stake. Why don‚Äôt you lock the whole town down? Why are you targeting 18-22 year olds??? This whole thing has been a nightmare. YET FOOTBAll starts and Highschool‚Äôs are in and also the sports? This is discrimination against 18-22 years olds and CU better make this right.,Please fight for your students and get the order changed so that 2 students can be together. This Is absurd and unsafe! Don‚Äôt forget who makes you great CU....and you are nothing without your students!!!,Is it accurate that They were/are charging kids $80 to take an online class about COVID if a rule was broken? 5 girls in a room. 2 roommates plus 3 friends. 1 person too many. Each kid has to take an online class for $80. Guess COVID education is for profit.,How are you planning to keep students::: especially young women::: safe when they need to go get food alone at night? You are aware of the MULTIPLE assaults that happen on campus each year. All of this could have been avoided had you just gone remote from the beginning and never had freshman move on campus. Now you‚Äôre getting so much bad press and all because you want to keep your precious tuition money. I hate this school now and wish I could transfer but can‚Äôt because of the way my degree program works. I thought this was supposed to be a top notch university::: but really you guys are just complete idiots. And don‚Äôt go saying ‚Äúoh it‚Äôs the students‚Äô fault‚Äù because yeah it is but you should‚Äôve known better. You literally just wanted money and you care nothing for student safety. You need to go 100% remote for the rest of the semester::: close campus down::: and send your freshman home. Stop dragging it out.,All the people imploring the University to stand up to the health department(s) are missing the big picture.  The University of Colorado Boulder could have avoided all this if they‚Äôd heeded advisories::: science::: and data. They chose instead to go with a more...‚Äùnuanced ‚Äù approach which would lead to them collecting the most money and gambling with the health of the student body::: staff::: and the community at large.  It is not surprising that the health department(s) are stepping in now. And the sad truth of it likely is that this is how the university prefers things play out.  They collect their money and then follow whatever the health department(s) dole out. Then when things grind to a predictable halt::: the university (under the woeful leadership of President Mark Kennedy) gets to throw up their hands and say: ‚Äúnot our fault; just complying with health orders‚Äù.  Disappointed to watch this all unfold over the last several months.,Is the mental health of isolated and lonely students not just as important as their physical health? (I‚Äôm not talking about getting homesick. The reports of depression and even risk for suicide have increased greatly. The public health order does not address mental health crisis intervention).,Hey CU! It‚Äôs Sunday. Is my 21 year old son allowed to go to church today::: or can he be arrested and expelled for that too??,I think you‚Äôre ridiculous af if you think students are going to comply with these extreme rules. Step the fuck up CU. CSU is doing it right. Maybe take a look at what they‚Äôre doing.,This is a power play by the County and I am shocked that the students and staff are not storming the next council meeting. Targeting a certain age group for a stay at home order is unconscionable. I believe that CU has done a good job overall managing COVID and I have felt very safe with my son at school. This is very sad that politics are ruining these kids college experience and wasting our money.,Plus you realize that most of the ideas you have for fighting homesickness cannot be implemented?! It‚Äôs midterms and you have stressed out kids who can‚Äôt even study or get a coffee with one other person. It‚Äôs a recipe for disaster. I really can‚Äôt believe you haven‚Äôt fought the health department on this. And if you have fought them::: you should get your PR department doing overtime.,This is bullshit!,Thank god I graduated from this school a couple of years ago. These are insane over reactive orders which will do WAY worse for mental health than it will the 1 in a million chance of a student dying by not enforcing this insanity. All you have to do is keep those at risk away from students who are more likely to be spreading the virus. This could be done more efficiently in a thousand other ways. What a shame.,Follow the link and there a place for questions. I just filled it out and asked for the university to explain how they are going to keep the young women safe now that predators know that they are walking alone. This is not right!!!,Would any other industry intentionally and blatantly treat their customers this bad ? It sounds like many students are considering not coming back for the spring semester. It will be interesting to see the transfer rate.,Emma,https:// www.thedenvercha nnel.com/news/ local-news/ as-covid-19-surg es-number-of-st udents-withdraw ing-from-cu-bou lder-doubles,It‚Äôs not about anyone‚Äôs safety::: it‚Äôs all about staying open at all cost for the dollars. üí¥ Everything CU is doing is for show and Boulder County Health is going to support the University at all cost.,Does CU have a Chief Medical Officer?!! Take care of your students and staff. And when the heck are you going to have a Parents Town Hall?!!,‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è,I‚Äôve said this a few times now...if masks work then at a minimum allow 2 kids to be together::: if they don‚Äôt then why are we wearing them? There is no common sense going on here. Can you name any other community that has been so punitive to 18-22 year olds in their college towns?,How about making it safe - mentally physically for our kids and revise gatherings to be at least two people. It‚Äôs ludicrous. On your own web pages you discourage kids from walking alone. Students walking outside in a mask with their roommate is a threat to no one. Use common sense please and work with BCPH to revise this one aspect of the mandate.,Sure makes it difficult to watch schools like OU and Auburn playing football::: having fans in the stands when we know students there and they are spiking in Covid counts::: YET if my son needs to go to the hospital::: his roommates can‚Äôt take him!!! It‚Äôs inSANE people!! He sent me a pic of a sign on an elevator that stated HOLD BREATH WHILE IN ELEVATOR - BREATHING CAUSES THE SPREAD OF DROPLETS!!!! What are they doing at University of Miami? Florida State? Alabama? Weren‚Äôt their students having Covid parties?!?! I get we need to be careful::: but the depression that is RAMPANT in Boulder and the consequences that follow will be on CU and the Boulder Health departments hands!,Is the CU night walk / night ride operating? It definitely should be::: Boulder has never been a safe place for women to walk alone at night.,CU Boulder::: you‚Äôve made a BIG mistake enforcing this ordinance. Such extreme measures are ridiculous . Asking students to be alone for most activities including being outside with a mask on?? The consequences of this action remain to be seen::: but it will lie heavily on your shoulders.,"University of Colorado Boulder You will want to correct the definition of gathering as it states a gathering is ‚Äúone or more individuals coming together or being physically near each other..."". It should be either ""more than one"" as in the BCPH order or ""two or more"". Thank you for putting this outline together.",So two freshmen can share a small door room together but they can be fined or go to jail for going on a hike together? We were swindled into believing there would be small cohort groups that were never implemented.,So how will the football team practice?,Just because Boulder has lost its self-righteous::: social shaming mind doesn‚Äôt mean CU has to. CU should no longer be in the same sentence as higher education.  CU = FRAUD,Unconscionable. CU this is such a disappointment and a ludicrous way to treat students. You will alienate them and lose their trust for the remainder of their time at CU. And isolation is damaging and unsafe.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Everything just says that 18 to 22 year olds can't be gathering that's all it prohibits. There is nothing saying you can't leave your house.,Definitely get your flu shots now!,How about in addition to flu shots you start requiring ALL students (off and on campus) be COVID tested?! I asked this question from the beginning and got crickets. Cornell did this and they have ONE positive case today. You did the community in and outside the university a disservice by not testing all your students and staff on a regular basis like the on campus kids. Now we have this insane edict that kids need to be alone outside. Would you tell your daughter to walk alone at all times? It‚Äôs ludicrous.,no need for 18-22 years to leave their jail cells to get a flu shot. I mean if they have three people together as opposed to two or if they're 23 or 17 it's perfectly safe but those 18 to 22-year-olds are going to destroy this country and kill us all remember. The flu shot is for older people or those that are compromised by other health issues...kind of like Covid but you know whatever who cares about facts and science,My last toxic jabs were on campus @ wardenburg 11 years ago. It's the last time me or anyone after me in family will receive this poison. u can opt out of the toxic jab too::: its 100% FREE! Did u know theres over $4 billion paid out by the government to vaccine injured families? (bc the vaccine manufacturers are exempt from liability due to the Childhood vaccine act being passed in 1986) ü§ÆAlso the majority of the payments are primarily for the flu shot!

A new Boulder County Public Health order begins at 4 p.m. on Thursday::: Sept. 24. All gatherings within the city of Boulder involving any people 18-22 years of age are prohibited::: and residents of specific off-campus properties are subject to stringent Stay-at-Home restrictions.  Read more details about the order::: the additional support we are providing and the choices before each of our students at the link below:  COLORADO.EDU COVID-19 Updates & Resources,2020-09-24 14:37:33,If your attending CU::: please get together and sue the city and county. This is beyond prevention. You have rights regardless of what these geniuses say.,I hope the students organize a protest.,Can I get my money back for this semester?,Seems like just another way Boulder PD can squeeze money out of students. Not everyone is a trust fund baby.,So you‚Äôre keeping the INDOOR rec center open but if two students go for a walk together outside then that‚Äôs crossing the line? I regret going to this school so much,Why the panic? Are folks dropping like flies in Boulder? Boulder has lost its mind. It sounds like they intend to punish anyone not publicly demonstrating fear::: specifically CU students.,If you're between the ages of 60 and 67 you should not be gathering are going to restaurants as well stay home,Well if they actually listened and followed rules in the first place this wouldn‚Äôt be a problem. Stupid is as stupid does,"lmao so basically ""to stop the surge we're closin' up shop for 2 weeks hurhurhur"" why was campus even open to begin with? barely anyone hanging out on the hill has been wearing a mask. its all just poor planning &coordination tbh üëÄ",üò≥üò≥üò≥Hardest part is two roommates can not walk together even though they live together. I need to wrap my head around this. Maybe City Council will rethink their position. How about no parties::: wear mask and social distance.,This order is ill-advised. I have two adult children in this age range who have abided by the rules. To ban them from continuing to gather in small::: socially distanced groups with masks while allowing 23 year olds and up to still do so is outrageous. This is an ill-targetted public health order which I hope the county public health office will reconsider.,Any other parents out there who are as mad as I am ?? My son just told me 2 students ( roommates ) were walking to the dining hall together and got a 1:::000 fine ::: this is not ok !!!,Targeting the age range who pays your bills isn‚Äôt cute.

I swear the people making these rules are dumb AF .I hope nobody follows this,Boy am I glad I graduated and got the hell out of Boulder. The punitive and overreaching actions that are being put in place are shameful.,Surely age specific restrictions aren't legal,What a joke::: college students are treated like second hand citizens. Why not treat all adults equally here? This rule is beyond ridiculous.,All of the people complaining about the specific ages... would you still complain if they straight up locked down the whole city again? County? State? They listed that range because it is the common age range of college students.,This makes no sense. Where is the science behind this?,Isn‚Äôt that discrimination to single out a specific age of people?,Could Boulder Stop punishing the students::: please! The Boulder County Health organization and the State were in collaboration to bring students to campus. And now you want to punish the students for being in Boulder::: supporting your economy::: paying salaries for your staff::: and paying fees for going outside their homes? As a parent::: I am outraged at the reaction of the the Boulder County Health targeting specific homes of students. All students are in Boulder to GET AN EDUCATION! Let the students go to class! FYI...Governor Polis okayed the local high school to have a football season. How‚Äôs that for a contrast to Boulder Health effectively putting students in ‚Äúhouse arrest‚Äù.,This is comical. You reap what you sow. Come down on the party people::: not those at risk. No wonder there‚Äôs so much entitlement. Just read above!,If off campus students are having issues with WiFi::: can they go to a campus location (I.e. the study tents or UMC) if they‚Äôre alone and not at one of the properties on the order?,Age discrimination The city and county of Boulder whants all the restaurants to go broke,So how does this impact students who have many roommates? If a student and his 7 other roomies are hanging in there house is that a gathering? This is ridiculous.,Did I miss something here? What‚Äôs with the draconian measures?? Yesterday there were 23 positives on campus. The new cases are trending down::: and there doesn‚Äôt appear to be a surge in community spread so what‚Äôs with this order?,"I really feel CU Boulder and the City could have acted faster to quell the off dorm partying. Several weeks ago there were over 120 noise complaints in the Hill over one weekend. That means partying in numbers. So the Greeks and other large party houses which have been identifed as outbreaks sources partied without consequence and now dorm kids face arrest if they walk to get a box meal with their roommate even with a mask its a "" gathering"".. Inaction has turned a pretty bad college experience into an isolating paranoid experience for dorm students.",They should keep this public health order in place for the rest of history. That way everyone can stay safe and never get sick and die.,Everyone::: everyone::: should ignore this order.,"Replace ""18-22-year-old s"" with ""African-Americ ans"" or ""homosexuals:::"" and you can clearly see how this order is 100% unconstitutiona l and illegal.",What a shit show::: so happy our child decided to take this semester off.,I hope they enforce the order. Many students at CU think this is a joke. They are putting everybody and all the businesses at risk! I am very disappointed with how this has been handled so far. It is time these young adults realize that there are consequences to their behavior.,This is by no way legal::: anti-discrimina tion laws also include age. Boulder will probably have to reword this for all individuals. Also::: what did they expect to happen by bringing everyone back? Kids are going to party::: because thats what the majority of college aged individuals are...just kids,How totally unnecessary. So glad I don‚Äôt have to put up with this garbage and needless restriction on freedom. Quarantine does not work and this age group needs to be exposed to the virus to promote community immunity. Get real.,Right. My son reported a party behind his house of about 40 people last week to the Boulder police::: who never bothered to show up. If you're gonna push restrictions::: you better have the manpower to enforce them.,So a married couple (there are married couples in this age group)::: can‚Äôt go to the supermarket together::: out to eat::: go for a walk or bike ride together etc? This is way overreaching::: city of Boulder.,These poor kids thought they were signing up to attend school. They paid their tuition::: paid for their room and board and are instead being jailed. This is over the top.,Apparently you aren't aware of how this virus is really affecting our state. Either you follow the new rules or we go back to a full lockdown in boco. Which I actually support.,So I guess if they want to hike or do outdoor activities::: they need to go outside of Boulder? It‚Äôs a good thing there‚Äôs nothing at all outdoorsy to do in the general areaüò°,"What does ""All Gatherings"" mean??? Please clarify so students don't get in trouble just because they don't fully understand the mandate",If they have been on college campus and in contact with any of the other students::: I would prefer they not come in retail store and stick to curbside. It's not about age::: it's about who has most likely been contaminated already.  Honestly though; this is how the year round residents are already behaving. No one I know is doing dine-in or shopping in large groups::: or having dinner guests. The adult numbers are flat because this isn't news to us.  I am not hiking with friends::: doing dine in::: taking ubers::: or shopping in person so....welcome to the club?,So::: as a 22-year-old grad student who lives off-campus::: I‚Äôm not allowed to go on hikes with my partner whom I live with?? This is absurd.,So let me get this right I‚Äôm gonna get arrested if I‚Äôm outside with my friends but you won‚Äôt move my Covid positive roommate out of our communal dorm before the rest of us get sick?,CU this is absurd. Infringement on 18-22 year old rights. Thank you for trying to imprison them inside their homes. This is not happening.,Boulder has limited resources if all the students get Covid or sick would it‚Äôs own pandemic for the city. It‚Äôs sad that the few had to ruin it for the many:(,how many people are in a gathering? My son lives with 7 other boys.,Other college towns across the nation have had larger spikes in cases than Boulder and managed the situation without these extreme measures and been effective. Maybe Boulder should look at how other towns are managing::: because this is ridiculous!,This is absolutely absurde. My daughter got into great schools in California::: but she chose Boulder. What a regret . SHAME on you guys because you knew from the beginning this would happen::: but because of how money hungry you guys are you opened up the dorms and now you hold them as prisoners. What a waste of money that went in your pocket. It‚Äôs pathetic how your staff sits at home and does everything remotely and get paid::: but our children have to risk their lives. I wish my daughter went to San Diego and got treated way better than you people that run this school. SHAME SHAME,Praying for Buffs to act in ways that are for the common good. As an alumni of the business school I expect more from you all.,Brought my son home with no clear commitment to return. Not out of as much concern for COVID but his own well-being based on the university's restrictions. When I filled out the form required if he was leaving campus::: it seemed they were less concerned about him and more focused on us understanding if we were to move our student off campus for any period of time::: we'd still be on the hook for full tuition and room and board. This reinforced to me how much these restrictions vs. sending students home on-line was about the $$. Having had a daughter who graduated virtually last year under chaos::: my confidence in CU in their priority for the students has made me question the choice of our son and where we go from here.,Cub dashboard lists 933 as the total number of cases over five weeks time period.

Totally unreal!!!  You shoulda never had in person learning to begin with!!! Totally unreal,Everyone who is complaining::: you do realize that its either this or our local businesses are forced to close right? I agree this is hard on the kids::: but since they are the main source of the outbreak - I need to remind folks that a few weeks sacrifice for 18-22 to stay indoors is far better than our local business owners suffering::: hence our local economy. This seems like a last ditch effort to avoid a county-wide lockdown. The college was clearly ill prepared to hold in person learning/ living::: so I am sorry the kids are the ones that need to suffer. But::: I am more concerned about our local economy at this point.,After students paid tuition & fees to attend CU in person Boulder County makes an ordinance 18-22 year olds::: which just happens to be the main demographic::: can't gather in groups. Do you suppose CU & Boulder County made a mutual decision not to cancel classes or do on-line only classes until the required tuition & fees had been paid & then put out the ordinance in the name of health & safety. CU should have offered on-line only classes or canceled classes altogether but then CU nor Boulder County would have generated revenue for tuition & fees including out-of-state tuition & on & off-campus housing for in-state students.,So Boulder County /CU would prefer my daughter to walk around Boulder and campus alone than with her roommate? In 2019 Boulder reported 504 assaults and 114 sex assaults With only 353 covid deaths YTD for her age group nationwide so far.

The off campus students have been publicly partying since August WITHOUT ANY REPERCUSSIONS WHATSOEVER. Most of the Dorms kids like my son are paying the price. If CU is subjecting my son to possible arrest and subsequent expulsion for violating these rules that's nuts.

Boulder County Public Health After working with the attorneys::: we wanted to share some updates and clarifications on the new Public Health Order. Please remember the purpose of the order is to keep people separated so that the virus does not spread. This is good for everyone in the community::: both by keeping the COVID-19 infection rate down::: and by helping businesses stay open at the current level. If the new infection rate remans high::: businesses might be required to reduce the services they currently offer. The worst case scenario is we could all be put back under a Stay-At-Home Order by the state. This is not about finding loopholes to the Order::: but helping to reduce the rate of infection. * Public Transportation & Ride Sharing (like Uber) for people not living at a Restricted Address The purpose of the order is to keep people separated so that the virus does not spread::: so we‚Äôd like everyone to do their best to find alternatives for the next 13 days. If it's necessary to use these services::: or share a ride in a personal vehicle::: wear a mask and stay as socially distanced as possible. After reaching your destination you need to keep separate from others::: so a gathering does not take place. * Transportation for Medical Emergencies for people living at a Restricted Address. If it is a true medical emergency to get medical care::: you can use Ride Sharing::: etc. Wear a mask and keep a social distance. Please remember::: the purpose of the order is to keep people separated so the virus does not continue to spread. *Escorts during the night or other unsafe times The purpose of the order is to keep people separated so that the virus does not spread. We‚Äôd like everyone to do their best to find alternatives for the next 13 days.,You need to refund their tuition. You let the frats have control of this situation::: and you knew they were going to do this based on their St. Pat's behavior.  You didn't ban the frats before the school year because they have rich daddies.,üá∫üá∏Ô∏è #BanPeople18to22 FromGathering? #WTFover?  Dear Governor Jared Polis::: and Attorney General Phil Weiser:::  I awoke to the insane news that Boulder county is attempting to ban Americans aged 18-22 from gathering in groups ostensibly for coronavirus. Please tell me this ridiculous un-American un-Constitution al attempt to suppress an inevitable revolution is not true.  In my American life::: I have seen terrible abuses of the young by the old. I have been sent to questionable wars by the old::: denied a home by the old::: tricked into working for free at unpaid internships by the old. Yet I have never heard of the old being such disgusting craven selfish bastards that they would stop the entire country and stop the lives of the young::: stop the young from gathering and stop the young from mating::: stop all the small businesses and make poor Americans poorer::: in order to protect their own lives at all cost from a disease with no known cure.  It is 15 years since I graduated from the U.S. Air Force Academy and 13 years since I returned from foreign war in Fallujah Iraq on YOUR behalf::: and on behalf of the people of Colorado. In all that time::: you fucking selfish bastards of Colorado have refused to share the homes with me::: forced me to sleep in the streets::: and sent Colorado Springs Police Department to cruelly bully me and deny me sleep. I am forced to conclude that the only way to save my people from homelessness in Colorado is to arm homeless Americans::: organize into militias::: and seize homes in Colorado by force.  This attempt to ban gatherings of young Americans age 18-22 is absurd::: and reflects perfectly the craven selfishness of the older generation of Americans::: who have always acted as if they are the only generation in America::: as if the entire country revolves around them. Strike down this ridiculous ban on young people gathering::: Mr. Governor::: Mr. Attorney General. This is an egregious un-American un-Constitution al overreach and infringement by the state of Colorado against the American people.

Recognizing the growing concern about the increase in positive COVID-19 cases in Boulder::: the City of Boulder::: the Boulder County Public Health Department and the University of Colorado-Boulder will begin offering weekly community briefings to provide updates to::: and take questions from::: the public. The first one is tomorrow at 10am MT. Click the link below for more information and to register.  BOULDERCOLORADO.GOV City and Partner Organizations Invite Community Members to Join Online Weekly COVID Briefing,2020-09-24 00:17:03,Que the comments from the citizens of Boulder that hate the students::: but don‚Äôt understand the city depends on the money they bring to the city.,So Boulder County /CU would prefer my daughter to walk around Boulder and campus alone than with her roommate? In 2019 Boulder reported 504 assaults and 114 sex assaults With only 353 covid deaths YTD for her age group nationwide so far. Her odds of getting raped or assaulted is much greater than dying of covid. https:// bouldercolorado. gov/police/ crime-statistics https:// www.cdc.gov/ nchs/nvss/vsrr/ covid_weekly/ index.htm How is this going to work with the Night Ride service https:// www.colorado.edu /today/2005/08/ 21/ night-ride-servi ce-offers-free- safe-transporta tion-cu-student s  CU has offered escorts since at least the early 80‚Äôs. So they have already acknowledged a level of risk for the young women of CU in walking alone on campus. BCPH and CU have essentially told all sexual predators that single young women will now be alone. That seems to increase the risk to the women.  In addition denying them access to public transportation and ride share services forces many to walk. Walk alone.  After decades of encouraging them to walk with a friend::: escort or buddy for safety. How can you now deny them this safety? Change the policy so they can at least walk with one other person.,The outbreak was a predictable results of holding classes in person. The many cases that have spread among the students will continue to spread among the community and people will die as a result. Others will end up with organ damage. For a few weeks of in-person classes before moving online anyway::: it wasn‚Äôt worth it. The people who made the decision to have in-person classes should be held responsible.,What a joke!,Send the students home. You are keeping Boulder children from going to school and endangering the community because your students won't follow the rules.,Hold the chancellor accountable for his crime against the town by endangering it::: and the absolute lack of care for the lives of students. Yes there are students to blame::: but his negligence addressing this issue as well as his lack of foresight are why we‚Äôre here. They sent us home in spring with something like less than a hundred cases and brought us back in the peak of the pandemic. No accountability. Whatsoever. Of course only after we pay our tuition bills at full price for a campus we can‚Äôt even use.,Boulder and CU have become a shitshow.,Come up with a solution to manage through the crisis::: or shutdown class and return the money. Locking kids in their house indefinitely is not leadership::: it's negligent. Figure it out or admit you can't and shut it down. What a joke,It was reported today from 37 universities across the country::: including CU::: that there have been only 2 hospitalization s and zero deaths. This entire thing is ridiculous. Go out and get some flipping dirt under your nails and buck up. Don't go home::: stay on campus and get the bug::: get over it and then move on with an improved immune system in a much::: much better condition to handle future viruses.,College towns across the US are managing spikes in cases due to students returning to campus. Many have already managed the spike and now are back to reasonable levels::: all without these extreme measures by the city. Boulder needs to look outside itself for guidance on fair and reasonable management of the situation. All 18-22 year olds are not irresponsible and causing this situation.,So as a student and boulder citizen. I‚Äôm sad that is so called loving and inclusive town::: is not being any of that. I thought I grow up in a town of understanding people but I guess the times have changed. The University students bring in more revenue for all the small business::: then all the full time residents combined.  No one should be surprised that‚Äôs cases went up. Not a single college student as been hospitalized as a result of Covid case since returning to campus.  It‚Äôs like all of you have forgotten what you where like in college. An in person education is what everyone wants we want to be in class learning. Students pick CU because of what it offers. If they wanted online degrees I promise the University of Phoenix is cheaper but doesn‚Äôt offer everything this amazing campus does.  CU will always be part of Boulder. If you hate campus that much might be time to look at moving to a new town. This town is great because of the diversity the campus brings.  Football games of Saturday‚Äôs and football rally‚Äôs on Fridays nights which fill the restaurant on Pearl durning the slow season in tourism.  CU is not the reason your kids aren‚Äôt back in school. Boulder Valley::: Jeffco::: St. Vrain all canceled in person the week before we came back. So take that up with the school board and city council.  However we are the reason that tons of small business owners are going to survive the lock downs after making almost no revenue durning spring and all summer. Just remember there are locals that really on the extra sales to maintain a living.,"""Growing concern""?!??

Be Your Best Stay-at-Home Buff. Stay at home; no gatherings; wear a face covering; stay 6 feet apart; get tested. Protect Our Herd: Stay-at-home notice for local CU Boulder students in effect through Sept. 29. www.colorado.edu/covid-19,2020-09-19 18:59:45,It‚Äôs hilarious that you think cu boulder students are going to follow this. Naiive. You‚Äôre just postponing the inevitable of having to shut down for good.,Brady Mcdonnell,Went for a walk the other night near CU east campus- many apartments were having gatherings indoors with no masks::: alcohol::: and groups of more than 5 people. There‚Äôs also groups gathering on and near sidewalks::: making it hard to even be outdoors. I came home and my neighbors above and next door have invited people over. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs safe to say many students are not listening to the strong recommendations . From March until Aug::: Boulder kept its cases okay::: even with students who were still renting off campus. So please don‚Äôt say the situation would be the same if campus closed. We saw those numbers and they were better.,This should be the baseline behavior::: not the response to an outbreak.,I hope you get answers soon. Praying your daughter does not catch it.,If you live in Boulder and drive by the hill at any time of day on any day you'll find at least two houses breaking literally all of these rules during that three minutes of your drive.,So say you have a rental house across the street from you miles from campus where several students live::: and they have a big party. Hypothetically speaking of course::: because we know CU students wouldn't make such an incredibly stupid and reckless choice. But if that hypothetically happened (again::: it wouldn't::: right?)::: what should a concerned citizen of the community do?,My daughter is trying to stay away from campus and following guidelines in her off campus apartment::: but one class remains in-person. Professor is pretty strict about coming MWF. If this is supposed to be a 2-week reset type quarantine::: then why for this 2-weeks period make kids come in? Confused.,Wow. Just shut down the world according to everyone on here. Students are humans. Just like everyone::: some follow guidelines and some don‚Äôt. Move on with life people. I‚Äôm so tired of reading posts and comments bashing students. Look in the mirror first.,None of them have any consideration for the community::: not CU or the students::: irresponsible all of them,Please dont throw that party this weekend Eduardo Elian Torres you can wait until next week,You need to shut down the campus and change to online classes only. This is getting ridiculous!!,CU created this disaster by opening the University .... Shame on you. How in the world are students who live in dorms to social distance ... such a disgrace to the CU University not to mention the students .... Be honest CU you did this for the money ..frankly CU you suck nuts,how about you shut down your school during the middle of a pandemic and stop expecting 18 year olds to follow rules when they‚Äôve been accepted into one of the biggest party schools in the nation...?,Shame on you::: CU,Wow wow,765 confirmed covid cases::: please shut down campus,Much too late for this ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many of the campus buildings::: even the nicer ones generally have poor ventilation and are designed such that social distancing is practically impossible! That and so many idiots there were throwing parties enabling the virus to spread. Granted::: I really wanted to go to school there at CU Boulder but made the difficult decision to cancel going to school there this year. Already::: there have been spikes in cases there and it reinforces my opinion that I made the right decision to STAY HOME! I can lose a few years of school. I cannot lose my life or loved ones‚Äô lives to this virus. Quarantine::: lockdown::: and CLOSE campus until at least February and implement strict measures against parties on and off campus either until the virus dies out or a vaccine is proven to be safe and effective.,I wear a mask to make others feel comfortable. However::: I am also educated enough to realize that paper/cotton/ synthetic masks do not stop a virus which is approximately 80-100 nanometers in size. Even an N95 mask has a pore size of 100 to 300 nanometers.  Thankfully::: hospitalization rates are plunging. Fatality rates are also declining rapidly with very few under 60 years of age without existing health conditions. Data is available on CO and CDC sites. @alexberenson is also a great resource.

This means that 94% of the COVID-19 Death Toll the CDC has been announcing is not true!!!  Which means this virus is Not as deadly as what Americans have been told it is.  CDC::: can you explain why you haven‚Äôt announced this on Mainstream Media yet??? And why::: on your Facebook page you are still saying the COVID-19 Death Toll in the US is over 180:::000 people??? What‚Äôs 6% of 180:::000???? That‚Äôs the real number!!!!,This is a very important part::: no kidding.

It also retards the force of expulsion with the layer that wouldn‚Äôt be there. Facts are interesting when you understand the:::.,Melissa::: if masks work and those wearing with medical conditions are wearing them::: they should be protected from a healthy person not wearing one.,CLOSE THE UNIVERSITY DOWN!  Most people of this age::: simply act this way. They crave the social interaction.  This is NOT respectful to the year round residents. Keep the sick students in quarantine until they test negative and send the others home until January.  Have the state do an executive order to let them out of their leases both on and off campus. This is on the shoulders of the state and the university.,Staying home so I don't have to wear one. Thank goodness for Door dash,The covid mortality rate for people under 50 is less than for the flu. Why are you worried? If you have a medical condition protect yourself. Everyone else should be acting normal.,There is no proof of this. Studies show it may provide an increase of protection around 1%. Meanwhile there are many reasons healthy people should not wear a mask. Just watch people play with their masks::: spreading germs::: whereas if they did not have the stupid thing on their face they would not be touching so much. Plus::: you know people are not throwing away the disposable masks every day and not washing the cloth ones.

Because of a significant rise in COVID-19 cases linked primarily to CU Boulder students::: and to protect the health and safety of the community::: our campus is fully cooperating with the Boulder County Public Health recommendation that all of our local undergraduate and graduate students immediately self-quarantine for two weeks in their campus-area home or residence hall. CU Boulder will be enforcing this measure::: which expires at 11:59 p.m. on Tuesday::: Sept. 29.  Quarantine is not the same as isolation. It is avoiding in-person interactions with others::: monitoring yourself for symptoms and following health precautions. Students may leave their residences only to attend in-person classes::: labs::: research activities and intercollegiate athletic trainings; obtain food::: medicine::: medical care::: including seeking COVID-19-related testing; work and taking children to school/child care; and exercise by themselves (the Rec Center remains open).  The campus will continue to support students with dining::: monitoring::: testing::: medical care and mental health services. Additionally::: virtual events and programs will be offered for students to engage outside of the classroom in the safest way possible.

Priorities::: right? ü§Ø,They‚Äôre on double secret quarantine probation!,University of Colorado Boulder::: you guys are still half-assing it.  Given opportunity after opportunity to show you can step up and lead as an example of societal responsibility and a bastion for the pursuit of facts::: science::: truth and unity over the last 6 months::: you‚Äôve not yet failed to fail.  Close/convert in-person classes. Every day you delay makes that obvious right choice more elusive to your credit. And more importantly: the longer you delay::: the more lives you needlessly endanger.  This has all been obvious. This has all been mentioned to you. This has all been avoidable. Be a responsible part of society::: please.  - 1 (of many) of your concerned and disappointed alumni,As a current cu boulder student I actually am pleased with how my school has handled the pandemic. Some may disagree with me.... but we are doing better than most schools. I have a friend at Appalachian state and they don‚Äôt even have to get tested. And our cases are low in comparison to other large universities. Cu has much smaller numbers than schools like penn state::: ASU::: FSU::: Indiana::: UW Madison etc.,Doesn‚Äôt sound like quarantine to me given students are going to classes::: the rec center::: etc. If you want to make an impact switch to all virtual. Too much to ask?,Kinda of saw that coming.... but that tuition is too juicy and tempting....,CU it‚Äôs on you to do the right thing. That means now::: not waiting two weeks to be told to shut it down. Shame on you!,Love how you kick out students who have been making good choices out of their dorms. Obviously you had no plan.,How will this be enforced? How will you know where students are and go?,Are you going to give students refund ??

If even one of your students dies there'll be literal hell to pay (this is not a threat...from me::: more of an educated guess). #NotWorthIt #CollegeKidsAreS tillKIDS,How do you quarantine and attend in-person classes at the same time?,In Thailand::: all of University::: colleges::: school::: nersery are open studying since August::: 2020. Why we can do this is because of many reasons::: we always wear mask covering::: we have self little alcohol spray bottle. Our food such as rice and curry need spoon and fork. Some food like sandwiches need hands catching is very risky. All of our toilet::: there is always water cleaning not just paper which leaves a lot virus remain in touch. We protect ourselves by no blame to other but self desciplin. PARTY is not allowed by ourselves no need to wait for university to announce.,A part of the issue is the rent that needs to be paid by off-campus students. Most students signed leases long before the pandemic began. Two of my kids currently attend CU and we signed leases in Jan or Feb (which is actually quite late for lease-signing). Approximately 72% of CU students live off-campus::: which equates to over 25:::000 students. These students aren't even in class on campus and never have been::: as all of their classes have been online from the very first day of school. Neither of my kids (a sophomore and a senior) has ever had even one class on campus this fall. So CU can close down::: but the students will still be in town. If Boulder really wants all of these students to vacate Boulder::: start focusing on your city's landlords and encourage them to let students out of leases. Otherwise::: 25:::000 students will still be there because they actually live there and owe rent (and most of them owe rent all the way through July 2021). I'm assuming most of them still need to work to pay that rent.,‚ÄúQuarantine‚Äù,This is where CU shows their role in the community. Say good bye to South campus::: plan on paying for every Boulder PD directing traffic for game day. CU is not welcome in Boulder.,Please Close before Boulder has even more risk of covid taking off! This is no surprise.. CU didnt care at all about city of Boulder::: just about their bottom line,This makes no sense to me at all.,Virtually no risk to 20 to 40 year olds.,CU opened for the money and now they have to close. CU should have followed other Schools in the PAC 12 and offered online learning only. You have endangered the lives of Boulder residents by your decision to open the school. What were you even thinking::: on yeah I already answered that $$$$. IF I am not mistaken you were going to close after Thanksgiving anyway. So you have reached your goal early. Bring the students to campus::: have the virus spread to the students and staff and then send them home to spread the virus to others. Again what were you even thinking? This is the result of poor leadship from our new President who obviously is not concerned with the safety of students or faculty::: or the spread of a deadly virus. Mr Kennedy's only concern is money money money ... He was and is a terrible choice for President of the University and his first real chance to lead is a failure.,Charged full the tuition fee with Inferior service,Not a single comment on here as to the effect this population has had on the local residents. Our kids can‚Äôt go to school. 35:::000 children are taking all of their school online. Why? Because CU got to choose to bring thousands of reckless adults into town so they could attend classes in person and the school could justify exorbitant tuition costs. Those of you who are calling for CU to remain open - have you considered at all what effect this is having on the community at large? Thousands and thousands of parents who cannot work because their school-aged children need constant supervision with online schooling. If you think online English 101 is too much to ask of a college student::: try getting a first grader to sit at a computer and practice a spelling lesson.  CU is not a bubble. Their inaction affects all of us::: whether we‚Äôre affiliated with the university or not.,But::: they can attend in person classes::: labs etcü§î,Money over the communities health and saftey.. youre monsters.. you knew this would happen but you just had to get everyone's tuition locked in... hope all the admins at cu get sick,Yeah punish the students for your stupidity. Makes an insane amount of sense.,So they expect kids that were placed in an 80sq.ft room to stay in it for 2 weeks and not get depressed?,As a local resident and small business owner - and alumni - I am begging you to please move to online classes::: using the campus staff to help these students with access to food::: PCR testing across the board and supporting their transition home after quarantine. You have now seeded our entire city which is will have long-lasting damaging effects on our restaurants::: small businesses::: school and local economy. CU needs to step up and be the leader they say they are::: this has been an embarrassment and a completely derelict of duty.,Kind of glad I didnt choose to go here. You guys are handling COVID poorly::: take some noted from UIUC.,Not quarantine. ‚òπÔ∏è,Some people on campus are claiming that a student ahs been killed due to Covid 19...Is this True!

We need to stop the recent rise in positive COVID-19 cases immediately and you can help. We‚Äôre working with our partners in the city::: county and state to identify even more interventions that will stop the recent surge of COVID-19 cases in Boulder.  Read the full message to our CU Boulder community below:  COLORADO.EDU From the Chancellor - Spike in COVID-19 cases: Do your part to stop the spread,2020-09-15 03:16:07,Don't put these students in harms way due to the failed national strategy of Donald Trump and expect them to somehow perform better than professional sports teams with rigorous distancing and testing (i.e the bubble). Too much pressure::: be real::: go 100% online at 10% the cost until a vaccine has proven effective for 6mo minimum. #TakeCareOfBuffs,Yep - we're in the middle of a Casedemic all right (due to the mass application of a notoriously inaccurate test) for a flu with a 99.9% recovery rate and a death count in the US of under 10:::000 according to last week's revised figures by the CDC. The only number that matters is the death count - which is way below that of a standard flu season. This scamdemic is a ruse - it's entirely about the UN's Agenda 21 (See Rosa Koire's videos). The virus is the Trojan horse being used on a global scale to smuggle in a long list of economy and freedom wrecking measures drafted by the UN and World Economic Forum called the Great Reset (google Great Reset - World Economic Forum). Their website is VAST with an incredible level of detail about their ongoing assault to severely restrict our freedoms and basically control the world's governments under draconian new UN mandates. One hundred and ninety three other countries are under the same 24/7 media propaganda pushed by the UN and the World Economic Forum that we've been subjected to for the past six months. If you care about freedom and your basic Constitutional rights::: It's time to massively resist this hoax like the tens of thousands in London::: Berlin and Ireland have been doing for the past few weeks (Unless you're ok with being on the receiving end of the Gestapo tactics now being unleashed on the people of Australia)!,Maybe you shouldn't have opened campus....,Stop partying for starters,Yes Covid is on the rise on campus. These kids are not that sick though! I know several kids just finished their 14 day quarantine. Seems to be passing in the Greek system,Wow. Who could have seen this coming..... Oh wait. We all did and you opened campus any way. Greedy fools putting us all in danger.,Who cares if the number of cases goes up as long as the death and hospital rate keeps going down.,Seriously::: what were you thinking opening up campus amidst a pandemic?! Dorms and classrooms are literally the perfect storm for covid outbreaks! I actually was planning on going to Cu Boulder and rebuild my school life after a couple years of failure but the pandemic has put the kibosh on those plans until at least summer of 2021::: that is if we do everything right and get this under control. I cancelled multiple trips this year and made the decision to stay away from schools which involves crowded classrooms. Seeing the news of these outbreaks and the parties being thrown by young morons convinced me I made the right decision. I really want to go to CU Boulder but it is NOT safe with this virus. I expect classes to go online only by October.,Misleading and controlled data is not helping anything. Multiply these numbers by 10 fold. Very sad situation::: considering this is a teaching institution. Get the politics out of it.,Joyce Barish Egan,or maybe like....close campus? So we can actually stop the spread?,I‚Äôm wondering why Wardenburg isn‚Äôt open on the weekends. If a student gets sick::: they have to hunt down medical assistance in town and possibly spread it to the public. With a pandemic happening::: it makes sense for Wardenburg to be open on the weekends.,Can flu shots be given in an outdoor area rather than the students going in to the health center or another building to receive a flu shot?,Hope he gets better soon.,Maybe you should ‚ú®close the school ‚ú®,Switch to online classes for goodness sake!,Poor leadership is what it is. The regents made a stupid mistake.,It's not deadly to healthy students. If you're unhealthy::: stay home. Pretty easy.,Quentin Whitfield Hannah Woodlee,I do know that a positive student‚Äôs case is counted in the students home state. Wonder if it‚Äôs counted at CU as well.,CU is doing a good job. Like colleges all over the country::: realization has set in that students are young people who won‚Äôt necessarily follow the rules.,At least 70% of your students live off campus because there is not enough housing for upper class men. Yet::: these are still your students spending $40:::000/year out of state to attend. How about testing them too? They are on campus for a variety of things. Wardenburg should absolutely be open on the weekend during this time. This all can‚Äôt be blamed on the kids. The university has to up their game.,Are we going to pretend that we didn't know that would happen? Remote learning is the future until the pandemic is over.,Thank you for your work and communication. It has been exemplary. We are grateful.,https:// www.nytimes.com/ interactive/ 2020/us/ covid-college-ca ses-tracker.htm l?campaign_id=9 &emc=edit_nn_20 200913&instance _id=22154&nl=th e-morning&regi_ id=129045119&se ction_index=1&s ection_name=big _story&segment_ id=37970&te=1&u ser_id=0940863c 374fc5f1c5d24ec 943a1efa4,SNITCH on those parties!!!,"Hi Tiffany - yes the best option::: if you have not done so already is to report with the city by calling non-emergency dispatch at 303-441-4444. More information can be found at https:// bouldercolorado. gov/ coronavirus-faqs. You can also submit an incident report with Student Conduct & Conflict Resolution via https:// cm.maxient.com/ reportingform.ph p?UnivofColorad o&layout_id=2. You can't file a complaint without telling them everything about you. Literally your entire background! Do the right thing and shut it down! These kids don't care either. II heard a girl with a huge group say::: ""he won't sleep with me because he tested positive::: but that just pisses me off because it's not like I'm going to get. He's such an ass."" Your kids are not our future! They're a disaster!",Do you really expect a bunch of teens and twenty somethings to care about a virus that they likely won‚Äôt even know they have unless they get tested!?! We have to understand that while it is relatively easy for us older adults to stay home and hang out with our families these young adults are in a stage of life where socializing is paramount. They‚Äôre forming relationships that will last the rest of their lives::: finding their potential spouses::: etc. They‚Äôre not going to suspend their lives because there‚Äôs some abstract risk a boomer with COPD might die if they go out partying with their friends!?! It‚Äôs unreasonable for society to ask them to in my opinion.,Keep the student health clinic open on weekends allowing for quicker access to antigen and PCR testing. A pandemic isn‚Äôt limited to Monday - Friday 9 to 5 hours. Hire more contact tracers that work specifically with and for CU. Once a student in student housing or even off campus has a confirmed positive a contact tracer needs to immediately begin the process of identifying and contacting all known close contacts. That‚Äôs how contacting tracing is effective. These basic interventions need to be truly rigorous. Seek out guidance from similar sized public universities that are seeing fewer numbers. If any actions are being decided with more concern for PR image rather than best practices for Public health then it will be impossible to slow and or stop the increasing spread.,SHUT IT DOWN!,Cu::: thanks for the update. CU has done a fantastic job and your freshmen students seem to be more mature in handling things compared to every other large university out there. My son is from VA and our state schools have high Covid numbers and Some have sent freshmen home. What do the parents of students in Greek life expect?the kids who live in frats and sororities are exacerbating the problem. The Greek system should have suspended rush::: etc... but they plowed ahead.,I've literally talked to them three times. They told me to just contact the city. They do not care!! If you live off campus I'm calling the cops every time I see gatherings::: hear any yelling::: fireworks::: gun shots::: speeding. So the truth behind it is::: the school does not give a shit!! They just want your money! None of the links worked. Literally only the cops number worked out of 4 sites they gave me. Yeah::: y'all won't see my kid next year!,Everyone knew bringing students back to campus would lead to more cases and you did it anyways. Blood is on your hands,These kids are unfortunately not educated yet. Smart::: but not as educated as their elders are. What do you expect? They are college students. In my opinion campus should have never opened and had strict guidelines from the start. Yes::: it‚Äôs hard to have that guidance during a pandemic::: but I wish this is the option and route that was taken and maybe this outcome wouldn‚Äôt have been this bad?,Lisa::: I‚Äôm really sorry. Praying for his quick and full return to health and for his parent‚Äôs peace.,Maybe you shouldn‚Äôt have let kids go to the dorms but you just wanted the money from them::: you don‚Äôt care about their health.,I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the dorms and classrooms of mask wearers but the off campus social activities of many young and old üôÇ people that‚Äôs have elevators the uptick in cases. Those that would blame Cu and not the actions of these individuals I question,Richard Mlnarik,This tepid response is unacceptable. I‚Äôve been hearing about the student parties for months. The university is nit being a good neighbor.The local economy has been devastated as have many loves. Children can‚Äôt return to school. May have died horrible deaths and survivors disabled. Do better.,According to your data on the COVID19 dashboard you have a 30% infection rate!! 77 infections from 240 tests::: easy math! That is higher than any numbers even in FL::: AZ and TX::: at what point are you going to say this is unacceptable and shut the college down? This doesn't even include students who are having to go off campus to get a test done. I think you have a responsibility to the students::: families and our community::: you are not being transparent about what is going on::: you are putting at risk our whole community! I can't imagine why you thought allowing the Frats and Sororities to open was a good idea::: they are just super spreaders.,New Mexico has imposed the 14 day quarantine again. There really is no excuse for this. People have been complaining about students partying since May. And it went on all summer. Now the entire state is impacted. BVSD students learning::: too. It is irresponsible to have let it go on so long.,Thanks for educating our kids safely. CU boulder number so much better than every state university in our surrounding 4 states. Very few state universities are doing waste water testing and saliva testing. CU low numbers I am sure are the direct result of it.,Andy Dufresne,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our CU Boulder testing::: contact tracing and Boulder County Public Health (BCPH) collaborations alerted us this morning to a potential increase in positive COVID-19 cases among our on and off-campus students.  We are concerned with this likely increase in positive cases over the past 24 hours::: and we anticipate the increase in confirmed positive cases will continue through the remainder of the week.  We expected spikes like this might occur and have planned for this possibility. As we did during the increase in off-campus cases earlier this summer::: we are rapidly employing our testing::: contact tracing and isolation protocols in partnership with BCPH to contain the potential for community spread.  The next few days will be critical to our ability to maintain our current operating status. It is imperative that we all continue to follow public health orders::: avoid large gatherings::: wear masks and practice physical distancing.  The measures we have put into place ‚Äî wastewater monitoring::: surveillance and diagnostic testing::: contact tracing and isolation ‚Äî have been working to help us identify potential outbreaks early::: minimize the risk of community spread and care for our infected students.

My son goes out for walks or meets up with hometown friends that are at CU but says he's given up on making new friends. üò• I encouraged him to not give up::: but it's a lot of pressure on kids especially those away from home for the first time to initiate interactions when none of the typical social opportunities is available. CU::: please do more and do better to provide fun in-person opportunities for kids to socialize safely. Thank you for coming to my Ted talk. üòÅ And go Buffs!,Why did you open?!?!,The crisis has created 1000 little despots. Nice to meet you::: Akirah!,The email sent to the students: Dear Students:::  For many of us::: the excitement of starting a new academic year has also brought a level of uncertainty and stress as we continue to navigate around a global pandemic. To our students who are following health and safety protocols::: thank you! I know it‚Äôs been challenging as we reunite with friends and classmates. I appreciate your ongoing decision to do the right thing by wearing a face covering::: avoiding large gatherings and keeping each other safe.  To those of you who are choosing to disregard health and safety guidelines::: this is a formal notice. This reckless behavior is putting the campus experience and everyone‚Äôs health at risk. Therefore::: I want to make sure you are aware of the potential impacts to your educational experience. If you violate a public health order and the violation is connected to attending a party::: you will be excluded from campus for at least two weeks and you may be suspended. Multiple violations will result in suspension::: which means you‚Äôll be automatically withdrawn from classes and barred from access to campus resources.  Violations and sanctions If you are caught hosting or attending a party or large gathering on or off campus that violates a public health order::: you will be at a minimum:  Excluded from campus for two weeks. You will need to make arrangements to participate in your classes remotely. Placed on probation::: which impacts your ability to study abroad or attend graduate school. Required to participate in educational sanctions::: which will provide you additional information on following public health orders in the future. Multiple or severe violations will result in suspension from CU Boulder for a minimum of one semester.  If you are in a leadership position of an off-campus organization that hosts a party::: you may also be charged with aiding and abetting in other individuals‚Äô violations of public health orders in addition to facing the above sanctions.  If you have been excluded from campus and are found violating the exclusion::: the CU Police Department can issue a criminal trespass ticket and you will likely be suspended.  The city of Boulder and landlords also may take action against violators.  How to report We cannot take action without formal complaints and individual names being shared. If you witness an incident or other concerning behavior that puts public health at risk::: please report it to our conduct office. You must include a name and as much information as possible for us to be able to take action.  Help keep campus open Being a Buff means looking out for each other. And that includes making decisions that help prevent the spread of COVID-19.  Again::: I want to thank the majority of our students who are following public health orders and engaging in safe behaviors. We have amazing students on this campus and we appreciate all that you are doing to keep the campus safe.  Remember: you are a Buff wherever you are. Let‚Äôs work together to make this semester successful for everyone.  Sincerely:::  Akirah J. Bradley::: EdD Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs,You should be patrolling Farrand Field - it's full of non-mask wearers and little social distancing!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Even here in Europe. Demonstrate your integrity. Spell out ALL the conditions necessary to return to a normal life that we ALL can vote on.

Some schools (Univ of IL Urbana) are testing 2x/week‚Ä¶ From the NPR article...""And::: why two tests per week?

But::: if they're tested again a few days later::: the virus would likely be detected. ""So::: by testing frequently the chances of catching that person when their viral load goes up is very high:::"" Burke says.""  I also think that the 2x/week testing can have a ‚Äúpositive‚Äù psychological effect of adhering to social distancing and wearing masks.

CU is doing the same thing with this app::: daily::: which is exactly what hospitals do::: and it is more responsible than anything else. Rather than hating on CU::: be proud that they are implementing proper protocol. And Go Buffs::: have some pride for your Alma Mater.,What about the asymptomatic ppl that don‚Äôt even know they have it . That is the problem. And can infect many staff and students and they might not even know they are infected. You need to do rapid testing for students. Or we see a big problems in the university and at boulder university,A form filled out by 30+ thousand people a day will be unmanageable and unenforceable.,As a current student going into my senior year::: I also don‚Äôt think we should have in-person classes. However::: since I am a pre-nursing student I have to take Human Anatomy Lab this semester in order to graduate on time::: and that is a class that i refuse to take online. There are exceptions where online is completely incomparable to being in person. I cannot imagine not experiencing lab with a real cadaver::: and using an online application. There is no comparison! So I am very grateful that my campus is doing their best to make sure we have access to these very important in person classes.

As CU Boulder starts the next steps in its budget and fiscal planning process::: college and administrative units have been asked to plan for a 5% one-time general fund budget reduction.  The campus faces a general fund gap upwards of $120 million (13%) compared to last year. This planning target represents the most modest of the options that we believe can offset our losses.

Forever Buff Aaron LaMaskin was initially drawn to the anthropology field due to an interest in studying other cultures. However::: throughout his studies he realized that this was an outdated notion of the field. The new anthropology is more self-reflective::: aiming to understand history and how we interact with each other from contemporary points-of-view.  Aaron compared old and new by focusing on the collaborative process the Santa Fe Museum of Indian Arts and Culture has with Southwest Native peoples. What he found is that by including contemporary themes like ‚Äútrapdoors‚Äù in the exhibit::: the museum allows for different perspectives and takes on the same material::: fostering::: as LaMaskin puts it::: ideological accessibility.

COLORADO.EDU Fall 2020 Planning & Considerations for F-1 Students,2020-07-08 16:49:30,"https:// twitter.com/ myeshachou/ status/ 1280670088077676 546 ""Columbia and NYU creating a one-credit ‚Äúin-person‚Äù ‚Äúglobal course‚Äù for all international students to register for so they can‚Äôt be deported by ICE: absolutely iconic"". Why not make an in person attendance ""optional"" course? Seems like a good way to get around this..",I am strongly opposed to in person classes this fall. However::: I would be happy to see an exception for these students. Our government's failures are ruining so many people's lives. It is criminal.,Internacional students around the world will go to Europe or Asia in the future with this kind of policies..... no more money in tuition::: rent::: etc....,Do a one credit ‚Äúin person‚Äù course so these students can stay in the US! NYU and Berkeley are doing it! Be the change CU!,I want in person classes - video all classes - give everyone a choice - those who don‚Äôt keep your child home -,Way to go CU!!!!!!‚ù§Ô∏è,And what about all of the incoming international students? They are automatically cancelled since they can‚Äôt be there before the beginning of the semester due to travel restrictions. Goodbye to all of them::: apparently.,As if the colleges::: universities::: students (international and the like) and professors don‚Äôt have enough to worry about!! This country and their PATHETIC leadership should be ashamed of themselves. This is absolutely horrifying to me.,Can our universities realize the error of their ways. If you sanction rioting::: looting::: shooting::: defunding law enforcement and race baiting just because you are liberal or Black::: then vote for dems who have done nothing while they have over 500 years in office and are still there. Their puppet Biden alone has 47 years of uselessness.-\-\- -\-\-\-\However::: if you have a conscience::: really want jobs::: lower taxes::: safety and security without leftist government running your life::: then stop voting for dems who live in walled mansions with wealth they have bilked out of you forever. Thank you for::: at least::: real thought and compromise in November.,"Welp::: CU::: you wanted in-person classes despite all relevant medical advice. I hope you and your supporters enjoy the new ""college experience"" of lack of testing::: widespread illness::: international students getting deported::: and violating the ADA by compelling immunocompromis ed students::: faculty::: and staff (and their families by proxy) to attend or give in-person lectures. Your rich out of state masters must be SO proud.",I am happy you will try to help! All universities should do the same!,I sincerely hope we have in person classes this year. No reason to go all online!!,I‚Äôm an incoming freshman who has a learning disability and I wish there was flexibility with the system. In my opinion they shouldn‚Äôt just force everyone to do online but they shouldn‚Äôt force everything back on campus either. For students who have learning difficulties like me who has ADHD::: in person learning should be allowed. As well as people who are immunocompromis ed should be given the option to learn online. I have no clue why this is such an issue because online learning in the spring was a complete disaster and it had a negative affect on students with learning disabilities and students who don‚Äôt have good internet access. Please let people take in person classes at their own risk with their consent and give students the option to choose which way they learn! Flexibility is the answer!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Trump is no longer president of the United States. By having no constructive response to any of the monumental crises now convulsing America::: Trump has abdicated his office. He is not governing. He‚Äôs golfing::: watching cable TV::: and tweeting. He has incited more police violence. Trump called the protesters ‚Äúthugs‚Äù and threatened to have them shot. More than 41 million Americans are jobless. In the coming weeks temporary eviction moratoriums are set to end in half of the states. One-fifth of Americans missed rent payments this month. Extra unemployment benefits are set to expire at the end of July. The Democratic-led House passed a $3 trillion relief package on May 15. Mitch McConnell has recessed the Senate without taking action and Trump calls the bill dead on arrival. The House has passed nearly 400 bills this term::: including measures to reduce climate change::: enhance election security::: require background checks on gun sales::: reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act and reform campaign finance. All are languishing in McConnell‚Äôs inbox. Trump doesn‚Äôt seem to be aware of any of them. There is nothing inherently wrong with golfing::: watching television and tweeting. But if that‚Äôs pretty much all that a president does when the nation is engulfed in crises::: he is not a president. Trump‚Äôs tweets are no substitute for governing. They are mostly about getting even.‚Äù ‚Äì Robert Reich  The large presence of the U.S. military security forces in D.C. reflects Donald J.

Dear faculty::: staff and students:  Boulder County Public Health (BCPH) today announced 17 recent positive cases of COVID-19 in our community::: many involving CU Boulder students. According to disease investigators::: some cases are related to parties that occurred in the University Hill area from May 25 to June 4. Other cases are related to a protest march in Boulder on June 5::: the virus spreading among roommates::: individuals who recently traveled and other reasons.  First::: we ask that any CU Boulder community members with connections to the identified events review guidance from BCPH. Students can utilize campus Medical Services at Wardenburg Health Center to get tested or contact their primary care physician. Services through Wardenburg Health Center are confidential.  Second::: these positive cases demonstrate the vital importance of every one of us following public health guidance. Noncompliance has serious consequences and places our entire community and our ability to deliver our educational mission at risk.  Our university is doing its part to enable students to return to campus this fall. We will have testing. We will have contact tracing. We will have personal protective equipment. We are making our classrooms::: facilities and residence halls as safe as possible. Our faculty and staff have been working around the clock to update our courses and instructional approaches to enable students safely back on campus.  This concentration of cases could have likely been prevented if those involved ‚Äî particularly those hosting and attending parties ‚Äî had followed public health orders. We all need to live up to our responsibilities::: as some students are putting their own health and their own and other students‚Äô on-campus educational opportunities in jeopardy by engaging in behaviors that imperil the health and safety of our entire community. We are prioritizing the health and safety of our campus and the community. We will not stand idly by if students are unable or unwilling to meet their obligations. This includes educating students::: referring those who may have violated public health orders and university policies to a student conduct process and working with local public health officials to ensure that our campus and community's health is not compromised by the actions of a few.  We acknowledge the reality that living with COVID-19 means there will be positive cases::: which is why we have a detailed plan to mitigate the risks. During March::: April and May::: our campus increased communications with students about why and how to comply with state::: county and city orders. We will continue to step up these communications and other measures throughout the summer and fall::: including:  - Instructing campus community members that they must follow all public health orders::: including strict limits for any public or private gatherings  - Updating the Student Code of Conduct to reflect the necessity for behaviors that promote health and safety during the COVID-19 pandemic. This applies on and off campus and will include educational efforts and appropriate sanctions for non-compliance with public health orders.  - Adopting mandatory training for students::: faculty and staff that includes instruction on physical distancing::: wearing face coverings::: hand hygiene and sanitation.  - Collaborating with BCPH::: the City of Boulder and others to comprehensively address how a combination of increased public education and direct outreach::: along with enforcement measures::: can combine to influence the choices made in our community.  - Working with students::: faculty and staff who become infected or exposed to engage in contact tracing to prevent the further spread of the virus.  This plan will only work and we will only be able to stay safe this summer and successfully return to campus this fall if every member of our community fully embraces their individual responsibilities to keep themselves and others healthy.  We must all do our part to respect each other and keep each other safe. We must not endanger each other with behaviors that do not live up to the values of our Colorado Creed.  CU Boulder will do its part. We ask each person in our community to do theirs.

Even if you remain somehow unconcerned for student prognosis (there are other negative outcomes than death)::: know that students interact with an entire community. Some students commute from home. Some students live off-campus. Some students actually leave campus from time to time. Many faculty and staff are vulnerable. This is not just a student issue::: this is a community issue.

I can't now complain about paying high tuition and expect the university to change their rates due to my choice. I don't believe it is realistic to expect the university to solve all the Covid 19 issues or risks. They will not be able to force some to wear masks if the person chooses not to.

Step 1: Create a vaccine for COVID-19. Step 2: Distribute it across the world. The question remains::: how do you distribute the vaccine to 7.8 billion people? A team of CU Boulder researchers are working to build a pilot-scale system capable of producing 10:::000 to 100:::000 doses of COVID-19 vaccines per run that would be ready for use as human trials of vaccines begin in the next year.  COLORADO.EDU Why developing a successful COVID-19 vaccine is only half the battle,2020-06-09 20:43:35,I dont want it so theres 1 you can subtract,The vaccine will kill more than died from virus just like all vaccines. Not gonna be one of those will never take a vaccine,Perhaps there are other questions to be asked/answered before we get to Step 2...,As a former CU student I‚Äôm ashamed to see this groveling acceptance of non-Doctor Gate‚Äôs ‚Äúsolution‚Äù to this overblown hoax. Check the statistics - the fatality rates are lower than the 2017 flu season. And today New Zealand declared itself ‚ÄúCoronavirus free.‚Äù More critical thinking::: less blind obedience to a billionaire‚Äôs shady agenda is what‚Äôs needed. Of all places::: Boulder should be leading the charge against these draconian lockdowns::: Stalinist social-distanci ng measures::: and the fascist mind-control masking of the world. BTW - masks force you to re-breathe the viral loads your body expels during the day::: thereby depressing the immune system. They also do nothing to protect you from airborne germs - germs easily pass through them like they're not even there.,Doubt it will be 7.8 billion. I am all for vaccines but There is NO WAY you are putting a vaccine in me or my children that does not have a track record.,Stupid. No one cares .its is as bad as the flu. You're a smart College do the math,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When will we hear back about the racist actions by multiple students that have been reported to the OIEC?,Chicago: 18 murders in 24 hours. Where is the outrage? Only a strategic subset of black lives appears to matter. https:// chicago.suntimes .com/crime/ 2020/6/8/ 21281998/ chicago-violence -murder-history -homicide-polic e-crime?fbclid= IwAR0P2_F3c_hT0 hOk0M_060QbrZKv ZXZ3B2nz5dcoE_b bphFf4KYlJmPjxv Q#,Sara Skuladottir,You're a big part of the problem CU Boulder.

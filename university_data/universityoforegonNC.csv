Weekend Read: “If a climate skeptic is unpersuaded by the evidence that is already available to them today::: my model implies that they will likely remain a skeptic for many years into future. Their prior beliefs are so strong that even decades of continued warming may not be enough to convince them.”  AROUND.UOREGON.EDU Climate skeptics are not easily persuaded::: UO study shows,2021-06-06 15:36:00,This is obviously true::: so much so I laughed out loud reading this headline. I will say I was once skeptical::: but came around::: as the data is pretty obvious. The climate is warming.,Nobody denies that there is climate change. It has been doing that since the beginning of time and that's because this is still God's world. Better to have signs that follow Him and quit killing babies::: having riots::: teaching little ones about sex. Instead carry signs making right again instead of wrong being right and right being wrong. Truthfully I have a hard time seeing all those carrying signs and spending so much time on our streets trying to convince others of their beliefs as your normal hard working people. Where do they find the time and how to they get the time off work or school? I am sure a lot of them are on welfare::: unemployment and any other incomes that our country gives them.,LOL. This applies to almost everyone on any side of any issue in our techno echo-chambered world. There’s ample study on the phenomenon of deliberate ignorance—how the Information Age has had the complete opposite effect on knowledge than expected.,101 in Gillette Wy yesterday! Not normal! I could go on! Global warming and climate change is a very real thing ! I lived in California for years it use to rain much more ::: not so many fires. It’s changed a lot.,that's why I'm not optimistic for the future of humans,Yeah..let's just keep the page to all things sports. Leave the politics at the door.,Yes climate change is happening::: it's the cycle of the planet. Tell me again how taxing the crap out of US citizens will stop or even slow this. Asia is the largest polluter on the planet::: do something about that and then maybe you would get others to listen.,No such thing the earth has warmed up and cooled down since the beginning of time.,We will not stop the earth from doing it's thing. So be good people and stop playing God.,The sign alone::: wood handle::: paint/ink of some sort::: on cardboard - all did not come from outer space and therefore impacted the environment in a negative way. Her glasses::: hair tie::: earrings::: clothes::: etc also were harvested from earth with gas guzzling equipment and trucks to get it to her so she could buy it in on Amazon or a bricks and mortar store. She’s contributing to the very thing she is protesting::: and so is everyone else in the photo.,You guys been keeping track for 5 million years? If not you have no real credibility.,Don't worry about climate. Corrupt Politicians will destroy our world way before any climate problems.,It is not called global warming anymore as some places are cooler::: some warmer and some unchanged. A cooling environment has different cause and cure than a warming one so that would seem problematic😂😂 a cure for warming would be to pump particulates into the atmosphere which would reflect the suns heat and cause cooling::: a volcano that is huge or a nuclear war would do it....ever hear of nuclear winter😂😂,“When even the brightest mind in our world has been trained up from childhood in a superstition of any kind::: it will never be possible for that mind::: in its maturity::: to examine sincerely::: dispassionately ::: and conscientiously any evidence or any circumstance which shall seem to cast a doubt upon the validity of that superstition. I doubt if I could do it myself.” - Mark Twain,I cannot give any scientist of any age better advice than this: the intensity of a conviction that a hypothesis is true has no bearing on whether it is true. The importance of the strength of our conviction is only to provide a proportionately strong incentive to find out if the hypothesis will stand up to critical examination. - Peter B. Medawar::: zoologist and immunologist::: Advice to a Young Scientist::: 1979,Rumor has it that this will be the next push by the media.,I just came here to hear from all the Facebook climatologists.,If it cannot be questioned::: it is not science::: it is religion.,STFU!!!,My little boy wants to be a Duck so badly::: but I can't see how a degree in virtue signaling is going to benefit him. Maybe you should focus on academia instead of socialism. You're embarrassing yourselves.,where is the outrage over countries like china dumping garbage barges into the oceans,https:// www.theguardian. com/ environment/ 2015/jul/08/ exxon-climate-ch ange-1981-clima te-denier-fundi ng,Keep studyin...,The earth is coming out of an ice age and will eventually be lots warmer. It’s evolution and it can not be stopped. Why? It’s the sun yep all the time and money wasted on stopping global warming is lining the pockets of the top 1% and doing nothing at all to stop global warming. The Evidence is evolution as they are pointing an accusing finger at you. While they pollute the earth with aluminum bi products and our oceans with trash::: they point the finger at you. Wake up America. There is no medium setting for the earth making it last forever. Do the research and see that a small section of the sun hitting the earth does more climate warming damage than all of the people of the worlds emissions put together. But sheep will be sheep::: and do what all the other sheep do.. so pathetic. Evolution is not a crisis it is reality. Nothing would change if we stopped all emissions and just sat and waited to die. The opposition is not in denial YOU are.,No Carbon Tax is ever going to fix climate change. The only thing that will do. Is line big government pockets. Off the working classes backs. You want real change. We need a separation of Science and government. As long as government is funding Science. We will never have real Science.,After the wuhan fiasco::: “skeptic” should be worn as a badge of honor.,Oh brother. 🙄,Hmmm. How many of these climate change fanatics also believe in more than 2 genders even though FACTS AND BIOLOGY say differently 🤔 or the fact that life begins at conception witch makes abortion murder. Funny how these facts are always pushed off to the side because they are inconvenient,"Someone who challenges science is called a scientist. Challenging and testing theories and hypothesises is the very foundation of science.  People who challenge religions are called skeptics. The fact that left wing activists call those who challenge the narrative about global warming ""climate skeptics""::: betrays the fact they are not having a rational argument::: they are condemning heretics who offended their religious beliefs.",Well::: duh!,"I think the expression is ""you can't fix stupid""",Check an almanac!!,China = 30% of total global carbon emissions. US = 15% of total carbon emissions. Take your message to Xi. I’m sure he would love to hear from you 😜,"""Our propaganda is just not working::: some people still disagree with us""",Oregon (14) vs. (Gonzaga / LSU) http:// network-4k.site/ ncaa.php,BS:::LAST 60 YRS TEMP THE SAME GLOBAL WIDE:::REAL SCIENTIST STATED.LOOK AT PREVIOUS RECORDS.U HAVE CYCLES 2 WEATHER.,I like your segregation sign for vaccinated people versus non-vaccinated people that's real cute,Yeah it's a river in Egypt,Climate change....winte r cold...summer hot,Please do not feed the trolls.,And if it wasn't for global warming::: your liberal college would be under 100ft of ice!,Climate change is natural

Thanks!,It’s sad our 2021 graduates do not get a graduation with parents but yet UO will have a NCAA track and field with fans😡,Trust me::: I have heard of some parents contacting multiple people at the university telling them that they better have a place for the parents because we are coming. Hope to see you there!,So pissed at UO. Terribly unfair to the Class of 2021. Show a Vaccine Card and attend NCAA events but deny students and parents live graduation??? And they just INCREASED seating capacity at new stadium yesterday for Vaxxed ticket holders???,I was wondering the same::: how can that be?

Do they qualify?,Segregation is wrong. Your new policies mean many of us just gave up on the Ducks.,So does this mean Lane county expects to allow fans this fall??,This is embarrassing.

Still eligible?,FFS you guys will bribe with anything to bring out the idiots::: won't ya.,Nothing like bribing people to take this vaccine... sad

You can hold the track meet for thousands of people from all over::: but cannot figure out commencement? Was it too much work? Who is the virtual commencement speaker? Did you figure it was cheaper not to hold it? Did you even try to use Autzen? Was it they would have to cancel a few practice days?

"One year after George Floyd's murder::: the UO is marking a ""Day of Enlightenment."" Learn more: https://fal.cn/3fCKS",2021-05-25 16:47:57,I find many comments on this thread appalling and ignorant. This is not “George Floyd” day::: but clearly many didn’t even bother to notice that it’s not (nor is it being advertised as such). Also appalling and ignorant is the repeatedly made point that George Floyd led a less than perfect life and does not deserve attention. No one is lifting him up as a hero. But the racism is still speaking loud and clear in many of these comments::: and those commenters are exactly the people who need to participate in the Day of Enlightment that UO has posted about here.,Of course he didn’t deserve to die. But stop acting like he was a good person.,Dude was on Fentinal… drugs are bad. He just got done robbing someone. I’m sorry but if I was a crack head white guy my name would not be known. Let’s be real,The story of Floyd is a mixed bag. His death was tragic but his own personal life wasn’t anything to parade about. Instead it was full of violence and dope addiction. Hopefully necessary police changes and reform will happen but foisting him as some type of folk hero is irrational.,So do we sit around and pop a pill or? I don't think he should die for what he did but the attention directed at him needs to stop. Stuff like murals.,Ehh::: how about ‘mourning’ instead of ‘enlightenment’ ?,Good Grief,University of Oregon. This kind of crap is why I stopped donating… just sayin.,That painting is a lie. He still can't breath. From the 1st time he said it before they even put handcuffs on him till now. He can't breath.,Thank you UO!

I don’t think so. Does he need to be worshipped like a martyr? Hell no.,more propaganda from UO,I love all the illiterate jackasses that get triggered into posting their hot takes by a picture of George Floyd. I don't know::: maybe read the article before you spout your stupid 'BUt hE WaS On FenTanyl' talking points? I imagine you all making the incredulous 'Tucker Carlson' face whilst writing your inane comments.,Now we glorify friminals?,Quit honoring a career criminal that was gonna die anyway cuz he took to much fentanyl,Too bad George Floyd didn't even die yeah he's a 3rd degree Freemason and if you can talk you can breathe everybody should know that but he didn't die wake up stupid

Earliest: watching Burleson and Grelle go for 4:00 when I was 9.,The car headlights lighting up the infield.,Worlds first 16 foot pole vault by Bob seagren... pre running down the wsu Kenya runner in 1500 meters in tge stretch.dave wottle winning men's 800 at Olympic trials.. the great dual meets between oregon and ucla,Back in 1968 or 69 when Coach Bowerman first organized the Twilight Meet he planned a 4-mile relay challenge. He had so many good milers he thought they could challenge each other and go after the world record. Well::: half way through the race one team was so far ahead of the other that Bowerman switched teams and moved two of the fastest runners from one team to the other. Sure enough the quartet of runners set the 4-mile world record but because of the switch in the middle of the race the world record was not allowed. The 4 milers were Roscoe Divine::: Dave Wilborn::: Wade Bell and my memory escapes me as to who the fourth runner was. But it was certainly fun to watch.,Watching Jerry Tarr run hurdles. He was something special.

The University of Oregon will require students::: faculty and staff who will be on campus to receive a COVID-19 vaccination prior to the start of the fall 2021 term.

Requiring COVID-19 vaccines will allow our campus community to return to the on-campus experience that is the cornerstone of academic success::: student experience and research innovation. For more information about the vaccination requirement::: go to the UO vaccine website.  More information is available at: https://fal.cn/3fhMD,2021-05-10 21:03:20,Thank you!

I did nazi that coming!,Several of these commenters have never had to conduct scientific research or written a scientific research paper and it shows. Thank you UofO for trying to get back to normalcy.,Why not require it now or provide a negative test for graduation? Other schools are doing it! If this is the only way I can see our only child graduate::: then I guess I don’t have a choice::: do I? Oh never mind::: parents can’t be in attendance. There are no words to describe how disappointing it is to know UO couldn’t arrive at a safe solution to allow kids to walk and their families be present. Somehow other universities figured it out.,Leave it to the comment section to absolutely ruin my faith in humanity::: thank you UO for making a sensible decision for what honestly feels like the first time in awhile,Thank you U of O. We are an incoming First Year Student family and this is very important and welcome news for our family. Thank you for prioritizing the health of our students and the entire UO community.

Great decision!,I have two Ducks::: our family is vaccinated and ready to return to in-person school this Fall.,Good decision but it will without a doubt lower fall 21 enrollment.,Yes::: sanity science::: triumphs over unbridled individualism and selfishness.,You have no right to force people to be vaccinated.

Thank you::: Thank you::: Thank you!  As for all the people griping about this one...

Mine just wouldn’t attend and adhere to this illegal force tactic!!! Not worth the risk.,Every public place should do the same!,Never going to get the vaccine.,How can you require something that is only approved for emergency use? 🤔,As an UO community member (ID card) UO Alumni Association member::: and Oregon Ducks football season ticket holder for 20 years::: I applaud this decision to require a COVID 19 vaccination.

Go Ducks!,Thanks for taking away our freedom of choice and jumping on the vaccine bandwagon.,Absolutely ridiculous.

The students deserve this💗💗💗,U of O’s grad parade is the best! Hope they can keep it going.,Was happy to hear about the grad parade but this is unbelievable. Not ok to have an in person football game for 8:::000 spectators and won’t have an in person graduation for 8:::000 graduates and their families. And no reason why UO can’t do in person ceremonies over a course of two weeks or two weekends for all graduates like USC and SDSU are doing. Is this a logistical planning issue or perhaps a budget issue? What is it? Many other colleges are holding in person graduations. C’mon University of Oregon make this right for all the graduates.  https:// www.google.com/ amp/ www.kezi.com/ templates/ AMP%3fcontentID= 574232691?fbcli d=IwAR1PMGMmFMp OQaW7-FGBdO4MZe r_FutnYl79Ln2Z9 iv_2tWbSSPAJ2eL Ly0,My husband and I are grads.

These large scale events were assembled within weeks::: while UO's smaller programs continue to be resigned to virtual events::: if anything. If UO feels comfortable managing an in-person ceremony made of thousands of undergraduate students::: it should take the initiative to host a similar in-person ceremony for its smaller programs such as the JD::: LLM::: and CRES graduate programs.

The UO is carefully assessing new COVID-19 guidance from the Oregon Health Authority that reduces restrictions for outdoor recreation and events.  We are exploring how this decision affects commencement::: and how we might be able to add an in-person activity to our previously announced commencement plans.  While we are encouraged by the improving conditions related to COVID-19::: the safety of our entire community remains our highest priority and a guiding principle as we navigate moving operations in and out of different risk levels. Read more on our commencement site: https://fal.cn/3e6LO,2021-03-18 20:33:03,University of Oregon so many colleges are announcing in-person outdoor graduation ceremonies. We really hope UO will follow suit. Colleges are spreading the ceremonies over a week or two for the class of 2021. I know the class of 2020 didn’t get an in person graduation so hopefully UO will be able to do something for this class another time if the covid social distance guidelines do not permit having both classes together this June.,University of Oregon please keep in mind many parents have already changed plans. The hotels are sold out for the Olympic trials starting that next week. Keeping the 12th as a possible date would be great for families that are still coming. So happy this is being reconsidered.,How soon will we know? The Graduation announcements have a link line for us to write the virtual link . When will that be given so announcements can be sent? The hotel and airbnb rates are skyrocketing::: hopefully you will let us know soon so we can change plans or make adjustments.,Please do the right thing and let these kids walk. Vaccines will be available to all in May. We need to value education as much as sporting events.,What about those of us that didn’t get to walk last year? Do we not count?,As the father of a 2021 soon to be graduate::: I would like to appeal to the University to reconsider their decision to hold a virtual graduation. These young people have worked hard and deserve recognition for their achievements. For most this will be their last graduation and time with their classmates. The powers to be should work just as hard to organize a safe and memorable graduation. Here is a thought. You utilize Autzen::: Mathew Knight Arena::: and Hayward field to safely “socially distance” the students and their limited friends and family in attendance. You stream the commencement address and various speakers from the student union to the stadium scoreboards or PA system. Afterwards::: the students walk to the stage hand their pre written graduation card which phonetically spells their name and the degree (s) they earned to an official who reads it over the local PA system and they receive their replica diploma. All this can be achieved with masks on and ample social distance.  Please don’t tell me this is about limiting people coming to Eugene during the pandemic. If that were true::: the Olympic trials would be cancelled as well. PLEASE do what is right and recognize these young people. They have already lost a year and a half of their college years. At the very least show them you are willing to work for them and celebrate them. Parents please join me in reposting this message or creating support on other platforms.,This is the best news of 2021 !!!! Isais Lawrence ......,👍🏻😊,That’s great news! 🙏🏽 Liz Santoyo Pedregon

How ever when school is in session there is a serious lack of accessible handicap parking. For those who do not use a wheelchair but cannot walk far::: that makes it extremely difficult to get around campus.,Hmmm I hope this is actually true. I had a daily problem trying to find wheelchair accessible parking that wasn’t for “visitors only” in 2012. Even in campus housing parking lots. It sent the message that disabled people visit::: but disabled students and staff don’t exist- not to mention it violated ADA.  After several unhelpful meetings with AEC::: the department dean::: and the director of parking::: I finally had to submit a disability discrimination complaint to the Dept of Justice Office of Civil Rights. UO was found to be in violation of ADA::: which lead to the university having to revamp the accessible parking across campus. Too bad UO staff couldn’t just address the inequality themselves rather than having to involve OCR.,Inclusivity for physical disabilities is a great start. Now it's long past time for supportive campus adaptations for the mental health needs of students.,As a wheelchair user and alumni::: (class of 2009) thank you for addressing this.

This is the first I'm reading of the poor::: unacceptable treatment of this year's Freshman class.

We will still find a way to celebrate the incredible accomplishment our daughter has made::: especially considering navigating a pandemic::: forest fires::: etc. while 30 hours from home::: but UO has provided nothing but disappointment throughout this entire pandemic.",I am a parent of a UO student and think that if you can host an Olympic gathering at UO with many athletes there trying out...you should have other creative ideas and options in hosting a socially distanced graduation ceremony. We pay hefty tuition fees for students to attend in order for the school to pick and choose which events are “safe” and “unsafe” due to COVID. It doesn’t seem right!  You have so much space on your campus in order to plan an effective safe environment for the ceremony. If some students choose not to participate::: then that’s their decision. You should allow those that want a ceremony to attend. You should create this type of environment. There’s plenty of space and time in order to accomplish this!,What a big disappointment for all the graduates and their families.,Glad our daughter graduated in June.

Or at least create in-person::: and socially distanced ceremonies in different locations by major::: with only students attending live?

You’ve earned your degree to the fullest and I hope you find a way to celebrate this achievement 💖,University of Oregon this was your reply to me about the Olympic event: “The Oregon Health Authority's statewide orders currently do not allow outdoor gatherings of more than 50 people. These events take months to plan::: and we had to make the difficult decision now like many other universities. We are disappointed as well. We hope you will join us virtually and at an in-person celebration when it is safe to do so.”  My question to you is... May I ask how you are hosting the Olympics? Will there be a gathering of less than 50?  This question was posed since the day this was posted on fb and I still have not received a reply...,This is beyond disappointing!

Get your priorities straight Oregon!

However::: it’s especially disappointing that the university hasn’t contacted 2020 graduates directly at all about this year’s ceremonies that we were invited back to and that social media was the way for us to find out..,The university has had a year now to figure it out and plan some thing planned something that’s going to be safe for the students and for the family members and friends gathering at the graduations you don’t have to be all together in one day that's a huge campus you could figure it out and break it up,We didn’t get a commencement last year::: and NOBODY gave a crap. 5000 students completing an incredible milestone.

Plenty of time to put this “yearly” event together as this is not your first rodeo. Shame on you Oregon. These kids have suffered enough. By June::: people will all be vaccinated. You could do a graduation for the kids and stream for the parents::: split up the graduation::: so many options but you decide to cancel. But wait...I can still purchase tickets for the trials which is within the same week of graduation. What a shame!!!,Why were 2020 seniors not contacted about this? If we were supposedly invited to this ceremony::: shouldn’t we also have the courtesy to know it’s cancelled?,Can you explain how the state requirements only allow groups of 25. So you decide to cancel graduation.

After wishing for years to get my children out of Oklahoma we were soooo excited our child was accepted to Oregon! We were prepared for covid protocols. But we couldn’t have begun to imagine our child being basically imprisoned in a tiny room in the worst dorm on campus::: no access to even leave to a library or study room::: zero access to use covid safety measures and have a few socially distanced study groups or even meet ANY other students! Has to eat a sack meal on her “meal plan” and the dorm has no cafeteria and a single microwave. And with exactly two people she gets to talk to -her roommate and the girl across the hall who is technically supposed to be a big no-no worthy of an RA write up- she still has to go for testing almost weekly! WTH? With NOBODY in the parking lot and a trafficking/ abduction scare on campus and in Eugene you can’t offer the dorm students some kind of covid year concession for better::: safer parking? Sooooo guess what? Since you have treated your out of state and other freshman in a disgusting manner::: every single person on her floor is LEAVING after this trimester or already left—- along with their $$$$!! Ya hear that Oregon board members! Ya hear that Oregon legislators! Leaving with our $$$$! I will contrast this with our child at the University of Oklahoma who has most classes online but still can go to the beautiful library that has had its tables spread out and are sanitized throughout the day. Huge study rooms available for socially distanced small group study and large screen zoom meetings::: everyone masked and sanitized. Can still get some food at the student union and sit at a socially distanced table. And she nor any of them have contracted covid. If there is any kind of questionable or safety incident on OR around campus we::: the paying parents::: are regularly notified by campus police and/ or directly by the President .

(Thats Levescy in Oklahoma City) otherwise Oregon has been one of the greatest disappointments ever!,What about last year's Seniors?,Dylan had a virtual graduation in December. He ended up not participating since it was 7 months after graduating and the fact that he was so disappointed😒,I believe you can do it!! This is ridiculous::: we are so far out from June!! So many vaccinations happening before June. Need to re think and access in April not February! Easy to come up with additional safety measures!,Good to know. Think we’ll look elsewhere for our incoming Freshman,Understandable::: but such a disappointment. ..😥,UO is starting to appear tone-deaf and resistant to small steps forward. Other responsible universities have moved to hybrid classes::: in person discussion groups::: in person small language classes etc. they have opened up their outdoor programs and outdoor clubs responsible. Not UO. Hardly any movement except to keep reiterating everything online. It really makes no sense when there are things that can be responsibly done. Look at schools like Cornell::: same size and rural setting as UO. Many things in person. So frustrating.,I'm a PhD student and will be graduating after 6 years of hard work in June. If there is anything the last 6 years of my program has taught me it's that life very rarely goes according to what we had planned and it often is simply not fair. Am I disappointed I don't get to experience that hooding ceremony I've always imagined? Well yeah I'd be lying if I said I wasn't. But it is what it is and my graduate experience is far more than a commencement ceremony. I appreciate that the university has had to make countless hard decisions for the past year. There are no winners here.  Support your graduate by helping them have a special and memorable celebration with you. My family is already making plans and I appreciate their support. I look forward to whatever UO has planned for us in the future and will use it as a great excuse to make a trip back to visit a place I have loved living for the last 6 years. :)  To those who are upset about the olympic trials::: there is no guarantee that's even happening either. Tickets are not on sale for it (I checked their website). I wouldn't be a bit surprised if those who had tickets roll over from last year are issued refunds as we get closer and the trials are held without spectators (if they even happen).,So sorry for Joanna but safe first . It will still be very special,I have a son at Oregon and two kids at college in Texas. I’m paying rent at an apartment in Oregon while my son studies at home because the campus is virtually shut down. Our Texas kids have dorms and housing filled to capacity::: classes in person::: football games::: Greek events::: campus open and graduation in person. Covid issues have been handled well on campus and the administration is committed to working with the students and having them on campus. This is truly disappointing.,Hopefully they get reduced tuitions? Or will you really just retain their tuitions at the same rate and price as pre pandemic?  If you're going to go virtual everything::: reduce the cost for tuition. Especially if quality suffers and services and sessions become increasingly less valuable.  I feel terrible for the students having to endure this all without answers.,SDSU::: TCU::: and Boise are a few colleges holding in person commencement this spring. Why not Oregon?,Yet 25:::000 were allowed to attend the Super Bowl in a 67k capacity stadium? Come on UO::: let our kids walk at Autzen!,Sometimes life hands us lemons 🍋 but usually the outcome strengthens our spirits. When again we might gather Ms Maya your scholarly achievements will be properly rewarded in spades..most deserved. Your tenacity is so admirable.💞,This is so disappointing. I have 1 son going to school in Arizona and 1 a duck. My freshman duck lived on campus last semester. no organized live human to human interaction activities. Written up for eating a bag of chips in a non-eating area. This announcement clearly shows that Oregon will be the last to provide student life. This week my other son in Arizona got word that his campus which has allowed hybrid classes and has organized socially distant activities is having graduation and fully opening in the fall::: while the same week UO announces canceling in-person graduation. (Arizona is actually slightly worse in numbers than Oregon). My son has decided to not return to UO and go to a school that has student life. He’ll now never have the experience at UO he worked so hard for and hoped to have. Numbers going down::: people getting vaccinated with majority of high risk people being vaccinated by March::: meaning less death::: and an absolute decision to cancel months out. Doesn’t make logical sense. Think outside of the box. Allow the students to walk. In the very least::: hold off on that decision allowing hope in the possible.,Even at a high risk level we can have outdoor events such as wedding with 100 people. Even if commencement is out of the question what about the individual departments having COVID SAFE graduations? You are planning on fall football why not graduation?,Just get the kids in class. I dont want to hear another thing until the students step foot in a classroom. If elementary::: middle and high schools can do it::: you can too. The so-called “hybrid” approach is a sham.

What a game. What a moment. #GoDucks #ProDucks  Los Angeles Chargers December 17::: 2020 at 10:22 PM ·  #ProDucks 💚,2020-12-18 20:26:21,A moment in time that is one of a kind! Awesome night to be a Duck!,It was an awesome game::: too!,That was a great game.,So amazing to see these 2 play last night! 💚💛🏈🦆,Such great men! So glad Mariota got a chance to show the Raiders what he can do!,I savored every moment. that doesn't happen very often. Than the day after Oregon wins the pac 12.,I didn't realize Herbert was taller than Mariota.,Two class guys!,What a great game:::::::::::::::::::::::: Such a close game ::: overtime::: and both played well.,So proud of how these two walk in the world,I agree. An incredible moment in a year filled with unspeakable horrors.,Merry early Christmas to us Duck Fans! This was the game I have been hoping to see when Marcus came to the Raiders and Justin to the Chargers! What a great game and gift! 💚💛 Go Pro Ducks!!!,"I joked a couple three weeks ago to my hubby. I said::: ""wouldn't it be weird if D. Carr got injured and MM8 had to come in and play against Justin H?""::: we were discussing the still to come games::: and the fact that 2 NFL QB's are Ducks. I could not believe it when right before my eyes Carr injures a groin muscle and WOW here comes Marcus. It was FANTASTIC watching Herbert and Mariota play against each other. Both great people and role models.",Dreams come true::: two legendary ducks shine in such an epic game.,Being a Ducks fan myself::: it was difficult to see one QB prevail over the other. Go Herbert! Go Mariota!,I felt like a kid on Christmas morning! Mariota VS Herbert! I honestly was rooting for both! Two amazing humble human beings and talented athletes that my son and I have both met. My son has both these guys autographs and they have given us so many father/son memories! Go Ducks!,Great game ...no matter which Duck you were rooting for! 💚💛🏈,A great game and such respect for each other. Proud to be a Oregon Duck fan 💚💛,I am big fan of Oregon ducks::: my son went that college .I am also true Raider fan (45 years) ..I truly didn't think Raider would win with all the defense starters out. I thought Herbert had this game and then Marcus was thrown in. Dang he showed what he could do (Carr cannot do what he does),Thank you both for the college years and now the NFL. Great game by both of you. Have a great holiday season,Two outstanding individuals and amazing athletes. Both are winners!,That’s so cool! Love this.. I was rooting for both teams! Loved this game!,I had to keep reminding myself::: they were not playing college ball :),I'm a Raider fan and a Duck fan. It was really fun to watch them::: head to head the whole way! Wonderful players:::. Herbert - ROOKIE OF THE YEAR! He gets my vote. Grateful to have Marcus on the Raiders.,2 talented and great DUCKS. Could not be more proud of these two!!,Fabulous game. I believe both quarterbacks were winners and then for the Ducks to winner over us. Awesome.,This was incredible. One of the best games ever.,The only time I was hoping for an NFL game to end in a tie. Go Ducks!,As an Oregon duck fan::: this was as good as it gets! Best game in along time! 🎉🎉🎉,I cheered each time either had a TD. Best NFL game for years. Last time two former Duck quarterbacks played against each other was 1960: Shaw vs van Brocklin,Both these qbs played exceptional::: especially Marcus with hardly any notice and not much practice. Herbert was fantastic. I rooted for both offenses.,As a huge Raider fan::: who lived in Hawaii for 10 years::: I was so conflicted yet excited during this game. I am just so happy to see these two making us Duck fans proud in the NFL.,Any fan of Oregon had to be in suspense throughout the 2nd half and overtime.... which Duck would prevail? Great game by great Ducks at the helm!! #WINTHEDAY,It was really awesome watching two Duck Men to go at it and it was such an exciting game. Sad the Raiders lost !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!,This is what sportsmanship is all about.

GO OREGON/BEAT SC!",Absolutely beautiful moment between two. Class acts!!! Their families and their Lord should be proud.,Both Oregon quarterbacks played great! I haven't been a fan of the Chargers since another Oregon quarterback - Dan Fouts!,Mariota was 3 yards away from an overtime victory::: 3 yards... He is my second favorite quarterback to Brady (being a New Englander). I know he has what it takes. He needs to make better decisions & not doubt himself. Also when he does make a mistake::: he needs to let it go! He played a good game. He had that game... come play for NE Mariota!,Two great quarter backs awesome game to see them play each other,Idk about Carr's injury and wish him the best...  But.. Hopefully Mariota gets the chance to start the rest of season... If Mitch Trubisky::: Cam Newton::: & Jalen Hurts can start.. so can he.,Watching this game with these two was epic loved it.,Mariota out played him but oh that Raider defense let him down....,Watching the greatest college player that has come through Oregon's program go toe to toe in the league with the guy who certainly looks like he has the ability to be the the best pro duck ever was truly one of my favorite sports moments of the last decade.,It was a great game!,This was awesome to watch. Huge Raider fan::: but was very conflicted. Go DUCKS!!!,Hearing them in the post game just kind of gush about the opportunity to play in the same game and just how much they admire and respect each other as players and Ducks was awesome! Such a fun game!,Two class acts. Marcus got the legendary college trophy but I think Justin is a better pro.,I’m not sure that the announcers ever put two and two together.,I honestly didn’t know who to cheer for::: and I certainly didn’t want the game to end. #GoDucks,Loved it too! Sorry Justin::: I was rooting for Marcus <3,THIS....'twas awesome!,This was the best to watch!!

It would also be helpful if the school could publicly comment on the attempts by the University's Student Governemnt to remove the College Republican group by cutting off funding and revoking its status. Attempts to silence other points of view don't simply run afoul of the Constitution::: but create a more basic problem. College campus should be a place where students are exposed to different ideas::: not protected from them; students can then accept or reject such ideas. Apparently::: this effort is not really related to a recent disagreement about a photo or comments about the election::: but a longer-term effort to silence consrvatove thought on campus.,More fear mongering !!!,It's great to see University of Oregon cares so deeply about stopping Covid-19!

It is not the SOLE answer ' wear a mask::: practice social distancing::: minimize crimes::: handwashing::: monitor your health....all these COMBINED is what works.

Lane county is now under the watch list by the governor. It's getting out of control and it's only going to get worse. Wear your f****** masks and stop being a child.

Thank you to those of you on this site that supported this post. To those of you that are making snide remarks::: look at the number of deaths today from COVID-19 and realize that by doing just one simple thing—wearing a mask—you would help bring that number down. You could “model” that behavior to others. Is that too much to ask? If you disagree with me::: just “bite your tongue.” If you can’t say something positive::: then don’t say anything.

We pause to remember those who lost their lives 19 years ago on this day. #NeverForget,2020-09-11 18:09:38,"Pretty sure that as a state school with governmental and DOE oversight::: the University of Oregon is subject to constitutional law. Censoring your students or community on social media is a 1st Amendment violation. You might want to check you Political Science Desk Reference...you r deletion if student's perspectives is against federal law. The University of Oregon has no grounds to refuse statements that are unflattering to your administrative or educational lobbying::: on 9/11 or any other day.  I spoke out because I am a political science student and a member of this community and I believe your message to be falsely proffered. I believe you do a substantial injustice to those who lost their lives on that day and to those who survived... on that day and every day since...to only care on the anniversary and not when students are telling you to care more about their struggles::: the costs you are forcing them to bear::: the institutional racism you enforce on the campus with racist murals and art work and statues that until the public took down::: your administration refused to care about. (Which you then called ""destruction of property"")  As a political science student::: I won't forget your censoring me on this day. And I will remind the administration::: and the persons running this page::: that if you leave it open to the public::: you cannot censor anything which the supreme court has determined is protected speech. As I did not say anything that is a violation of protected speech::: I remind the UO that it needs to reinstate my previous statement.  ""There is no exception for 'disrespectful speech'."" ~The ACLU when Fresno State threatened to fire a tenured professor in English over her twitter comments about the Bush family",🙏🇺🇸,Thank you UO. Not enough of this today. Let us never forget.,Lost but not forgotten.,❤️🙏🏼🇺🇸,#NeverForget,19 years ago::: a week before 09-11::: I came to Oregon as an exchange student in the Master of Accounting program. Having this terrible act of terrorism at the beginning of my year at the UO felt pretty strange and sad. But still the year turned out to be great and 19 years later::: I am still in love with Oregon. I feel this even more these days when I see the pictures of the devastating fires all around Eugene and in Oregon and California. Stay safe::: may God protect Oregon and all its inhabitants!

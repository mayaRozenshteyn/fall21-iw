I admire her so much! This season was a tough one due to Covid. She had a baby in September. Pushed through the season and made it to the Championship. It was also stated that she had to pump during half time so she could feed her baby girl! What a woman! Hats off coach! Hold your heads up ladies. It was the first of many!,Arizona Athletics in coordination with the University of Arizona::: and the Pima County Health Department have planned a 'Welcome Home::: Cats' event. Fans are invited to support and celebrate the team at approximately 11:15 a.m. with gates opening at 10 a.m. at the Arizona Stadium and streets along the bus route::: which will be announced after the championship game.,What Adia has done in such a short period of time is beyond phenomenal. In the women's game you can have one game changing talent that can springboard a program. Look at Rebecca Lobo at UConn or Sabrina Ionescu at Oregon as examples. Aari has laid that foundation for UA. Tucson is a basketball crazed town and had this not been a covid year::: I wouldn't have been surprised if UA averaged 10k fans for this season. Based off of the recruiting rankings for 22 I wouldn't be surprised to see UA land multiple top 20 recruits and spring board similar to how Oregon has into a national top 15 program. This program is just getting started. Very proud of this team. Bear Down!,Congratulations ! They are Champions in my book!,Proud to be a Wildcat.

March 21st is World Poetry Day! We want to take this opportunity to highlight our Poetry Center. The UArizona Poetry Center was founded in 1960 by Ruth Walgreen Stephan::: and Robert Frost read at the dedication on November 17th of that year. The original building was a small cottage adjacent to the university where Ruth often stayed during her time in Tucson. After donating the property::: she continued her benevolence to expand the Poetry Center with a dream of creating a welcoming space and vast library::: as well as a Poet’s Cottage for visiting writers. The Poetry Center building that stands today was built in 2007 to serve the university and Tucson area. If you look closely::: you’ll notice poetry designed right into the building itself!

The University of Arizona plans to celebrate graduates with a series of in-person ceremonies in May::: President Robert C. Robbins announced today.

Please reconsider allowing families to be there to support these students who have sacrificed so much over the last year. We have continued to pay the university the same tuition amount allowing families to attend is the least they can do.,Why is it that UA can allow Baseball and Softball to have fans in the stands now but WON'T allow parents in the stands for Graduation?? Makes NO sense. Especially if you spread the grad events over the course of a week? Let's see UA has a Football Stadium::: Basketball Stadium::: Soccer field::: Baseball field::: Softball field::: a shiny new indoor practice facility and the main campus Mall. Plus auditoriums and theater spaces. Please USE them for us! Us parents will come masked::: sanitized::: and some even will be vaccinated by then. Some vaccinated right on your very own campus!!!! We want to see our kids graduate in front of our very own eyes after supporting and paying you the last 4 years. I don't care if you give me a folding chair and have a stage in a parking lot::: I just want to see my Wildcat walk across that stage in front of me. Not on a TV::: Laptop or phone.,I am so happy for my daughter that she finally has something to look forward to in her Senior year. With that said::: we parents are an equally intricate part of our child’s education. If you are allowing people to go to the sporting events then you should allow families to sit in the stands for graduation and cheer on our children for all of their accomplishments .,So at first I was excited but now am depressed. A huge stadium with only 1000 students ( and we know some colleges have a lot less graduates) and no parents? This is ridiculous. Some of us have been vaccinated due to our professions and can’t attend? Even without vaccinating 2 adults per student couldn’t attend? I know my daughter won’t attend if we can’t attend. This is so incredibly sad::: especially for students whose programs last for 5 years.,My sons college has held graduation ceremonies.... they break them up into 3 days... and allow 4 tickets per family.,Very disappointed in the University of Arizona. We did in person graduation outside in the stadium in December in Texas. Very safe. It can be done!,Awesome news! I'm hoping my son can find a photographer to get some photos of him in cap and gown in the mean time. Nothing expensive. Just a few shots. Any recommendations ??,Don’t see why parents cant attend In socially distant pods - would be worth looking into.,Carol Eichorst that is insane that you cannot be there especially in a stadium that huge. Covid and its policies are out of hand and ruining peoples lives.,This makes me so happy and hopeful for my graduation in 2022! 👩🏽‍🎓✨,Great news!! The University of Arizona leading the way!🇺🇸,Grateful UA is making this a priority!,Should have done that for 2020 grads! What are you gonna do for them?

In 1866::: Buffalo Soldiers were established by Congress to help rebuild the country after the Civil War. They were made up of six all-Black cavalry and infantry regiments—the 9th & 10th Cavalry and the 38th-41st Infantry::: which eventually merged into the 24th and 25th Infantries. Many spent time in Vermont::: Kansas::: and Hawaii::: but Fort Huachuca can be called their true home because it's the only base that has housed all the units.  The term 'Buffalo Soldiers' came from the Native Americans::: though no one knows exactly why. Some believe it could have been because the soldiers fought fiercely like the valiant buffalo. Buffalo Soldiers served as the first rangers for the country's new national parks::: long before the creation of the National Park Service. The last all-Black units were disbanded in the '50s under President Harry Truman's Executive Order 9981::: eradicating racial segregation in America's armed forces.,2021-02-25 17:01:19,Here is something interesting. As the Civil War was ending::: a large group of southerners didn't want to live under the future laws of Lincolnites. I guess it was about a thousand southerners that went to live in Mexico. It was a long wagon train. They brought their luggage and their southern traditions and crossed the border in Texas. They were asked by the Mexican authorities to swear allegiance to General Juarez as Mexico was at war with France. The southerners turned over their long guns but they were allowed to keep their sidearms. Their leader was a former Confederate military man named Joseph O'Shelby who had a war related head injury.  History does not know much about them and what happened to them. Apparently::: some went to Mexico City to fight against Mexico along side Maxmillian::: the French leader who lost and was hung.  John Wayne made a movie based on the O'Shelby party. It was called The Undefeated. It was a horrible movie. They didn't understand history at all. Anyway::: I wish more was known about what happened. It just seems so interesting. Finally::: in my opinion::: the Franco-Mexican war was in many ways intertwined with the US Civil War. I think the conflicts could almost be considered the planets first World War.,A CVS branch in Tucson Administers the first COVID-19 Vaccine..horray right -\-\WRONG !!!COVID-19 vaccine doses tossed around state::: low amounts of CV19 Vaccines in Pima County ..Why is Maricopa More Important Than Tucson ???,The 24th

"Elgie Mike Batteau (no photo) – was the first Black student to graduate from the University of Arizona::: in 1933.  Elgie Mike Batteau was the first Black student to graduate from the University of Arizona in 1933 with a master’s in education. She grew up in Texas with her mother and aunt after her father passed away when she was 10 years old. Her mother instilled the value of education in Batteau::: despite not having the ability to pursue her own academic goals.  In 1934::: Batteau began her career teaching at the Dunbar School::: Tucson’s only school for African Americans. During an interview in 1988::: she shared::: ""Among all of the problems the Blacks had to incur the Black woman had to incur more. A woman teacher could not be married; nor could she live alone.

"The Kente Stole is a colorful handwoven sash that originated in Ghana with the Ashanti people. Today::: it is worn by people throughout the African Diaspora during rite of passage ceremonies::: such as graduation::: as a celebration of shared heritage and symbol of their accomplishment.  Some say the legend behind this cloth dates back to the mid-17th century with two brothers from the Bonwire village in Ghana. One day when the brothers::: Kurugu and Ameya::: found a spider::: they were amazed by its ability to spin webs and create beautiful patterns. The brothers were so inspired::: they decided to weave patterns just like the spider and created the first Kente Cloth using fibers from the raffia palm tree. Today::: the cloth is often woven from cotton and silk.    Kente comes from the word kenten::: which means ""basket"" in the Asante dialect referencing its basket-like pattern. The gold::: green::: red::: and black colors symbolize status::: growth and renewal::: sacrifice::: maturity and passing rites.  The Kente Stole is presented to our University of Arizona graduates at the Annual Black Baccalaureate Ceremony hosted by @AASAUofA to mark their journey.

Bear Down!,Las Vegas Bowl here we come!,Chill::: nay-sayers! This coach WILL turn UofA football around::: beat ASU::: and be on top of the Pac 12::: with time. ... NOT like Sumlin. ..... loser from the start ....,Hey UArizona what happened to we going to hire someone with Arizona ties::: all lies I guess,Justin Campana,He has 4 years to build a program. We will see what he is able to bring to the table and who he hires as his staff. Recruiting is always a problem so we will see how that goes.,We couldn’t have waited until Michigan fired Harbaugh so we could get RichRod 2.0?,It’s very difficult to go from coaching in the NFL where u don’t have to babysit the guys and they play like their job depends on it because it does::: to basically trying to teach young and immature men to treat football as a job. Most probably cannot comprehend this. But let’s just wait and see what this guy can accomplish.,👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻,It doesn’t matter who Arizona hires! They will get out recruited every year... can’t compete with the other schools for top recruits.. no body wants to play for UofA football,Wow. This is horrible.

I would hope that those responsible for making this decision::: read these comments. I would hope they feel how upset the majority of Wildcat fans are. Stinks! From what I can see here,I've never heard of the guy. What makes those doing the hiring think they have helped the program? Herm Edward's us kicking his chops. Easy wins for ASU.,You also pissed off the 300 alumni football players on your zoom meeting since you completely did the opposite of what they wanted. Why did you even bother?,Looks like the UA is going to lose alumni and donor support over this miserable hire. Was it worth it Robbins?  UA is the laughing stock of the football world over a career position coach who can't hold a job. https:// en.wikipedia.org /wiki/ Jedd_Fisch,Time for season ticket holders to revolt...,Uh::: the same UCLA team that went 6-7 when he was OC? Should have signed a Tucson Youth Football dad instead!,Stupid. Let’s start thinking about a new AD and HC.,Another bad hire smdh,I’m sure Nike had ZERO to say about this hiring...

Dr Robbins should be proud of U of A and it’s role in LEADING solutions to this pandemic. As an out state resident... I am proud and glad our son chose UofA over other in state options.  Most California schools (to include the UCs) have done little to nothing in the way of leading the innovation needed to overcome this virus. They have shut down to online learning yet continue to charge full tuition to their students::: without a full educational experience.  My son was able to do online mixed with in person labs for O Chem::: Physics and Biology and actually LEARN the material !!  I am more pleased EVERYDAY that our son attends UofA. The value and quality of education is second to none.

Meet Stephen Westby!  Pursuing his master’s in Higher Ed Administration Home states: Wisconsin and Kentucky Photographer: 2020 Operation Hat Trick merchandise photography with UArizona student veterans.  From human intelligence to emotional intelligence::: graduate student-veteran Stephen Westby shares how he continues to serve.  “I served in the Army as a Human Intelligence Collector. The job has a few different capacities::: and I spent most of my deployed time doing interrogations. I trained at Fort Huachuca::: just down the road. I immediately got sent with the Second Stryker Cavalry Regiment to Germany as part of President Bush’s surge::: when the fighting was at its most intense in various parts of Iraq.  After service::: I went back to Iraq for nine months as a civilian contractor::: then the UAE for 2 ½ years. I was contracting with the Air Force::: living in Dubai and loving my life. When I made the decision to go to school::: I remembered coming up to Tucson back when I was stationed at Fort Huachuca. I fell in love with the area::: the weirdness::: the art of it. For me::: UAZ was it.  My first job on campus was with Veterans Services. Eventually::: I was brought on to help the VETS Center start a peer network designed to assist veterans to transition into college. It’s the program we call PALS. My hope is that more and more schools realize it’s better to connect with their students than it is to just help them go on their own. Sometimes::: a lot of times::: veterans want to hear it from another veteran.  I went into the Higher Ed Administration program because I'd like to contribute to creating better outcomes for students. Over the last five years::: being able to interact with marginalized students and being able to reframe your view on the world and people and society::: it’s exciting and angering and happy all at once. I’d love to have a concentration on veterans but being able to make a positive experience for students is where I want to be.  I was in the Operation Hat Trick campaign getting my photo taken last year. And this year::: I was asked if I was interested in taking the photos. The Fisher House here::: it’s just so cool what they are doing. To give to service members and veterans who are going through treatment and their families need somewhere to sleep::: I can’t think of a better cause to give to.  Why I serve? That reason has changed a dozen times over the last fifteen years. Back then::: it was 9/11. And the kick in the butt from mom. I think it’s important for the public to give back to vets. I know very few veterans who expect anything. But::: why I do it::: is because not everybody comes home from war::: whether physically or mentally. We can do better for our veterans::: and OHT is a great example of that.”  When you purchase Arizona Operation Hat Trick merchandise::: you support our local Veterans.  Shop UArizona gear for Vets here: shop.arizona.edu/oht/,2020-12-10 17:00:48,I love this!!!!!!!!!,Take. The. Face. Diapers. Off. While. Taking. Pictures. Nobody. Cares. About. Your. Virtue.

Thank you for your service to our country and now students and vets!,Stephen Westby I am so proud of all you have accomplished and wish we lived closer so I could know you better. Nice to claim you as family. Hope that is ok with you I know how Maggie feels about you. Best wishes and loving thoughts for you.

Angelo was never really sure what he would do with the wish from @MakeAWishAZ that he was granted after his bone marrow transplant. After speaking to his volunteers and his parents::: he decided to use his wish for his future and asked for help with tuition to go to University of Arizona.  “I really didn’t know if I would survive my transplant so when it turned out to be ok::: I started thinking about what that meant that I could do now::: that my life would be better:::” said Angelo. “This wish is the start of that new life.”  Angelo looked to UArizona because he wished to be on a campus that was close to his family but would give him some independence. His time in the hospital also started him toward what he hopes is his future career.  “We had pet therapy at the hospital and every visit from the dogs really helped me feel better:::” said Angelo. “I want to make sure that there are always animals out there to make people happy.” Angelo will start with a few classes toward a degree in veterinary science.  “I want to be a vet and they have a vet school that looks to be a great school:::” said Angelo. “I’ve never been to a university and I can’t wait to get a start on my future.”  Help us welcome our new #wildcat! 🐻⬇️,2020-12-04 15:06:07,Welcome to the Wildcat family!

Meet Jenna Chacon!  Air Force Reserves Pursuing her Master’s in Nursing at the University of Arizona Home state: Texas  From having her heart set on culinary school to working on A-10 engines and pursuing a master’s in nursing::: Jenna has found her home. ⬇  “Why do I serve? I just really like it. I enjoy doing maintenance and working on engines. I think about doing a medical career::: but I know I would miss working on the line::: getting my hands all greasy and smelling like exhaust all the time. It’s more of a mentality working with people out there. It feels like home. When I started working on engines::: I was afraid it was going to fall on me. I never wanted to stand underneath it. There are three mounting areas where it attaches to the actual aircraft. I’d think::: ‘This could fall::: it weights 1:::400 lbs.’ But nope. That thing is in there!  I started here at the VETS Center in 2016. This place gives a lot of students::: who don’t necessarily feel they connect with the rest of the student body::: a place to feel more connected. Veterans::: they struggle::: just as much as anyone else::: but I feel it’s a different kind of struggle::: and not everyone relates to it. Eventually::: I want to work at the VA. That’s always been my top idea for nursing.  That’s what’s nice about Operation Hat Trick::: they are helping veterans. A lot of different veterans who have come back from foreign wars or conflicts didn’t necessarily get the treatment they needed. We have a high homeless veteran population::: which is incredibly sad::: because we didn’t understand mental health during those times. Now we understand it more! I think it’s better to take the time to understand them and their feelings::: rather than them going through their struggles alone in silence.”  When you purchase Arizona Operation Hat Trick merchandise::: you support our local Veterans.

Meet Ethan Chartrand of UArizona's NROTC.  Sophomore::: Computer Science Major Home state: Colorado  Read below as Ethan shares why he joined the military. ⬇  “When you first join the Marine Corps::: the recruiters give you these little tags::: and there’s seven of them. And the recruiter says::: ‘I want you to pick two of them.’ One tag is like ‘Job Opportunities.’ ‘One is Money.’ You know::: those are the things you’re interested in. And mine was ‘Exploration’ and seeing the world. So::: I really got to do that. I’ve traveled all over the world. More than I think a lot of people in my family have traveled::: that’s just not a thing my family has done. Getting to experience new things::: new cultures::: new places has been something that drew me in.  I have met some people in the military that have changed my life forever. You meet people who give their lives for this country. My wife is a nurse at the VA. She told me about the Arizona Fisher House. I think these programs are important. Seeing it from the other side::: all of my friends are either veterans or active duty. I’m at that point now::: almost 85% of the people I joined with are out. I see the struggles they go through.  One of my favorite things about being in the military is leadership::: and that’s why I wanted to be an officer through this program. There is a feeling you get when you take care of people in ways they can’t take care of themselves. I say::: the more people know about Operation Hat Trick::: the better.”  When you purchase Arizona Operation Hat Trick merchandise::: you support the Arizona Fisher House.

The traditional lands of the Apache Ndeh (The People) extended from Texas through New Mexico and Arizona into Mexico and California. Bands of Apache hunted::: fished::: farmed::: and traded throughout the region. Over time::: the many bands of Apache were forcibly relocated to reservations. In 1891 the Fort Apache Indian Reservation was established::: now known as the White Mountain Apache Reservation. Fort Apache originally included the San Carlos Apache Reservation::: but was separated by an act of Congress in 1897.  According to the Census::: approximately 13:::723 individuals live on White Mountain Apache Tribal land::: located in east-central Arizona. The Reservation covers 1.67 million acres::: with elevations ranging from 2:::600 feet in the Salt River Canyon to 11:::400 feet at the peak of Mount Baldy (a sacred peak to the White Mountain Apache Tribe). #NAHMonth  http://whitemountainapache.org,2020-11-23 15:30:08,I am Apache. My now deceased grandfather was from Whiteriver and a WW2 US Navy Veteran. His brother was a US Marine at Iwo Jima. I graduated from U of A with an MS in Computer Engineering in 2019.

Europeans first discovered Zuni territory in the 1500s. In 1680::: Pueblos (including Zuni) in New Mexico planned and revolted against Spanish domination. After attacking and burning a Spanish Mission::: the population of all Zuni villages sought refuge on the sacred mountain (Corn Mesa) until 1692. After the Spanish made peace with the Zuni::: the people settled in what is now present-day Zuni Pueblo. According the the 2011-2015 American Community Survey::: approximately 12:::869 individuals live in the Zuni Pueblo in New Mexico. The main Reservation is 450:::000 acres 150 miles west of Albuquerque. The tribe also has land in Catron County::: New Mexico::: and Apache County::: Arizona.  The Zuni have established programs to promote the unique spoken-only Zuni language into a written language form. According to the Census::: 86 percent of the Tribe speaks the Zuni language. #NAHMonth  http://www.ashiwi.org,2020-11-22 15:30:17,Thank you for this history. ❤️,Violations and persecutions of human rights in the Ministry of Awqaf and Religious Affairs and in cooperation with the General Personnel Bureau in Ramallah::: the West Bank ...

The Cocopah Indian Tribe::: known as the River People::: have lived along the lower Colorado River for centuries. The Cocopah Reservation was established in 1917::: and in 1964 the Tribe established a Tribal Council. The Cocopah Indian Tribe is one of seven descendant Tribes from the Yuman language-speaking people that lived along the Colorado River. Although the Cocopah people had no written language::: history and traditions have been passed down orally and through the diaries and journals of outside travelers along the Colorado River. According to the 2015 Census::: approximately 1:::273 individuals live on the Cocopah Tribe Reservation in Arizona.  The Cocopah Tribe is located in the southwest corner of Arizona near the California and Mexico borders. The land area consists of more than 6:::500 acres along the lower Colorado River::: with a land base of 9.4 square miles. The Cocopah Tribe is actively involved in habitat restoration efforts along the Colorado River. The reservation is comprised of three non-contiguous regions: the North::: East::: and West Reservations. The East and West Reservations are located 15 minutes from each other on either side of the town of Somerton. The North Reservation is located in Yuma. #NAHMonth  https://www.cocopah.com,2020-11-21 15:30:10
"Previously known as the Yuma Indians::: the Quechan Tribe of the Fort Yuma Reservation have always lived in the Colorado River Valley.

Their distinct language::: the native tongue of southeastern California and southwestern Arizona::: is believed to be spoken by just a few hundred people.  Their location along the Colorado River has meant a long history of trading and exchange networks with other tribes::: as well as battles over land. According to the 2015 Census::: 2:::393 Quechan live on the Fort Yuma Indian Reservation. #NAHMonth  https://www.quechantribe.com",2020-11-20 18:46:09,Allyson Collins
"“Bear Down"" is more than a casual piece of encouragement::: it's our rally cry. Telling all #wildcats to never give up::: keep pushing::: and you can do it!  Our newest wildcats might be wondering::: ""if we're the wildcats why is our rally cry #beardown?"" With roots over a century old::: here's the story of Bear Down.  In 1926::: John Byrd “Button” Salmon was the new student body president at the UAZ. He was also a varsity quarterback::: a baseball catcher and generally acclaimed popular campus figure. In October::: Salmon and several friends were returning from a visit to Phoenix::: and an automobile crash north of Tucson near Florence left the young athlete critically injured. Salmon::: 22::: lost his battle and died the morning of October 18th.  The coach at the time::: J.F. “Pop” McKale::: visited Salmon in the hospital regularly before his death::: and later told the squad the young athlete’s last message to his teammates was::: “Tell them... tell the team to bear down.” When word spread::: the UArizona student body painted the slogan on the roof of the University gymnasium. An airplane view of that huge-lettered phrase caused Jack K. Lee to write the song::: “Bear Down::: Arizona” during his application for the UA band job.  “Button” Salmon died generations ago but his message still echoes across every UArizon athletic venue::: in every corner and through every building on campus::: and in the thoughts of tens of thousands of Wildcat supporters past::: present and future.

The Colorado River Indian Tribes include the Mohave::: Chemehuevl::: Hopi::: and Navajo. The federal government established the Colorado River Indian Tribes Reservation in 1865 originally for the Mohave and Chemehuevl people that had lived along the Colorado River for hundreds of years. The Mohave have farmed the Colorado River basin for more than 800 years::: while the Chemehuevl were a nomadic tribe that inhabited the east branch of the Colorado River and farmed on a smaller scale. People of the Hopi and Navajo were relocated to the Reservation in 1945. Although the four Tribes share the Reservation and function as one political unit::: each Tribe observes its own unique traditions::: religions::: and customs. According to the 2015 Census::: approximately 2:::394 individuals live on the Colorado River Indian Tribe Reservation in Arizona.  The Colorado River Indian Tribes Reservation is located in western Arizona and spans into California. The Reservation is nearly 300:::000 acres::: including 90 miles of river shoreline along the Colorado River. The river is primarily used for irrigated farming. The primary community on the Reservation is located in Parker::: Arizona. Located twelve miles south of Parker is Poston::: Arizona::: the site of one of the United States' largest Japanese internment camps::: now home to an historic monument and museum. #NAHMonth  https://www.crit-nsn.gov,2020-11-19 15:30:34
"Mojave Indians are known as ""The People by the River"" (Pipa Aha Macav). Once the largest concentration of people in the Southwest::: they developed well established trade networks and prosperous farms.

"The Tohono O'odham Nation::: ""People of the Desert:::"" have lived in the region for more than 10:::000 years. The federally-recognized sovereign nation was greatly affected by the legacy of the 1853 Gadsen Purchase::: which split their lands between the United States and Mexico. Twentieth-century federal policies of forced relocation moved numerous Tohono O'odham families outside of Arizona::: yet many continue to live in the Sonoran desert of their ancestral lands.  According to the U.S. Census::: 20:::449 individuals live on Tohono O'odham tribal land in Arizona. The Nation is comprised of four distinct segments. The largest of these (the Tohono O'odham Reservation) is located 63 miles west of Tucson::: Arizona::: and is more than 2.8 million acres. San Xavier::: the second largest land base::: is 71:::095 acres. Smaller areas are the San Lucy District (near Gila Bend::: AZ)::: and Florence Village (near Florence::: AZ).

The Pee Posh (Maricopa) Indians were small bands that lived along the Colorado River. Eventually these bands migrated East and became known collectively as Maricopa. Upon migrating East::: they became allies with the Akimel O'Odham (Pima) Indians::: uniting against the Yuman and Apache Tribes. Some Maricopa settled in the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community::: while others settled along the Gila River. In 1859 Congress established the Gila River Indian Community::: comprised of both Maricopa and Pima Tribes.  According to the 2015 Census::: approximately 10:::947 individuals live on the Gila River Indian Community Reservation in Arizona::: located 34 miles south of Sky Harbor International Airport in Phoenix. The reservation is roughly 640 square miles::: or 372:::000 acres. This includes 15:::000 acres dedicated to agriculture: cotton::: wheat::: millet::: alfalfa::: barley::: melons::: pistachios::: olives::: citrus::: and vegetables. Independent farming operations include an additional 22:::000 acres of similar crops. #NAHMonth  http://www.gilariver.org,2020-11-15 15:30:08,At a Dept. of Agriculture on that reservation is where Pima cotton was developed.

"The Ak-Chin Indian Community consists of both Tohono O'odham and Pima Indians in the Sonoran Desert of south-central Arizona. The O'odham translation of Ak-Chin means ""mouth of the wash"" or ""place where the wash loses itself in the sand or ground."" According to the Ak-Chin::: this term refers to a type of farming that relies on washes or seasonal floodplains for irrigation. The Ak-Chin Indian Community was established in May 1912 through an Executive Order from President Taft. The originally-established 47:::600-acre reservation was reduced to less than 22:::000 acres in 1913. In 1961 the Tribe's government was formally organized::: and the Ak-Chin are currenty governed by a five-member Tribal Council.  According to the 2015 Census::: approximately 1:::065 individuals live on Ak-Chin Indian Community tribal land in Arizona. This land is located in the Santa Cruz Valley 58 miles south of Phoenix::: Arizona. All of the land within the Ak-Chin Community is held in trust by the United States government. The land area consists of 32.78 square miles::: with 16:::000 of the 21:::840 acres dedicated to agriculture/farming.

"Two tribes make up the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community: the Pima (""Akimel Au-Authm"" or River People); and the Maricopa (""Xalychidom Pipaash"" or People Who Live Toward the Water). The two tribes originally banded together for protection against the Yuman and Apache Tribes.  The Pima are descendants of the Hohokam::: an ancient civilization that farmed the Salt River Valley using elaborate canal irrigation techniques that are still used today. The Pima are known for their intricate::: watertight basket-weaving.  The Maricopa people were small bands that migrated east from the Colorado River. The Maricopa are known for their red clay pottery. When the Salt River Indian Community formed a Reservation in 1879::: it included both tribes within its boundaries. #NAHMonth  https://www.srpmic-nsn.gov",2020-11-13 15:30:05,Paolo,I love the history! 😊❤

The Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation was created by Executive Order in 1903. The Reservation is located in the territory of the once nomadic Yavapai people. Two important victories have shaped the history of the Nation: The Orme Dam Project and the fight for gaming rights. In the 1970s::: the community came together with other tribes to successfully fight the construction of the Orme Dam::: a project that would have flooded the Reservation and forced members from their homeland. And in 1992::: tribal members held a three-week standoff with the government::: a protest that persuaded the Arizona Governor to sign a gaming compact with the Tribe. May 12th is now a tribal holiday honoring that victory.  The Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation is located 23 miles northeast of Phoenix::: Arizona. According to the 2015 Census::: approximately 453 individuals live on the Reservation which is bordered by the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community on the south::: the Town of Fountain Hills on the west::: and the Tonto National Forest on the north and east. The Reservation is one of the smallest in Arizona::: covering just 40 square miles. The Verde River flows north-south through the middle of the Reservation and converges with the Salt River. #NAHMonth  https://www.fmyn.org,2020-11-12 15:30:13,The tribal council not interested in purchasing their ancestors land back which was once their agricultural lands.

The traditional lands of the Apache Ndeh (The People) extended from Texas through New Mexico and Arizona into Mexico and California. Over time::: the many bands of the Apache were forcibly relocated to reservations. The Rio Verde Reserve was established in 1871 for the Tonto and Yavapai Indians. In 1875::: the Tonto and Yavapai were forcibly moved to the San Carlos Apache Reservation. Twenty years later::: some of the Tonto Tribe returned to the Payson area. The Tonto Apache Tribe was federally recognized by Congressional Act in 1972.  According to the 2010 Census::: approximately 120 individuals live on Tonto Apache Tribal land in northwestern Gila County::: approximately 95 miles northeast of Phoenix. The Reservation is 85 acres adjacent to Payson::: Arizona::: and is the smallest land base Reservation in the state. #NAHMonth  https://itcaonline.com/member-tribes/tonto-apache-tribe/,2020-11-11 15:30:25,I worked at the casino on the reservation in Payson::: loved it!

The Yavapai-Apache Nation is made up of two distinct people: the Yavapai::: who refer to themselves as Wipuhk'a'bah and speak the Yuman language; and the Apache::: who refer to themselves as Dil'zhe'e and speak the Athabaskan language.  The Yavapai were semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers::: while bands of Apache hunted::: fished::: farmed::: and traded throughout the region. Over time::: Euro-American insurgency led to the forced relocation of the Yavapai and Apache to the Rio Verde Reserve::: and then to San Carlos. The Nation was formed in 1934 in an effort by the federal government to establish a single tribe in the Upper Verde Valley. #NAHMonth  https://yavapai-apache.org,2020-11-10 15:30:24

The Yavapai have lived in central and western Arizona for centuries. Today there are three primary groups of Yavapai: The Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation::: the Yavapai-Apache Nation::: and the Yavapai-Prescott Indian Tribe.  The Yavapai-Prescott Indian Reservation was established in 1935 on 75 acres of the former Fort Whipple Military Reserve. The Reservation was expanded to just under 1400 acres in 1956. According to the U.S. Census::: approximately 888 individuals live on Yavapai-Prescott Tribal land adjacent to Prescott::: Arizona. The Reservation is 1:::400 acres of rolling hills::: of which several hundred acres have been closed to development in order to preserve the natural beauty of the area. #NAHMonth  https://www.ypit.com,2020-11-09 15:30:17,I have been following the school from all scratch::: taking part in virtual events all the way from Ghana.i applied this but it seems I only had message of me gaining admission but without scholarship I can't pursue my education .the email I use to apply is acquahfrancis02 34@gmail.com
The San Juan Southern Paiute Tribe gained federal recognition in 1990::: but the Tribe has lived for several hundred years in territory between the San Juan and Colorado Rivers::: east of the Grand Canyon. The Tribe is one of the smallest tribes in Arizona::: and its traditional territory has been subsumed as part of the Navajo Nation reservation. In 1907::: Paiute lands north of Arizona in Utah were proclaimed as the Paiute Strip Reservation::: under the jurisdiction of the Western Navajo Agency. In 1922::: the Paiute Strip Reservation was completely integrated into Navajo lands and the Tribe lost their land base. Currently::: the San Juan Southern Paiute people live in multiple communities in Northern Arizona. The largest of these are in Willow Springs::: near Tuba City::: and near the Arizona-Utah border at Paiute Canyon. The San Juan Southern Paiutes have a language and culture distinct from the Navajo. #NAHMonth  https://www.sanjuanpaiute-nsn.gov  SANJUANPAIUTE-NSN.GOV Home | San Juan Southern Paiute Tribe,2020-11-08 15:30:15
"The Hopi are known as one of the oldest living cultures in documented history::: having migrated north to Arizona in the 12th century. The Hopi are guardians of the sacred land they call Hopitutskwa. The Hopi Reservation::: located on high and dry land::: forced the Hopi to develop a unique agricultural practice known as ""dry farming:::"" a system of relying on water-retentive tillage methods rather than irrigation.  The Hopi and Navajo Tribes have a long history of conflict over land. After years of escalating conflict::: the Navajo-Hopi Settlement Act of 1974 split land across tribes and forced relocation for those on the wrong side of the partition line. According to the 2011-2015 American Community Survey::: approximately 15:::031 Hopi Tribal members in Arizona. The Hopi Tribe Reservation is located in northeastern Arizona in Coconino and Navajo Counties. The Reservation is made up of 12 villages on three mesas (known as First::: Second::: and Third Mesa) on more than 1.5 million acres. Each of the older villages is made up of a hierarchy of clans based on the order of their arrival to the area. Modern villages and clan leaders trace their authority and rights in land to these original sources. The Bear clan tends to be regarded as the first and highest-ranking clan in a number of the villages::: with the male head of the clan serving as the village leader or ""Kikmongwi."" #NAHMonth  https://www.hopi-nsn.gov",2020-11-07 15:29:06,Erin Marie Noel Williams😘,Holly Figueroa 💜,One if the most amazing places I’ve been. My mother was born nearby as her Aunts were nurses there so her Mother travelled to Keams for my mom’s birth. As a adult my college/ coworker at the UofAZ was granted permission to fly over the mesas. We were up there to interview candidates for a university job. Flying over the sacred mesas is not a common thing to do. Afterward we toured one of the Mesas::: had food. Mutton stew. Hopi bread. Wish I had a camera with me back then to film the day. Amazing.,I am not really thrilled that Hopi have to be explained in their positionality to land conflict with Navajo Nation. Also::: while some clans migrated in the 12th century::: Oraibi has been carbon dated as being continually occupied for 10:::000 years. A higher education institution should do better.
"The Navajo or Dine' (meaning ""The People"" in the Navajo language) govern the largest reservation in the United States::: covering more than 27:::000 square miles and extending from Arizona into Utah and New Mexico. According to the 2015 American Community Survey::: more than 300:::000 Navajo reside in Arizona::: New Mexico::: and Utah.  The Navajo Nation is made up of diverse households. Households are more likely to be multigenerational (9.6 percent) than the state of Arizona as a whole (1.2 percent).* Less than half of households are traditional married-couple families (34 percent)::: and households headed by a single female make up one-quarter of all households. Most notably::: 53.5 percent of the Nation's householders speak a language other than English. #NAHMonth  https://www.navajo-nsn.gov",2020-11-06 15:30:21

"The Havasupai Tribe ""people of the blue green water"" have lived in the Grand Canyon and north-central Arizona for more than 1:::000 years. The Havasupai Reservation was established in 1880. Prior to the 1800s::: the Tribe would move families up to plateaus in the fall and winter months::: then back down into the canyon to plant drops during the spring and summer. The Havasupai dialect is the only Native American language that is spoken by more than 95 percent of its indigenous population.  According to the 2010 Census::: approximately 465 individuals live on Havasupai Tribal Land in Arizona. The Reservation is located at the end of Indian Route 18 off historic Route 66.

"The Hualapai Tribe::: ""People of the Tall Pines:::"" are a federally recognized Tribe in northwestern Arizona. In 1874::: the United States military forcibly relocated hundreds of Hualapai to the Colorado River Indian Reservation in Parker::: Arizona (called La Paz). Many died in the two week march or later due to disease and starvation during their yearlong internment. In 1875::: survivors escaped imprisonment and returned to their lands in northwestern Arizona. Each year::: the Tribe holds the Hualapai La Paz Trail of Tears Run to commemorate those survivors and their perserverance. The Hualapai Reservation was established by executive order in 1883.  According to the U.S. Census::: approximately 1:::567 individuals live on the Hualapai Reservation in Arizona::: approximately 108 miles along the Grand Canyon and Colorado River. Its elevations range from 1:::500 feet to more than 7:::300 feet. As a result::: the topography ranges from grassland to forests and canyons. #NAHMonth  Visit their website here: http://hualapai-nsn.gov",2020-11-04 09:30:00,Thank you for sharing Arizona tribe’s history. 💙#NativeAmericanH eritageMonth,🙏🙏🙏,We need more history lessons.

The traditional lands of the Southern Paiute people spanned more than 600 miles along the Colorado River. In 1865::: federal Indian agents began to formally remove Southern Paiutes from their land onto reservations. The Kaibab Band of Paiute Indians was established in 1934 under the Indian Reorganization Act.  The Kaibab Band of Paiute Indians have been greatly affected by the construction of the Glen Canyon Dam in 1963. The dam originally flooded San Juan Paiute farms and affected plant and animal life and other culturally significant places. In 1993::: the Kaibab Band of Paiute Indians and the Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah created the Southern Paiute Consortium to address concerns over the operation of the Glen Canyon Dam. #NAHMonth  Visit their website here: http://www.kaibabpaiute-nsn.gov  KAIBABPAIUTE-NSN.GOV Kaibab Paiute Tribe,2020-11-03 09:30:00,Joshué Manriquez

Captured on Oct. 20::: 2020 during the @NASA's OSIRIS-REx Asteroid Sample Return Mission’s sample collection event::: this series of images shows the SamCam imager’s field of view as the NASA - National Aeronautics and Space Administration's spacecraft approaches and touches down on asteroid Bennu’s surface::: over 200 million miles away from Earth.  The sampling event brought the spacecraft all the way down to sample site Nightingale::: touching down within three feet (one meter) of the targeted location. The team on Earth received confirmation at 6:08 pm EDT that a successful touchdown occurred. Preliminary data show the one-foot-wide (0.3-meter-wide) sampling head touched Bennu’s surface for approximately 6 seconds::: after which the spacecraft performed a back-away burn. The spacecraft’s sampling arm – called the Touch-And-Go Sample Acquisition Mechanism (TAGSAM) – is visible in the lower part of the frame. The round head at the end of TAGSAM is the only part of OSIRIS-REx that contacted the surface during the sample collection event. In the middle of the image sequence::: the sampling head positions itself to contact the asteroid’s surface head-on. Shortly after::: the sampling head impacts site Nightingale and penetrates Bennu’s regolith. Upon initial contact::: the TAGSAM head appears to crush some of the porous rocks underneath it. One second later::: the spacecraft fires a nitrogen gas bottle::: which mobilizes a substantial amount of the sample site’s material. Preliminary data show the spacecraft spent approximately 5 seconds collecting surface material::: and the majority of sample collection occurred within the first 3 seconds. The TAGSAM is designed to catch the agitated surface material::: and the mission team will measure the amount of material collected through various spacecraft activities. After touchdown::: the spacecraft fired its thrusters to back away from Bennu. This maneuver also disturbed the Nightingale site::: and loose debris is visible near the end of the image sequence. The team expected this disturbance to Bennu’s surface::: and preliminary telemetry shows the spacecraft remains in good health. The spacecraft was traveling at 0.2 mph when it contacted sample site Nightingale and then backed away at 0.9 mph. These images were captured over approximately a five-minute period. The imaging sequence begins at about 82 feet (25 meters) above the surface::: and runs through the back-away maneuver::: with the last image in the sequence taken at approximately 43 feet in altitude –about 35 seconds after backing away. The sequence was created using 82 SamCam images::: with 1.25 seconds between frames. For context::: the images are oriented with Bennu’s west at the top.,2020-10-21 15:19:00,That’s a trampoline right ?

It's International Pronouns Day today! It is officially the third year that we get to come together to learn about and educate people on the use of personal pronouns. A pronoun is more than just a word. They hold a lot of significance in how we see others and ourselves::: and they are directly tied with who we are. Recognizing and using someone's preferred pronouns can be empowering and reassuring for them. It's just one way to show people that their identity is valid and that they are accepted. Learn more about International Pronoun Day by visiting https://bddy.me/3mbGBuG,2020-10-21 11:00:00,"Why does somebody need me to ""validate their identity""? Be you and be proud! Don't seek validation from others::: That sounds rather insecure to me.",Chris Nardolillo,This seems like much ado about nothing... I meet someone::: unless completely obvious... most people will assume traditional gender pronouns... if I mis speak::: it’s an easy “I’m sorry::: how would you like me to address you?”.... then honor it.  No need to be bent out of shape by either party... but also best not assume just because someone mis speaks its an intentional slight.  I have a doctorate degree.... I hardly ever use the title... but if in professional role and someone introduced me as Mr::: but I’d like to be addressed as Dr.... I just say “please address me as x:::y:::z....”. And move on with the conversation.  If one is so uncomfortable in their chosen pronouns that they feel offended when not used correctly...

With October 20th right around the corner::: here's a look back at the record breaking journey the University of Arizona-led OSIRIS-REx mission has had thus far... here's to a successful TAG event in T-5 days! Let's set some more records @OSIRISREx 🛰 Catch up on the mission at osirisrex.arizona.edu,2020-10-15 09:31:00,Going to be just like the movie “life”.,Wonder if they seen....E.T.
In an ongoing commitment to limit the spread of COVID-19 in the Tucson community and across the nation the 2021 Spring Break will be replaced with a series of Reading Days spread throughout the Spring 2021 semester. See @UAZProvost announcement here: https://bit.ly/2SSLxaT,2020-10-14 15:49:00,If next semester wasn't my last::: I would take it off... This change will benefit no one.,This is not limited to U Arizona. My daughter is at Miami University and they announced the same thing several weeks ago.  To me this isn’t nearly as foolish as having the student body on campus but still doing classes via zoom.,Peter Tsipis oh wow,“Reading Days.” What a joke of a college experience the students are being given. And at such a steep price. I’m sure there will not be any partying going on during those days right?,What does this accomplish? Asking honestly because I don’t understand. From the surface::: I would not have liked this in my UA days...,That sounds fun Heather Miller...,Reading days just keep the students locked up in their rooms alone without truly providing them a time to improve their mental health. Would have been better to start the semester a week later or end the semester early like other college campuses are doing.,Sorry::: what are Reading Days and what are the expectations for the students?,This is not good ::: they need a break ! It’s hard enough with zoom for everyone !!!,This is probably the dumbest thing I've ever seen. Great job!  PS - stop calling me for donations.,Ummm...so with 2 back to back days off in March::: you don’t think Spring Break won’t still happen?😂😂😂,wtf! covid:::::: keeps on giving! cancellations continue!! wonderful!,If this is going on next year we’ll be taking a pass on UofA etc. I would like my freshman to be able to come home on her breaks. Or like others have said - just skip the breaks.,Sounds like a law suite to me,This school is starting to be a joke.,As a fully online student::: this decision seems a bit unfair.,I hate this school. Worst 4 years of my life.,Im so sad to see U of A buying this bologna,Brian Valencia,I like the idea of a few breathers!,I saw so many photos of family weekend and NO MASKS. Why?,The only good thing about this is that I’m no longer a college student. The UA can take their propaganda and shove it up their ***!,Did anyone actually ask the students how they feel about this? It feels like a disconnected plan with little concern for student mental health. The entire covid response by University Leadership has been and continues to be disappointing.,This is not my interpretation of Bear Down! Why do you keep pushing this fear on students to keep them locked up? I see multiple fear posts::: testing waste water::: etc. There’s no more justification for this fear agenda against our youth.,This is about as helpful as my daughter being told to take her class in her car because she can’t get home from a required in-person class on campus before her next class starts ! Wise up UA.,This is what happens when your college doesn't have a social work department.,I think ending semester a week earlier would've been a better option.,Jane Hyde Farley FYI,Ridiculous.,Thank God I go to ASU and not UA 😅,I used spring break as a literal break. You know::: to rest and relax. I also used it to catch up on homework and to even get ahead in my classes. I can’t do that with reading days,I think that's better news than this past Spring Break. I had my peers tell me they were traveling out of town for Spring Break because they weren't going to let a virus stop them. So... I consider this a win. #BearDownMaskUp,Kept my daughter home this year. Had a decision to delay her university for a year because she absolutely hates online. But she made the choice . She understands the severity of Covid and she gets to stay home with us old fogies for a year. I’m glad she is home.,People need to wake up and see that as long as the university’s are run by liberal minds::: things will never be “pro student” it’s all about making money::: paying the liberal professors::: student going into debt::: etc! This year should prove that university is a waste of money and people need to find a different solution to getting a degree.,Stupid,But yet they are now going back after thanksgiving break. Makes no sense.,So::: it’s okay to restart sports and have 100 students compete with other students in sports and not wear masks. This is about money::: not keeping our WCs safe. I don’t see how restarting sports is okay::: but small gatherings on or off campus are prohibited. Then they cancel their spring break.,The new abnormal.,This is so stupid. All of UA’s covid policies are full of hypocrisy,The university just pretends to care about their students!!! They don’t care about their students health! They don’t care about anything!  The UofA is too political! Giving power-hungry White and Black Moms the authority to bully::: target::: intimidate::: and badger others who are not in their little club!!  Yes::: I was the victim of a hate crime!!!!! And the university condones this kind of behavior!!! So it stands to reason that they would not care about your students’ health!!!  The university cares for nothing but their pocketbooks so they won’t shut down the university and switch to online learning only!!!  Thank goodness I had the foresight to make my son stay home!!  I have saved thousands of dollars by not staying in a dorm or renting an apartment snd the hassle it would have cost me to move him home after spring break and lost money on an apt.!!!  I’m sure the landlords will not give any money back nor will they let people off on their leases!  The dorms might give a little money but not much!  HaHa! Jokes’ on you all who let your kids go back to campus!!! And who bullied me every time on this pandemic issue!!!  For those of you who still continue to balk at wearing a mask - you are all fools!!!! Have a happy life living with COVID-19 forever!!!! And suffering through it or dying from it!!!  Oh!! And by the way - the “reading days” - what kind of stupid resolution is this for the virus?!! Whoever came up with this stupid resolution should be fired!!! What an idiotic move!!!!

""Being an international student starting at a foreign institution in my midlife age has given me the opportunity to learn to love the U.S. in my own way. My family adapted our senses and values to fit a multicultural city like Tucson and has come to understand that there is not one true way to describe our Hispanic or even Mexican roots.  My research and teaching both expand on knowledge about health and the built environment::: cultural implications in sustainability::: and online education::: and has linked multiple organizations with UArizona such as the US Green Building Council::: the Consulate of Mexico in Tucson::: the Tucson 2030 District::: Local First Arizona::: and the International Traditional Knowledge Institute.  In my position as HSI fellow I will continue to contribute to the understanding of the ways that Hispanics bring socio cultural::: economic and environmental gains to our university so new students feel at home. More importantly::: that students come determined to learn and confident that resources for success are in place. For this::: I want to acknowledge the inspiring and brave leadership of Dr. Marla Franco and the HSI Fellow program.

"A historic moment is on the horizon for the University of Arizona-led NASA OSIRIS-REx mission. On October 20th::: the @OSIRISREx mission will perform the first attempt of its Touch-And-Go::: or TAG::: sample collection event. During the #TAG2020 event::: the spacecraft will descend to asteroid Bennu's boulder-strewn surface::: touch down for a few seconds and collect a sample of the asteroid's rocks and dust. It will be the first time NASA has grabbed pieces of an asteroid::: which will be returned to Earth for study.  OSIRIS-REx is charged with collecting at least 2 ounces of #Bennu's rocky material to deliver back to Earth – the largest sample return from space since the Apollo.  ""The spacecraft will be talking to us at 40 bits per second::: so we're not getting a lot of information about how much sample we collected:::"" Lauretta said. ""Over the next week or so::: we will do series of activities to understand how the TAG event worked and do as much as we can to verify that we collect our minimum of 60 grams – 2 ounces – of sample or more.""  Read on to learn how the University of Arizona mission’s team will ensure the spacecraft collects an abundance of Bennu's surface material https://news.arizona.edu/story/osiris-rex-begins-its-countdown-tag 🛰",2020-10-08 10:01:00,Cindy Stead Valus,Can’t wait!,https:// eas.arizona.edu/,When are you starting spring semester,Brian,Incredible!

Nothing about Covid Watch Arizona is mandatory. Instead::: users can choose to enter their random::: non-identifiable verification code into Covid Watch Arizona and anonymously alert others. However::: the more users download and enable the app::: and the more who choose to anonymously notify others::: the better we can help stop COVID-19 transmission on our campus.,2020-10-04 12:30:00,Please wake up folks! Donald Trump assured 300:::000:::000 Americans in February that we had nothing to worry about with Covid-19!  He of course was proven to be lying to everyone of us as documented on tape (no you can’t deny it; no it’s not fake news from CNN::: just bold-faced lies by Trump::: people!)  Here we are still at #1 in deaths in the world by far::: and over 200:::000 dead Americans::: a screwed up economy due to lack of proper national response::: who were assured: nothing to worry about::: it will go away soon::: and a vaccine will be ready in a few weeks. That my fellow Americans were the words of the President.  He is OUR employee::: not the other way around and if you think an employee who makes that deadly of a screw up deserves to be given a great evaluation by re-electing him::: you must have some severe self-esteem issues to refuse to speak out about anything he does!,How is the U identifying and tracking potential superspreader places and members of the UA Community? That info appears to be quite useful based on more than nine months of global data. Bear Down!,That would be a NO.
You will not get in trouble. Covid Watch Arizona is more effective the more people download and install it and choose to anonymously notify others. Because there is no identifiable information::: your identity is never revealed. The only thing you or others see is the date and duration of possible exposure::: which is only based off of anonymous Bluetooth signals between phones that have the Covid Watch Arizona app installed.,2020-10-03 16:00:00,That would be a hard no to the app.
If you received your positive test result from Campus Health::: your verified code may have been provided to you verbally by your doctor or nurse when you received your positive test result. Your code may also have been included on your test paperwork. If you are unable to locate your code or you received a positive test result from someplace other than Campus Health::: please contact Campus Health for more information and next steps. https://bddy.me/3jtJxSq,2020-10-02 16:30:00

Why can’t my UofA college student do so as well?  This is having very negative sociopsychologi cal impacts on the students. There is practically a zero risk to the students who have no underlying health issues. Protect the staff and get the students back to class. PLEASE.,How about giving an update on any kind of return to the classroom plan for the immediate future or next semester? You spend a lot of time with fodder.

Sick people should wear a mask and protect others and isolate but nothing supports the continued shut downs and isolation::: nothing.,but you guys are having students that are in the covid dorms leaving and kids that don’t even have covid entering,Great job! We must wear a mask to help stop the spreading of this virus. Back in the 20’s during the Spanish flu::: everyone wore a mask::: they never got a vaccine and wearing a mask helped them fight the virus.,No one I know has been surveyed and they all said they wouldn’t want to wear a mask in class,Bear Down::: Arizona! Keep putting out these public service announcements. Use Wilbur and Wilma as well 😀,Ah fanning the coals of fear in our youth::: well done. How about a comparison between COVID and other pathogens you know like all the ones with a higher mortality rate? Fear::: fear::: fear::: it's how the masses are controlled.,If I was a student there now I surely wouldn’t want to wear a mask.,So why not let the 20 % who don't want to wear a mask::: not wear a mask. You didn't give any sources of your polling.,The University of Arizona what are you doing to prepare for in person class? The weather will be cooler soon::: have you planned for outside in-person classes? My freshman has not been able to meet people. There have been no freshman welcome::: no dorm floor meet and greets::: nothing. Her roommate left weeks ago due to misery. I had hoped you would come up with some sort of adaptions and some plan to have kids meet each other. Covid is not an excuse. College is new to freshman::: many coming from other states. Utterly disappointed. Covid seems to be the only thing you care about. If that is all there is::: why did you take money for tuition::: boarding::: and meal plans? The kids got Covid tested over and over and over yet no classes. Masks mandatory everywhere. If they worked why aren’t you having classes? So disappointed.,Well done UArizona!!,Delivering for door dash::: I spent a big portion of the night Friday night on university.

Last Friday::: Dr. Deborah Birx::: the coordinator of the White House's coronavirus task force::: toured the University of Arizona labs where researchers are helping in the fight against COVID-19.  Birx praised UArizona's efforts to find asymptomatic cases by testing as many members of the university community as possible. UArizona has administered nearly 33:::000 tests since early August. Each day's test results are published at 8 p.m. on its COVID-19 dashboard.  Read more from her visit at https://bit.ly/3i7jAXh,2020-09-26 10:01:00,Since August ehh?,Good for Az. But did anyone ask her where she lost her moral compass?,Emily Jarvis,She's a joke. But okie dokie.,Should have gotten Fauci. Birx is just a Trump stooge who has lost all medical credibility.,Has anyone else noticed that many of the places hit hard early on::: now have the best numbers? Is it because they have had to take such drastic measures to mitigate the virus::: is it just the masks::: or is a a partial herd immunity? I am not at all medically or educated enough in science to be an expert::: but I feel that there is certainly some data to support each::: including the herd immunity portion. Switzerland is basically safe now. The hardest hit U.S. cities are showing low numbers now. Maybe::: in hindsight::: we should have concentrated on better isolating the immune compromised::: and let the rest of the country live OLD NORMAL.,Katie Blomquist,... yes::: extensive testing and fast::: transparent reports of cases seems like a swell idea.  Maybe she could like::: ya know::: bring that back up the ladder.,Proud of my alma mater,My son showed up for testing at 3:30::: results by 4:30 Antigen test👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 U of A Bear Down,I don’t trust the data!!!,Did you know everyone tested is automatically catorgorized as positive so they get money right away?

"NASA's OSIRIS-REx Asteroid Sample Return Mission #tag2020 event on October 20th is getting closer... We learned last week that TAG is tricky. So why did the University of Arizona-led @OSIRISREx mission choose to collect a sample from #bennu?  “We were interested in its chemistry. We really wanted something that was rich in water and rich in carbon because that’s the science questions that we’re asking here:::"" said Dante Lauretta::: OSIRIS-REx principal investigator at the University of Arizona. ""We are trying to understand why life formed on planet Earth::: and by understanding that::: how likely is life to be present elsewhere in our solar system.""  Bennu is a rare B-type asteroid that's primitive and carbon-rich. Studying samples of its surface material can help us piece together the story of our solar system… Bennu also has an orbit close to the Earth::: so the journey out there wasn't too rough. In fact::: every 6 years::: Bennu comes very close to earth::: which makes its orbit potentially hazardous. However::: there's only a 0.037% chance that it'll impact Earth and not until the late 22nd century.  So::: not only will studying Bennu teach us about how our solar system formed and the origins of life on Earth::: but the findings will help us be prepared in the event that Bennu's orbit is considered hazardous during the next century.  Tune in next week for more... #tobennuandback",2020-09-24 13:14:00
"Center for Creative Photography presents ""Cheriss May: Beyond The Protest""  Photographer and educator Cheriss May shares her experiences covering the intersectionality of race::: politics::: and protest::: in the wake of the national reckoning on racial injustice. May will then be joined by CCP Director::: Anne Breckenridge Barrett::: for conversation and virtual Q&A with the audience.  This free virtual event will stream live on the CCP's Youtube and Facebook pages. There is no registration required.  About Cheriss May:  Cheriss May is a lauded portrait and editorial photographer based in Washington::: D.C. She is the president of Women Photojournalists of Washington::: an Adobe Education Leader::: and an adjunct professor at Howard University::: her alma mater. She is often commissioned to speak about inclusive storytelling. Her work has appeared in O Magazine::: The White House Historical Association::: The New York Times::: Bloomberg::: Time::: ABC News::: The Today Show::: and MSNBC. Cheriss’s work is featured in a permanent exhibit: MFON's In Conversation: Visual Meditations on Black Masculinity at the African American Museum in Philadelphia.  ""Cheriss May: Beyond The Protest"" is part of the 2020 fall program series for the upcoming CCP exhibition ""Photojournalism 20/20: A Think Tank for an Unimaginable Present."" Looking through the lens of CCP’s historical collection::: Photojournalism 20/20 will consider the critical role of photojournalism during this period of physical confinement::: protests for racial justice::: and a presidential election season. The installation takes on a new timeliness by acting as an interactive::: in-progress think tank that gathers raw material in real time about photojournalism in our daily and collective lives over the course of 2020. It does so in the search for ways to address how photography is both shaping and documenting these global crises::: and to archive our experience of 2020 for future research about photojournalism.

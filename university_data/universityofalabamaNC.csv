Bravo to the Coaches and team effort.,Beat Dawgs,I hope to see more quick release passes::: more option sweeps::: run plays off the TE’s on offense and on defense extra pressure on the QB’s::: more knocked down pass attempts::: stuffing the middle::: don’t let the run plays get outside::: interceptions::: and knocking the 🏈 loose causing fumbles this upcoming game and make sure Corner Backs are turning around at the last moment to stop penalties and of course no penalties at all and time management of the clock.

It’s not about braggin’
Nor even to boast
It’s about giving their all
From coast to coast

Carrying the tacklers
For a five yard ride
They’ll not give up
Nor be denied

Our defensive backs
They go for the ball
And the line digs in
When we’re against the wall

They’re stepping up
And not giving ground
Never relenting
Till victory is found

It’s about giving the most
And being the best
Giving more effort
Than all the rest

Pouring their all
Into every play
Having real satisfaction
At the end of the day

Ultimate performance
Is our Crimson Pride
And nothing less
Is FIT TO BE TIDE!

Every man giving
Only his best
There isn’t any better
In East or West

With Hogs to hunt
And Rebels to rout
Roll Tide Roll
Is what we shout

With Wildcats to whip
And Hurricanes to hammer
Each game ends
With Rammer Jammer

With the Irish erased
And the Bulldogs beat
Our National Titles
Are oh so sweet

With Saban in charge
It’s not surprising
Our time has come

In case you missed it…ONYX is BACK! This time last week::: students were getting ready for a long-awaited night of fun! 💯ONYX is a long-standing UA tradition that brings students together during Weeks of Welcome - and special guest President Bell was also in attendance! #RollTide,2021-08-27 23:23:23,RTR ❤️,ROLL TIDE. Take care everyone.,I love our students!!,Student loan sadly is a necessary evil as most students without scholarship can't get university education without it. I had my student loan running high and no means to clear it until I saw a random facebook comment about Trevor Seth Reynolds. He’s a bitcoin trader and he has helped me with my financial problems. I started by investing $500 with him::: and with the profits I received from my first and subsequent investments::: I’ve cleared my student loan. Trevor’s the real deal! He can do the same for you::: hit him up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Students are moving back to Tuscaloosa and campus is getting busy - and #FirstDayUA is only a week away!! 😳 If you're part of our alumni family::: drop some tips below to help incoming students have a successful first day of class next week! 💯 #RollTide

Our pro-tip: Find a campus map with photos of buildings on the UA Safety app! 📱",2021-08-11 17:11:05,Do not get behind.,Read the syllabus 🙂🙃🙂🙃😎,"Yes::: the answer to most questions is ""IT IS IN THE SYLLABUS"". Also::: limit your partying to the weekends. Tuscaloosa and the university offer fun things to do every day of the week. You must be disciplined or you will fall behind. Especially true for a new student - you don't know yet what you can handle.",Have a great time !!,To put it simply- go to class!,Walk your schedule ahead of time and put everything in a planner.,DONT go out and get drunk right away::: especially before the first day. Give yourself time to settle in and get into a routine and get used to the place.,"Make friends with everyone around you in classes the first few weeks! You will not regret study buddies!

Even if you’re shy just do it!",Leave and go home.,Read your syllabus::: get a calendar::: and go to every class.,The UAPD are awesome! They are always there is help if you need them! My tip would be to save their direct number (205) 348-5454 as a contact in your phone!,Stay away from the booze. It will serve no good purpose for your life. Find a local small group such as Navigators::: Campus Crusade or Reformed Campus Fellowship.,Sit by Tanner Ryan in every class,Get vaccinated::: encourage everyone you know to get vaccinated::: wear your mask over your nose while indoors::: wash your hands regularly::: and take COVID seriously. If you are dead::: you can’t graduate.,Don't take this for granted! Alabama is there to make you successful::: don't let it slip away.,Love every minute because when your done....you WILL miss it later!,Always wear your high school shirts and your bama bound lanyard around campus,"Don’t try to schedule all of your classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays. 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. only two days a week doesn’t sound so bad until you’re 5 hours deep in that day. It makes for long days with very few breaks.

Also::: it’s ok if you don’t go home much the first semester because you will be really busy. The second semester will come around and you’ll be missing home so much that you will probably visit often.

Finally::: make friends in your classes::: preferably with the kid who asks a lot of questions or the smartest kid in class—you’ll learn a lot from them. Don’t be a bum though—pull your weight and don’t let your group members down on projects.",Don’t believe everything the instructors tell you. Think for yourself.,"Along with calling mom/dad also go home to visit as much as you can! 🥺 Get to class::: get good grades::: enjoy the journey because in no time..it’s time to leave and continue life!
DON’T DRINK & DRIVE!!",Joyride,Trust your intuition! Get up and Roll Tide!!!!,Meet your professors. They are there to help you. Go to office hours if needed.,Join an intramural team even if it’s in a sport you don’t play!! I made some lifelong friendships playing intramural sports at Alabama and that’s actually how I met my husband. We were placed on the same flag football team 18 years ago and have been married now for 15 years ❤️ Enjoy every moment and ROLL TIDE!!,If you think you’ll want to be a season ticket holder later on down the line::: go ahead and put your name on the Tide Pride list now to start accruing points! 🏈🐘,Do whatever you can to avoid taking out student loans or at least take out the minimum amount you can get by with. Trust me::: you don’t want to be stuck paying on those high interest loans the rest of your life! Ask me how I know that! 😒,"Invest in a calculator..the
slide rules are too slow!!🧑‍🎓🧑‍🎓🧑‍🎓🧑‍🎓",Go find your classes before the 1st day ::: know where you are going to park and how long the walk is to class::: get vaccinated! Roll tide,If it's offered::: do virtual classes. Campus is hotter than 9 hells during fall semestsr,Always carry an umbrella or rain jacket on you. You never know when it’s gonna start raining.,Gee::: I miss my Capstone days!,Go to class. Sounds simple::: but you’d be surprised how many people (myself included) don’t get that missing classes is going to hurt your GPA.,Carefully read each professors rules for missed classes::: dropping test grades::: extra credit etc. Professors make the rules for their classes::: not university wide rules.,"Don't buy all the crap you're about to be fed.
Research facts::: think for yourself. Common sense is a super power.",Wait to buy your textbooks to see how and/or if your class will use them! Especially in 100 level classes,Buy all the stuff for your dorm rooms and apartments in your hometown and bring them here because Walmart and Target will be tapped out the week before and 2 weeks after move-in. Also::: find all of your classrooms and map out your route on campus for the different days. This is especially true if you have to hike across campus or catch a bus between classes.,RTR ❤️,Buy all your Bama merchandise on the Strip at Bamastuff and Alabama Express. The Supe Store is NOT the only option and is sometimes significantly more expensive for same items. #ShopSmall,Get a calendar::: planner::: or even an app on your smartphone to keep track of assignments::: events::: important deadlines::: and other things. I personally kept a calendar next to my desk in my dorm to keep track of assignments and any events I wanted/needed to remember.,Enjoy every single minute! ❤️ It flies by!,"Enjoy each moment::: meet as many new people as possible::: try something new::: stay until the end of each & every football game. Be kind::: be safe take care of your friends::: work hard & appreciate your parents for this amazing opportunity. Call your mom she already misses you! Finally::: these will be the greatest 4 years::: they go fast. Alabama is a special place::: soak it all in & Roll Tide ❤️🐘🏈🙏🇺🇸
❤️🙏🇺🇸",Laraine Cooper Potter::: Jackie Barnett::: Amy Copeland::: this would be fun to do::: sit around on campus and reminisce. ❤️🐘,Have a great time and allow yourself time to enjoy frisbee on the quad::: get help as soon as possible::: make memories::: allow yourself to make mistakes (you are still growing)::: get plugged in to a local church::: CALL YOUR MOM::: get to know your advisor but do not rely on them solely when it comes to setting your schedule::: keep a journal::: make time for sleep::: eat::: drink water::: GO TO CLASS::: and ROLL TIDE ROLL!!!,Get involved but learn to say no if it is not convenient for you. Make each moment and memory count…study hard and enjoy your free time. Planning your schedule out with a planner will assist you with events throughout the week and with class times and assignments.,Walk the route you will take to classes prior to your first day. It helps you get familiar with the campus and know exactly where to go. I remember getting lost quite a few times my first few days on campus so I did this every year after my first year.,Dont get the vacine they may try to force you to get,not first day advice::: but overall advice - go to CLASS and your professors office hours. build relationships with your professors::: they will give you the benefit of the doubt when you need it. I literally overslept a final exam and my professor called my apt to check on me b/c I never missed a class.,Don’t forget to get your audit!!!!,Thanks in behalf of my granddaughter and others who are returning for their sophomore year; but did not get to learn the ropes due to Covid and virtual classes. I hope this helps every student who might feel a little like a freshman! God bless you all.🙏🏻,You can park wherever you want::: especially if you’re running late for class::: parking enforcement is very understanding and won’t give you 37 tickets. 🙂,Help me come back.,Student Life student staff (RAs::: Desk Assistants::: Recreation::: etc.) care about your success. Ask them questions! They usually have great access to resources and are better at not making asking for help and awkward situation,I Will be applying next fall ! Looking forward to this Lovely campus ! <3,Get involved in something::: anything! It’s the best way to make friends!,Call your mom!,Walk your schedule before classes start. Stay hydrated. And have a great time. Best years and friends of my life were made on that campus including my husband of 30 years. Roll Tide!,Have a great year! Roll Tide!🐘🏈🐘,Advice for bama students: transfer to Athens State::: move back home::: work full time::: get the same degree::: save a ton of money.,Figure out where your classes are!,Hit the books hard.,Go find all of your classes before the first day including the room number! In some of the buildings room 300 may not be on the 3rd floor.

"Update to UA mask policy ↓

The University of Alabama will require face coverings indoors on campus::: where and when distancing is not possible::: beginning Friday::: Aug. 6. This requirement applies to everyone::: regardless of vaccination status. Given the increase in COVID cases and recent CDC guidance::: UA is taking this step to further protect the Fall 2021 Semester.

With this new requirement::: masks must be worn:
-In classrooms and classroom buildings::: regardless of distancing
-In personal meeting spaces::: such as meetings with faculty and advisors
-When gathering in common spaces::: such as the Student Center
-On campus transportation

Exceptions include:
-Indoor areas when distanced
-When alone in offices and private workspaces
-In residence hall rooms
-While eating or drinking
-While exercising
-Faculty teaching::: if distanced and behind plexiglass

The indoor masking requirement is intended to be temporary and will be reviewed after the first two weeks of classes. Guidance and data are continually reviewed by medical professionals and administrators working with the campus Situational Response Team and the UA System Health and Safety Task Force.

“Vaccinations are the key to a successful fall semester and the key to moving beyond these types of requirements:::” stated Dr. Ricky Friend::: dean of the College of Community Health Sciences. “Everyone is strongly encouraged to be vaccinated. Data continue to show the vaccines provide very strong protection against serious illness and hospitalization.”

Schedule your vaccination appointment today::: or let us know if you’ve been vaccinated. Students who upload proof of vaccination will qualify for $20 Bama Cash.

“Our vaccine numbers among faculty and staff are strong — the percentage vaccinated more than doubles the statewide number. We are still learning about students who were vaccinated over the summer::: and will be offering expanded opportunities for vaccination as classes approach. Again::: vaccination is key:::” Friend said.

S. J. Fletcher
Guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment when caring for patients who are affected by highly infectious pathogens such as SARS::: avian influenza and tuberculosis include the use of high efficiency respirators that filter at least 95% of particles with a median diameter of 0.1 micron. These must therefore be close fitting to prevent air leakage [1::: 2]. A healthy intensivist (SF)::: wearing such a respirator (Tecnol Fluidshield PFR95::: Kimberly Clark Corporation::: Roswell::: GA) to perform a percutaneous tracheostomy on a patient with multidrug resistant pulmonary tuberculosis::: experienced dyspnoea::: tachycardia and tremor after 30 min. End-tidal carbon dioxide measured at the mouth by hand-held capnometry was 6.3 kPa (normal value 5.3 kPa). We postulated that the symptoms were due to hypercapnia.

We measured the end-tidal carbon dioxide levels in four anaesthetists wearing the same design of mask::: before and after performing tracheal intubation on another patient with pulmonary tuberculosis. Measurements were taken by sidestream capnometer (Poet LT::: Criticare::: Waukesha::: WI) using a 15-mm T-piece held between the lips. The mean baseline end-tidal carbon dioxide level was 5.18 kPa. Post-procedure (20 min later) the mean end-tidal carbon dioxide level was 5.95 kPa (p = 0.007). No subjects reported symptoms of hypercapnia. The rise in end-tidal carbon dioxide is due to rebreathing of expired alveolar gas that is ‘trapped’ in the respirator::: with the degree of rebreathing being proportional to the volume of the respirator (‘dead space’). It is likely that all tight-fitting::: high efficiency respirators will behave similarly::: with only the size of dead space varying between designs.

The respiratory response to hypercapnia is an increase in minute ventilation::: giving rise to the sensation of dyspnoea. Moderate (6.18 kPa) to high (7.5 kPa) levels of end-tidal carbon dioxide have also been shown to impair significantly cognitive and psychomotor performance and it is likely that this effect of carbon dioxide is dose related with no threshold []. Clearly::: our findings are of uncertain practical significance and further trials would be required employing cognitive and psychomotor measurements and arterial blood gas analysis.

In the event of an influenza pandemic::: large numbers of healthcare workers may need to wear these respirators for prolonged periods and problems with hypercapnia might reduce the tolerability of these devices. Whether psychomotor performance is affected also remains to be seen.",Valdosta State University,"Is the Medium Mass Vaccinated US (101 doses / 100 people::: 48% two doses::: 56% one dose - 16 July 2021) heading for a new covid wave and lockdown?

1. According to my insights high transmissibilit

2. Where in the mainstream media are the figures about deaths / cases for fully vaccinated people with maximum antibody level (> 2 weeks after the last dose) in comparison with other groups (unvaccinated::: partially vaccinated::: …)? I've seen news that the death percentage for the maximum antibody level group would be 6 fold that of the other groups and that antibodies from covid vaccines are less neutralising for the delta variant. See article links below::: page 12 of the second link and the first image further down. Is there an increased risk for ADE (antibody dependent enhancement) and antibody mediated enhancement of the disease with this delta and derived variants?

2. Facial protection for healthcare workers during pandemics: a scoping review
This study used 5462 peer-reviewed articles and 41 grey literature records.

“Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to critical shortages of medical-grade PPE. Alternative forms of facial protection offer inferior protection. More robust evidence is required on different types of medical-grade facial protection. As research on COVID-19 advances::: investigators should continue to examine the impact on alternatives of medical-grade facial protection”
So how is your cloth and surgical mask working again if EVEN medical grade alternatives are failing ?

Get or dont- to each their own but just stop!,Greg Farley,Grace Strickland,The fact they are bribing these kids with 20$ bama bucks to get the shot 😂😂😂,I talked to a 35 ish couple today. They both tested positive again.

Keeping students::: faculty and staff safe!,Those getting the s hot are passing it to the ones who dont,"Some of y'all need to stick to ""When is it going to hit the Dollar General by my aunt Flossie's house"" comments.",Few are wearing masks or taking vax. Alabama is covered up with covid. How is going to school for any making sense?,"The guidelines appear out of the protection of the Vaccine Passport bill... signed into law.

Lawsuits are coming .",Erika Williams,Sara Malin Roden,Just require the vaccination or have those that don’t adopt distance learning.,you prob already seen this but Amber Koger,You can still get covid if your vaccinated. You should be ashamed of yourselves.,🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️,If vaccinations are important and work why do vaccinated people have to wear masks which have been proven not to work? Fauci has stated this himself. Also::: why is a school known for producing lawyers blatantly violating everyone’s 9th and 10th Amendments?,This comments section reminds me why Facebook membership was initially limited to students of institutions of higher learning. Some of y’all don’t have a basic middle school understanding of this. 🤦,Just wondering do they still teach world history with facts only and no basis?,"Maybe you should offer free tutition for people who get the vaccine… this is insane! $20 in Bama Cash 😂😂😂
My husband and I paid plenty for our daughter to go to Bama out of state. We don’t regret one minute of her attending Bama::: but these liberal polices are nauseating",Something tells me a lot of the folks commenting here are not Alabama alumni::: students nor do they have children who attended U of A.,"HOW DOES THIS ANGER 94 PEOPLE THAT RESPONDED TO THIS POST?!?!???

Of course if it really bothers your kids I’m sure Ol Miss of FL will be mask free",As long as we don’t have to wear them at the games it’s whatever. I mean all I hear is the mask do no good::: vaccinated people still catch it::: it amazes me how much propel comply and know for a Fact nothing works. How bout we just deal with it? We have a lot more viruses and diseases that are a lot worse yet we carry in day to day::: this all started::: as we all know::: during the elections and I’m 99.99% positive that the dems and media caused panic for fake votes::: and for thing like this post to happen. SMDH. Don’t get the logic of wearing anything or sticking something in your body that we clearly know nothing about. Ignorance is bliss,Abby Montgomery Maddie Suber Lepianka David Garrett Zachary Mott,Disappointed.,Kassidy Lanigan,Ashley Gattis,Vaccines work but face coverings do not. The only face coverings that work are M95 and you have to be trained to use those and if your vaccinated you shouldn’t have to even wear mask.,Smart decision::: a minor inconvenience for some could be paramount in fighting this thing long term. Yall don't like it::: simply don't go::: whether it's school::: work or shopping. If you can't abide by a rule they are allowed to put in place as a private business then don't go.,Pathetic!,Late august::: 100:::000k fans… you are outdoors…. Bet they won’t lose that money two years in a row.,Amazing how this was the default gif available for everyone whining!,Jared Neighbors,Caleb Womble,Thank you for continuing to be a leader in keeping everyone safe and healthy!,This is insanity. It’s all about control. Wake up people. Your kids are being put through this but Biden has the border wide open and sending people into our cities. And it’s bad. Worse than what you hear on tv. I’m in Texas. It’s insanity. Why don’t we close the border instead of sending infected people in. Anyone asking that question. Biden needs to be impeached and his you know what thrown out of the White House. If they really cared they would close the border. Wake up people.,Y’all gonna wear these mask for the rest of your life’s?,Kelly Davis,Lol and yall thought getting vaccinated was gonna be the end of it 😂,"They are already saying booster shots will be needed so how is masking considered to be working 🤷‍♀️
Common sense has completely left the world!!!",About time::: things keep going at this rate::: there will be no fans at the games!,So there was no point in the ones who did get the vaccine. They were told if they did ::: no mask. So no point in the vaccine then huh.,Thank you The University of Alabama for keeping students and faculty safe 💕,Tabatha Nalls Sheppard,don’t worry abt me just screenshotting the antivaxxer comments for later,Common sense is gone.,I appreciate this mask mandate vs canceling greek activities::: closing rec center::: cancelling football ::: etc like last year. Everyone still has the right to not attend if you are not comfortable or don't want to follow the rule...I just appreciate them not shutting us down again like last year...,How many people in these comments upset about the mask requirements have no kids at the university::: don’t work at the university::: and therefore::: are not affected by this at all?

Thank you UA!,Morgan Dixon,Robert Howald,Sidney Alyn Atkins Jeremie Mayton,Y’all getting upset at an institution of higher learning for believing in science is beyond me.🙃,Outstanding and Very Appropriate!!! Protect our students::: faculty and visitors. Common sense and responsible. Roll Tide!!!,Well::: If they go by this guideline::: mask will be required in the football stadium. ( can't social distance),Meanwhile while on the strip::: im sure the students will be masked right up 😂😂😂,Glad I’m a Bama by Distance student.,Great❤️,Get that vaxx.. but keep wearing that face diaper 🙄 ... makes perfect sense 🤣,So you can catch it when your eating or exercising?,Kyle Thornton,What a bunch of Sheep. !!!! You make me sick.,Vax incentives. BAMA Cash. That's Awesome.,Good,Exactly how many college age people have died from the delta variant? What a stupid rule coming out of my school.,BS,🙌,Keep in mind no quarantine measures / mandate... This is key wording. So this means those that are exposed are still in class::: in the dorm::: on the strip. Why the mask mandate if no quarantine measures?,Stephanie McAleer,Katelyn Thomas,Excellent news! Roll Tide! Troglodytes can stay home.,Roll tide,Is the setting at Bryant stadium going to be limited again this season not that Covid is in the rise again.,What a shame to see so many people getting insanely upset over a mask... 🙄 and a school trying to take some kind of precautions to protect its staff and students. Why don't yall find something else to be mad about?!,Bad move::: they should be mandating the vaccine to attend::: like our universities are doing up north. Have fun getting sick this semester all you insanely stupid unvaccinated peeps. ✌🏼,Abby Lawson,Why the F would I get a vaccine if you gonna make me wear a mask anyway??? What is the point? If a vaccinated person can still get the virus and still pass the virus on...what is the point?,Veronica Bjorkman,"Show me anywhere on the box that a mask comes in where it says it works? Stop this b*******. If our underwear and jeans can't stop a fart::: a mask doesn't do jack s***. And it says that on the box.

The vaccination doesn't work. This is a b******* scam and we all know it. Even the CDC had to reluctantly admit that you can still get sick with a vaccination and die.

You know what does work? The same drugs that our leaders in DC are allowed to take but we're not when they get diagnosed with covid. Works so good that within 10 days of them being diagnosed they're back to work. We can't even talk about those drugs or we face consequences. They'd rather us get really sick::: go to the hospital::: get medically induced into a coma::: to get ventilated and ultimately die. Why? Big money. When the hospitals are paid a bounty for you to die and be ventilated. Why give you the drugs that can save your life?

Those drugs don't cost anything for a profit. $39:::000 to ventilate you::: $13:::000 if you die and they can list it as covid paid by Medicaid::: our government and ultimately us the taxpayers. In other words we fund our own deaths.

The drugs Ivermectin is the answer but it cost only dollars and it already has an FDA approval. But they're not pushing that because the big pharmacy gets big dollars paid by us the taxpayers which in turns fattens the pockets of the investors like Nancy Pelosi. Look that up. She bought stock last year before the vaccine push.

Shame on Alabama.

Stop messing with the students that pay your salaries.",Maryah Mott,Devyn Tankersley,Keith Dutton,Very disappointing. Not a good sign -\-\ seems the school is caving in to fear instead of promoting individual responsibility and individual choices.,Why vaccinate if this is how you are going to treat them?This is so WRONG.,Ugh.,Here we go…a bunch of people whining about their “Freedoms” being taken away. Broken record…,Just following the CDC guidance to protect the unvaccinated around them. Hopefully this will give us time to get closer to herd immunity. Remember some are unable to get vaccinated.,Please tell us your plan for Bryant Denny Stadium,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Building Bama update: The 2nd Avenue Overpass opens the morning of Wednesday::: August 4! 💯 The days of having to wait for a train to pass to get to and from campus will soon be in the rearview mirror::: as this new entryway to campus connects 15th Street to Paul W.

The University of Alabama is honored to recognize the first official Juneteenth holiday - the day that marks an effective end to slavery in the United States! Juneteenth is the day when federal troops arrived in Galveston::: Texas::: in 1865 to take control of the state and ensure that all enslaved people be freed::: and is considered the longest-running African American holiday. Information on local celebrations: https://bit.ly/3gDGMPq,2021-06-19 15:00:57,Stacy Linn Moon,"I am very thankful for the Republican party for realizing that all men are created equal and to be free and thankful that the Republican party voted 100% for the 13th 14th and 15th amendment. No man should be held and suppression like the Democrats have held the black community and for decades Let’s remember it was LBJ that said he would have every ni..er voting Democrat for a life . Let’s remember after the Clive war it was the Democratic Party who formed the KKK. Let’s remember Margaret Sanger the founder of Planned Parenthood who was a Democrat in formed planned parenthood to kill off the black community because she said they were like weeds. Let’s remember George Wallace Democrat who blocked the university of Alabama to keep the blacks out. Let’s remember it was a conservative Democrat who by today standards would be considered a republican JFK who stepped in and put it into this. Let’s remember Joe Biden saying that integrating schools will create ‘a racial jungle' and that he did not want his children to grow up in a 'racial jungle' Let remember it was the republicans Who in the filibuster of the civil rights act of 64
So yes today I am proud that the Republican party who fought for the black community and help free them of the suppression the democratic party has held them in.",When Republicans freed slaves from democrats.,"Basically::: diverting credit from Abe Lincoln(a republican):::and
his Emancipation Proclamation to Joe Biden(a Democrat). Cornpop would be proud.",It is an overreach to say that this limited exposure event in Galveston effectively ended slavery in the United States. The 13th Amendment was not yet ratified - that would take effect later in the year on December 6th and the Emancipation Proclamation did not address slavery in states that had not seceded.,"When I saw this post::: I knew the South wouldn’t disappoint me in the comments. 🥰

Yes::: I also know they don’t represent everyone in the South. RTR",I agree with honoring a day that ended a horrific part of history with the holiday. What I don’t like is the colors of the African flag as part of it. After all::: it was the people of Africa who were selling their own people into slavery. So yes::: honor the ending of slavery with pride. But::: with the American flag::: not this.,🤦🏼‍♂️,What a great country this is! Those people must have been thrilled to death and scared to death all at once!,Happy Father's Day weekend,Cullman showing out today,In the booty,Is it not ironic that UA recognizes Juneteenth::: “the day that marks an effective end to slavery:::” yet most of the campus is still named after the Confederacy???,American Holiday,"This is how ya’ll should be celebrating...j
ust like when they black selves scores a TD and yall get a hard on for em lmao....enjoy the day off and thank a black person and quite being so dam miserable 😂",Well now it’s the month of February and now in June. What’s next remove Christmas and celebrate George Floyd month then remove thanks giving and celebrate Jesse Jackson month. This crap is never going to end. Give them what they want and still not satisfied and keeps wanting more. None of these people were around during them poor slaves days. Them people suffered the way no one should be treated. Instead of trying to unite to make things better they go and try separating the races.,We need more European troops come here.,So only black folks will recieve the day off?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The latest message from President Bell ↓

Dear Students::: Faculty and Staff:

I know you join me in applauding the historic efforts of Coach Nate Oats and our men’s basketball team as they claimed the SEC regular season and tournament championships on their way to the NCAA Tournament Sweet 16. Congratulations::: as well::: to Coach Kristy Curry and the women’s basketball team for their first appearance in the NCAA tournament in over two decades. We also celebrate Coach Dana Duckworth and the gymnastics team for winning another SEC Championship; they will host the 2021 NCAA Gymnastics Regional this weekend in Coleman Coliseum. And::: UA runner Mercy Chelangat claimed an individual NCAA Cross Country Championship with the best individual finish in school history. Results like these leave no room for doubt; our student-athletes rank among the elite in the nation.

As our academic achievements attest::: our success extends well beyond the athletic arena. We are very proud of UA’s leadership in transformational education::: leading-edge research and inspirational service. The School of Law was recently ranked No. 25 on the list of best law graduate schools in the nation and ninth among public law schools for 2022 by U.S. News and World Report. Special recognition is also due for UA senior Kathleen McManus for being named PRWeek’s 2021 Outstanding Student; she credits faculty mentoring within UA’s Department of Advertising and Public Relations for much of her success. In addition::: please join me in honoring the three UA students who received a Critical Language Scholarship to study overseas this summer::: furthering their opportunities to contribute to the U.S. economy and to issues of national security.

As we move into April::: proud UA students and alumni will be receiving their class rings through a special ring ceremony::: an important tradition for conveying the Capstone spirit. From athletic triumphs to academic success::: The University of Alabama remains the place Where Legends Are Made.

Finally::: we continue to see low COVID-positive numbers and increasing vaccination rates::: supporting our plan to return to normal operations for the Fall 2021 Semester. Thank you for your continued vigilance in our ongoing efforts to protect our campus community.

Roll Tide!

"Highlights from Dr. Bell’s latest message ↓

I hope our students were able to take advantage of yesterday’s wellness/study day to recharge and prepare for the stretch run of the spring semester.

This past weekend many of our student-athletes were busy winning championships on the national stage. Our Adapted Athletics women’s basketball team registered its seventh national title since 2009. Our men’s basketball team topped a record-breaking regular season with an SEC Tournament title. Both the men’s and women’s teams have advanced to the NCAA Tournament with the men matching a program-best No. 2 seed while the women earned a spot in the Big Dance for the first time since 1999.

Congratulations are in order for Dr. David L. Albright::: who was recently recognized as a Distinguished Research Professor by the University of Alabama Board of Trustees. Dr. Albright is internationally recognized for his scholarly work regarding military social work and is regarded as a thought leader in the area of veteran health and well-being.

I’d like to congratulate and welcome our new Student Government Association executives led by incoming president Jill Fields. We look forward to working with you and the positive impact you will make on the Capstone.

We have made tremendous progress this spring and I remain grateful for your collective efforts to advance our mission and remain Tide Together.

Alabama Adapted athlete Peter Berry has a drive and passion that helped position him to play with the best - and now this freshman will be playing for a National Championship this weekend. How he faced tragedy and turned it into the opportunity to push forward and succeed ↓

Rick Karle WVTM 13
March 8 at 1:39 PM ·

The great news just keeps on coming for Crimson Tide athletics.
Yes::: Bama has reeled in the number one recruit in America.
He::: in fact is already enjoying his freshman year at the Capstone.
He will be playing for a national championship this weekend.

Star athletes such as DeVonta Smith and Najee Harris have departed.
John Petty and Herb Jones will soon be on their way out.
I'm here to tell you that the new BMOC is a strong::: handsome athlete from Houston.
An athlete that has not walked in nearly ten years.

This is the story about a tragedy.
It’s also the story about resiliency and success.
It’s a story about a 19-year-old who is educating the world.
It’s a story about Bama's next superstar.

Peter Berry lifts himself out of bed at 4:30 am.
There is work to do as he heads to team weight training at 5:30 am.
His brow sweats and his voice grunts as he gets after it.
He looks forward to breakfast::: then class::: then four hours of afternoon practice.

Peter Berry has needed that drive::: needed that passion.
It’s that drive and that passion that has brought him back from his darkest day.
It’s a day that Peter will never forget.
A day that came on July 2nd::: 2011 on a highway some 500 miles from his Texas house.

Josh and Robin Berry were the greatest parents ever.
Their three kids- Peter::: Aaron::: the little one::: Willa::: so precious::: so full of life.
Josh was a stern dad::: but oh::: how he loved his kids.
Josh and Robin had big plans for their kids::: who in 2011 were all under the age of ten.

They were in the home stretch of a wonderful trip to Colorado.
It happened in a flash as the distracted driver crossed lanes.
Life changed for Peter::: Aaron and the little one::: Willa.
Their parents were gone.
The children were rushed to a hospital::: clinging to life.

It was 2012::: and Uncle Matt and Aunt Simone were rooting for the children they had taken in.
They prayed for strength as Peter and Aaron were in rehab after their injuries::: both to the T-10 vertebrae.
Peter and Aaron were paralyzed from the waist down::: and the little one::: Willa::: had a long road back.
And as Matt and Simone loved their nephews and niece::: an amazing thing was about to happen

Peter Berry was only ten years old::: his brother a year younger.
A year removed from their darkest hour::: their hearts pumped as they arrived on the court.
Perhaps it offered Peter a way to release some aggression::: some pain.
Perhaps it took his mind off his darkest day.
The sport of wheelchair basketball had met its match.

For eight years::: he kept telling himself.
“The ability to overcome obstacles is mental.”
Peter Berry would develop his game and grind away.
Morning after morning of lifting weights.
Shot after shot after shot.

For eight years::: Peter Berry was angry::: happy::: sad::: hopeful.
It’s what drove him to become America’s top high school wheelchair basketball player.
Sore muscles::: calloused hands::: bruised arms.
And he wanted more.

More would come from the University Of Alabama.
The college known for winning national titles… in adapted athletics.
So as his cell phone lit up with offers from everywhere::: the kid from Houston signed his scholarship.
In January of 2020::: he was headed to Tuscaloosa- alone::: but intrigued.

Peter Berry tells me that the University Of Alabama has been a perfect fit.
Professors::: coaches::: teammates and students have been kind.
Oh::: and how he loves the southern hospitality.

It’s a big week for the university’s next superstar.
Peter and his teammates are working hard::: as the Alabama Adapted Athletics men’s wheelchair team will gun for another national title.
Coach Brent Hardin and the guys will host the national championship starting Friday.
First up for the Crimson Tide?
The Auburn Tigers.

The University Of Alabama’s next superstar is grinding on and teaching us all.
“You must force yourself to be positive in the wake of setbacks”::: Peter tells me.
“Expose yourself to positive books::: videos::: people. Negativity will only set you back.”

Just thinking about the future gets Peter Berry excited.
His younger brother Aaron will join him at UA next year.
His sister Willa? She’s attending boarding school in Colorado.
Uncle Matt and Aunt Simone reach out daily.

Nearly ten years after his darkest day::: Peter Berry is not looking behind::: but looking ahead.
Perhaps to the Paralympic games::: perhaps to settling down.
“I hope that my economics degree someday leads to a good job”::: says Peter.
“I’d like to get married and have a family.”

For now::: Peter Berry will continue to rise at 4:30 am::: working out::: going to class.

He continues to be a blessing to others.

He continues to represent the University Of Alabama with grace and class.

That::: my friend::: is Peter Berry.

The University Of Alabama’s next superstar.

"A couple of highlights from Dr. Bell's latest message ↓

Last week::: The University of Alabama System announced plans for a return to traditional in-person instruction without classroom capacity restrictions for the Fall 2021 Semester. As we plan for the fall::: we will continue to work with the UA System Health and Safety Task Force and monitor recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Alabama Department of Public Health to ensure the well-being of our entire UA community. And::: while we currently have a record low number of COVID-positive students::: faculty and staff::: continuing to follow recommended safety measures is essential for our ongoing progress.

A reminder for our students: As you continue to prioritize your academic focus this semester::: don’t forget Monday::: March 15::: is a non-instructional wellness and study day. It’s important to set aside time to rest and reflect so you can recharge and finish the semester strong.

With an ongoing emphasis on testing and the continuation of our vaccine distribution::: we have seen a steady decline in positive COVID-19 cases. Because of the talented staff at our Student Health Center and University Medical Center::: symptomatic and exposure testing continue to run smoothly and remain available for everyone in our UA community.

The Student Health Center’s medical professionals have dedicated long hours to serving our students over the past year::: providing a skilled standard of care that has been both indispensable and impressive. I sincerely appreciate their servant leadership.

This week we continue our celebration of Black History Month. Please make time to visit the Diversity::: Equity and Inclusion website to review the special programming to showcase African American culture and to support our path forward as an accepting::: inclusive community. Join me in honoring the many black students::: alumni::: faculty and staff who have positively shaped UA’s history and legacy by learning more about their contributions and accomplishments.

Our legendary faculty and alumni contribute to our communities and the world with a pioneering impact on projects beyond the realm of our planet. Our revolutionary work as leaders in research::: service and teaching continues in earnest and with unrivaled excellence.

Students::: I hope you will continue to set and pursue SMART goals to aid your focus on academic success. Learning is a lifelong process::: and our dedicated faculty and staff are here to walk beside you on the journey toward a remarkable future.

"Important Sentinel Testing Information ↓

To help prevent the spread of coronavirus::: COVID-19 sentinel testing of campus community members will continue in Spring 2021::: with more frequent testing scheduled the first three weeks of the semester.

Beginning this semester::: all sentinel testing will be managed through UA medical facilities::: so registration is no longer required. Participants will receive incentives like Starbucks or Bama Cash gift cards::: or other items.

Sentinel testing captures a random sampling of students::: faculty and staff to help monitor the prevalence of COVID-19 so UA can respond promptly to outbreaks or increases in infection rates.

Participation in sentinel testing is voluntary for most::: but required for:
- Students living on campus.
- Students participating in clinical activities::: who will have a presence on campus at any time during the semester.
- Other individuals participating in University-sponsored programs::: at the discretion of UA.

Because sentinel testing is one of several important measures for preventing the spread of the coronavirus and keeping campus safe::: voluntary participation is strongly encouraged.

If randomly selected::: individuals will receive an email from the COVID-19 Support Program with instructions. Participants will choose a time and location to take the test conveniently::: confidentially::: and at no cost. A PCR test with a short nasal swab will be self-administered under observation::: and results returned within 72 hours.

"Message from President Bell ↓

Today is the first day of the Spring semester::: and I am delighted to welcome you home to Tuscaloosa and to your campus community. A new semester is always exciting – an opportunity full of promise and possibility.

What better way to begin than by claiming our hard-earned position as national champions! Monday night’s victory accentuates the continued excellence and integrity of our program. Congratulations to our outstanding student-athletes::: Coach Nick Saban and our skilled coaching staff for a triumphant season. I am proud of how they represented the University both on and off the field.

The gatherings that followed the game underscore the need for continued vigilance and caution by every member of our community. For this reason::: we have given faculty and students the flexibility for remote learning for the next two weeks.

Our faculty and staff have worked very hard to prepare for a successful spring. Despite the unique challenges we faced in the fall::: we persisted and prevailed in finishing the semester and celebrating our graduates. We must continue our combined efforts to protect each other and stay healthy. We have hindsight to inform us::: and medical experts who continue to advise us on how to remain safely on campus for the spring semester. I implore you to continue to do your part. Stay vigilant and follow the important health and safety standards we have in place.

Student::: faculty and staff testing will increase this spring::: including sentinel::: exposure::: symptomatic and for-cause testing. Through comprehensive testing::: we will continue to reduce virus spread and provide prompt support for those who may become infected. The health and well-being of our community remain our highest priority.

Faculty and staff::: as our students pursue their interests in our state-of-the-art facilities with your support and expertise::: I remain grateful for your continued commitment. You play an essential role in their experiences and success::: and your contributions to our mission are crucial.

It is going to be another great semester at The University of Alabama. Welcome back – and::: of course::: ROLL TIDE!

"Important Spring Semester Update from Dr. Bell ↓

Happy New Year! I hope you have remained healthy and are well rested following winter break.

Congratulations to DeVonta Smith on winning the Heisman Trophy last night as the most outstanding player in college football! We are very proud of DeVonta and the entire football program for the way they have represented Alabama and look forward to cheering them on in the National Championship!

Our team is working hard to prepare for your return to campus::: meeting often over the holidays::: reviewing plans and monitoring COVID-19 trends in our community. We continue to receive guidance from the UA System Health and Safety Task Force::: and with their support::: campus operations will resume on Jan. 7 with adjusted or staggered work schedules and classes on Jan. 13.

A thorough review of our fall testing and contact tracing data confirmed our health and safety protocols kept campus locations such as classrooms and common areas safe. As we return to campus life::: we must all remain vigilant in following our health and safety protocols::: including masking and social distancing.

To continue to maintain a safe campus in the spring::: we have enhanced a few aspects of our plans:

- Students living on campus will be required to test within seven days of their return to campus.
- COVID testing will be conducted by University Medical Center and Student Health Center staff.
- Testing for our entire campus community will increase::: including sentinel testing.
- Exposure::: symptomatic and for-cause testing will continue as in the fall.
- Spring semester will begin with a two-week moratorium on all student events.

Details of our spring plans are posted at healthinfo.ua.edu. Please visit this site regularly for the most up-to-date information and important campus announcements.

Thank you again for all that you do as part of our community::: and we look forward to having you back.

I am 24::: an undergraduate student @ Enugu State University. I have passion for education but unfortunately::: due to numerous personal challenges::: I can't make it to continue. I have decided to sacrifice all to leave my country. I sincerely wish there is any assistance in terms of any little job opportunity in Alabama for foreigners; even if it warrants that I will have to pay my first few months salary to you in appreciation; I will forever be grateful::: regardless. I humbly wish I'm lucky for a response.
I will answer every single question from anybody who may want to authenticate my identity before assistance.",Go Bama Go,Roll Tide Roll,Wish I didn't blow out my knee back in '84. We probably would have one more National Championship. Me and Mike Jox were gonna start at our positions. Me at Quarter Back him at Wide Receiver. We have played together since 1970 when we where kids. But our Linebacker Joey Moxx tore my ACL and Mike could not stay healthy with all his Head Injuries. The only time I've played was against Kentucky back in '83. 53 yards for the Touchdown and we won 63 to 2 then coach said I got the starting job that spring then Joey Moxx got my ACL I then became a plummer. Mike died back in the 80s I miss him. RTR,Fantastic pictures!

"Highlights from Dr. Bell’s latest message ↓

- The eyes of the world were on our university and the University of Alabama System when we announced our goal of opening safely in August. Many institutions around the country followed our model::: and once again our people led by example.
- A robust testing program has served as a critical component to our success this semester. University Medical Center::: the Student Health Center and our campus partners have administered more than 80:::000 tests over the past four months.
- As a reminder: free exit testing is available for students at Coleman Coliseum. Scheduling an exit test is a smart::: practical way to protect you::: your family and your hometown community. Appointments will fill quickly::: so please schedule your free test as soon as possible.
- The work of the Presidential Advisory Committee for Diversity::: Equity and Inclusion::: led by Dr. Christine Taylor and her team::: has been another signal achievement of 2020. They produced a comprehensive report that will be an essential guide star for our continued progress.
- At a time when public health dominates the global spotlight::: we are pleased to share the news that Dr. Heather Carter-Templeton::: a professor in the Capstone College of Nursing::: has been inducted into the American Academy of Nursing 2020 Class of Fellows.

“My family and I are deeply thankful for the faculty::: staff and students here at the Capstone. Our faculty have risen to the occasion and developed innovative instruction methods to connect with students. The transformational educational opportunities for which we are known are changing lives::: and our stature as a leader among research universities continues to soar. Best wishes for safe travels and good health during the holiday season.”

"Each UA student is offered one free exit test as they leave for Thanksgiving and winter holidays. An appointment is required::: and available time slots are filling up fast. Students should schedule their appointment to meet travel needs.

Students need to be sure to research testing requirements for airlines or travel destinations::: which may include a negative test::: and plan to schedule an exit test accordingly. Exit tests provided on campus are “rapid” or antigen tests that offer results quickly. If a PCR test is required for travel::: students must find it from another source. Students are required to bring their ACT card::: CWID and government-issued ID to their exit test.

"UA’s President’s Advisory Committee for Diversity::: Equity and Inclusion released its comprehensive report::: “Path Forward:::” which includes strategies for ongoing coordination and expansion of UA’s DEI efforts. The report builds on the University’s strategic plan goal to enrich learning and work environments by providing an accepting::: inclusive community that attracts and supports a diverse faculty::: staff and student body.

“I am proud of the thoughtful work of this committee to actively identify practices that will enhance the UA experience for all students::: faculty and staff:::” said President Stuart R. Bell. “This is personal and critical for me::: and it strengthens our campus-wide commitment to fostering a culture of inclusivity.”

The committee of faculty::: staff and students focused on:
- Increasing and retaining underrepresented students::: faculty and staff
- Enhancing the campus community to help them thrive
- Providing opportunities to develop cultural competencies
- Implementing the recommendations

The preliminary report was presented to Bell in late September::: and progress has already been seen on campus. The University launched enhanced diversity student recruitment efforts with new multicultural visitation and orientation programs this summer::: and opened its updated and enhanced Intercultural Diversity Center on the second floor of the Ferguson Center in October.

If you felt excluded::: why would you attend there??,What the hell is happening to the University?,Hooray!!,Diversity as a forced concept just moves us into a direction I’m not sure many of us want to go. I’m an Alumni and there couldn’t have been a more diverse population on campus when I attended (class of 80). It was multi ethnic::: cultural::: a virtual UN of students. I had friends from all over the world. I was in the minority in my dorm (I’m white). Unless something has drastically changed in the student population::: this is just an exercise in PCness. It’s just a college trying to prove their liberalism the silliest way possible.,Demarcus Rudolph,You can get the same thing in Basic Training!,"So... if I wore my Border Patrol Cap
and my Back-The-Blue T-shirt
with my Trump 2020 Pin
... would I be allowed in to this
'Division of Diversity::: Equity::: Inclusion and Intercultural Diversity Center' ??","Ridiculous::: 'Bama.
Get real!",PSA: UA has had an IDC forever::: it was just in the Riverside annex. This comment section 🥴🥴,I am beyond sad to read the negative comments on this post. I’m glad the University is showing where it stands on diversity and inclusion. When you know better::: you do better. Who stands to lose from this?,This waste of money is why I refuse to donate money. It is wasted on leftwing crap like this.,More kind control that only serves to cause further divisions::: yes- I am one of those white guys that you want to blame for everything.,This right here is the reason my family has withdrawn all extra financial support and donations!,"Wasted money-people wonder why student debt is so high? Financing facilities like this gets passed on to the students-perhap
s not all of the cost::: but a significant chunk. Students need to ask::: ""is $1500 in additional student loan debt worth me paying for this?"". If they polled the student body::: what would the answer have been?","What a load of BULL!!!!! I’m disgusted with this money-wasting political nonsense. Look::: 1963 was a loooong time ago. The U is fully integrated::: and including sports. We’ve had a black Homecoming Queen::: SGA presidents (including one in my day):::affirmativ
e action::: quotas::: legislation::: court orders::: special programs::: etc etc etc. What more do they need to do???? The modern answer should be - nothing! Everyone needs get that enormous chip off their shoulder and stop demanding special treatment::: and just go about the business of living their lives. We don’t need to keep digging away at the open wound of racism and slavery and white-people (especially WM) are bad::: etc etc. Enough!!!! UA C&BA ‘76.",These comments speak volumes. How sad. I am so glad that my university is taking a definitive stand to promote diversity::: equity::: and inclusion on its campus!! Roll tide!!,"When I went to UA (C&IS Class of 2004 woop woop!) I visited the diversity center and Rotary International::: and made lifelong friends from all over the world. I went to meetings and speeches where people from all walks of life taught me more than can be found in a textbook. They shared the feelings and emotions behind world events that I had only seen on the news. I felt like I was part of a global community with global responsibilitie
s. My purpose became greater. Programs like this are worth every penny because the reward is priceless. If you can't see the value of true engagement with other cultures then... you're probably one of the reasons why our country is tearing itself apart now. I'm proud of my alma mater everyday::: but especially today. RTR 4 EVER.",Question for the Facebook Anti-Diversity League: Are y’all still boycotting Alabama football due to the march to Foster::: or did y’all forget about that? #RollTide,🤮,this comment section hurts my heart 😞,Congrats 🎉,From the comments I went to the wrong university lol. Y’all really don’t like black people bro,Excellent!,What in Sam hell is the point of the center?,Imagine being forced to listen to the pig Jane Elliott. Even if you listen to music the whole time Jane's face isn't exactly easy on the eyes.,Whew the racism jumped out honey.,Alabama don’t like black people and it definitely showing🥴,Well::: here’s some more great news... The Intercultural Diversity Center has already been on campus since at least 2015! They’re expanding their program to a bigger platform. What a wonderful occasion to celebrate years of hard work on campus to make diversity::: equity::: and inclusion a priority at the capstone.,All I see is a bunch of old white men outing themselves for being racist. This comment section is disgusting.,“Efforts” like the effort you made with Jane Elliott?? The office still hasn’t contacted me yet from my messages left.,So basically you created a liberal Democrat club that rejects anyone who does not agree with their viewpoint or agenda? U of A is going down the same path as the liberal Universities..,"We need to abandon this notion that diversity is somehow inherently virtuous.

Ask the Romans::: the Russians::: the Mexicans::: and the American Indian about ""diversity"" sometime.",Diversity of thought is the most important diversity and yet its lacking at almost every college and university.,So great to see everyone in the same room. Can we get the students back in the same room with their professors?,How racist do you have to be to take issue with a Diversity Center? 😳,The University has done just fine since 1831 without this,We are supposed to be a melting pot.

That would include the Texas A&M game and his travels to the field::: press box::: locker room and suites...and no quarantines from any of this?

"“I am proud of your continued commitment to our mission and remain grateful for your support. Tide Together::: we will persist and prevail.”

President Bell provided the following updates in his weekly email:

- For the third successive week::: positive COVID cases at the University have dropped dramatically: https://uasystem.edu/covid-19-dashboard/

- Last week we saw a 60 percent decrease in student positives and record lows in occupancy of our isolation/quarantine space.

- Effective today::: and with safety measures in place::: UA student organizations can begin hosting non-social engagement events that support their mission.

- Class schedules for spring will be published next week and we have recently announced a modified spring academic calendar. First and foremost::: we will see greater in-class learning opportunities for students across the board and on-campus residence will continue as normal in the spring.

- This weekend our 2020 game day protocols will enable us to provide a safe and enjoyable experience for all fans visiting Bryant Denny Stadium. Whether enjoying a watch party from home or cheering from the stands::: it will be an exciting afternoon of SEC football: https://bit.ly/2020UAGamedayExperience

For additional details::: please see the full message at: http://bit.ly/PresidentBellMessageOct1",2020-10-01 21:42:01,That tends to happen when people who get exposed to COVID get told to quarantine and not get tested. Granted::: that *is* the right policy::: but the falling positivity right is more precipitous than the actual decline likely is. The University has made positive steps in accountability (e.g. they began showing the amount of quarantine housing they have::: rather than just reporting the proportion of beds filled - which was extremely deceptive when they were clearing dorms of students)::: but to get a better picture of what's happening there should be further efforts to increase accountability.,Bell and his cadre of idiots need to resign !!!

The administration:::
like all others in education::: are caught between a rock and a hard place. I side with caution and keeping our kids safe. I wonder how many of these people complaining were the parents who didn’t wear a mask when moving their kids into the dorms.

-Spring break will be canceled for continuous learning to mitigate risks associated with travel.

-The last day for students to add/drop classes without a “W” is Wednesday::: Jan. 20.

-Classes will be canceled on Monday::: March 15::: as a wellness/study day mid-semester::: but offices will remain open.

Classes will look much the same as they do this semester::: with the majority having an in-person component and remote options in case a student or faculty member needs to quarantine or isolate.

Additional information::: including holiday information for faculty and staff and spring semester health and safety protocols: http://bit.ly/UASpringSemesterChanges2021",2020-09-30 18:00:03,What?!?! So premature- those kids are teaching THEMSELVES many subjects because so many professors are not doing anything but pre-recorded lectures. They are working incredibly hard::: are locked down::: harrassed by police::: told they have to wear masks in the shower and feel like every move they make is scrutinized under a microscope. Many of them are stressed to the absolute max. Cancelling spring break now is only adding to the stress and is completey ridiculous. Please reconsider this bad decision.,I think it’s too early to make this decision. And I sincerely hope you have on campus::: in person instruction next semester.,This should have been done when the fall schedule was changed. Super poor planning and bad for the morale of employees and students.,Unless they start teaching live they will all still go on spring break. They can’t stop that except by forcing there professors to actually go to work,This entire online /hybrid learning is awful. My student couldn't log on to an online test and has the texts to prove he was telling the professor during the test time. When he could finally log on he had 13 MINUTES to complete the test The professor couldn't care less. The head of the department would not answer my emails because she says he hasn't given permission which is inaccurate. The only resolution was we will see what the end of the semester brings. Complete bull$$$$. Now he has a D+ and As and Bs in everything else. I'm am beyond frustrated. And before you think I'm a complaining parent I can tell you in 10 years of my kids college I have never had to try to advocate for them !!! UA really needs to get there situation under control,"Bullsh—!!! UA- don’t carry this nonsense into next year!!!!! I’d urge any student to transfer out !!!!! Enough! These stupid and harsh measures are completely unwarranted by the facts!!! 99.96 % recovery rate. And exactly HOW many students have been hospitalized?!!
!! UA- stop this nonsense!!!!!",It’s not enough to take away in person classes and all social activities. Now they take spring break too. Six months in advance! Ridiculous!,How ridiculous! And you are hurting these kids just for show! If you believe in science and statistics at all::: you know darn well that almost every kid on the campus could get this and barely notice! They would be FINE!!! Plus::: it’s the best thing that could happen for herd immunity. Any student or teacher who is super susceptible because they have some other condition is welcome to function remotely. What about the VACCINE that is just being finished?? That’s not enough for you either?? May I ask::: are you planning to operate this way for every flu season? If not::: examine your hypocrisy! The flu is more dangerous to college-age people than this Coronavirus is. Your nonsense and non-teaching is not worth the cost we parents are paying.,It’s the cancelling spring break but turning honors day into honors week for me,I’ve been a strong supporter of bamas Covid plans A-Z but cancelling spring break all together???? Y’all. Spring break for us students was a chance to feel free again. To erase all the pressures of college. To rebel and party. And then like 1 day to catch up on projects and stuff we were behind in all semester. I really hope like the fall has changed so too the spring can change,How many of our kids are going to say hell NO::: we are celebrating Spring Break ::: because we need that time to relax and unwind!!! I already told my daughter who is a senior this year to do what ever she wants with her friends!!! Its her last year to enjoy college life and its bad enough that their football tickets were taken from them and now they only get two games!!! WTH!!! I used to think Alabama was one of the best colleges but the way they have treated our students during this time is more then ridiculous!!! VERY DISAPPOINTED IN UA!!!,"Bravo!
UA shows the way!",Happy Son’s Day::: Dr. Myron L. Pope!,Cancelling Spring Break - - ludicrous under the circumstances and given the facts and science on this virus!,"https://

It is the fact that spring semester will be just like fall. Most classes are online. My son is a freshman and the online classes aren’t working for him. Many students need the structure that going to an in-person class provides. Some students are self-motivated but many are not.,This is absurd,Many people have non refundable vacations planned.,A little early to call Spring break,All the money with half the teaching.,"Just tell them you have COVID that week.

I believe that's checkmate::: UA.",UA sucks. I have 2 kids there. I can say that. Bunch of poor leadership.,As a parent of 2 kids at Bama::: my patience level with these threats and restrictions is reaching a limit. Even Auburn let their kids go to the game. ENOUGH!,Avery Holsomback Laney Rodriguez,I’m just worried about how preemptive this is as March is 5 months away. Are we really preparing for everything to still be as terrible as it is now that far out? I hope things are at least somewhat better by then::: Covid-wise.,alabama u just broke my heart man,OPEN THE SCHOOL UP! This is absurd!! I have two kids there. They’re lost with all of this online stuff and struggling. Both of my kids were A students but not anymore. They’ve both done online tutoring blah blah blah! THEY NEED IN CLASS INSTRUCTIONS. They deserve what we PAID for and they are not getting it. They WILL not be there next year if this keeps going the way it’s been going .,As alumni and parents we have supported UA for decades. We are extremely disappointed with many of the decisions leadership has made relating to the students over the past six months. They are losing us and many other families like us. When will they realize? When it’s too late-,Donna Rogers Upton🙄,This is infuriating. Where is the leadership???,So stupid!! Your students are failing and you are ignoring this fact!! Your dropout rate is going to explode.,This is completely insane & pathetic,I’m disappointed that spring break is cancelled. Students and faculty need the break for mental health wellness. This has been really tough on the students.,You think kids are gonna come to class just because you canceled Spring Break? You’re dreaming.,Find another school,This really has to end at some point.,Thank you for all you are doing to try to keep faculty::: staff::: students::: and all community members safe.,Kids will still go on spring break! A college does not control their lives!,This is happening at many schools now across the country. Hearing the same from friends.,one day in the middle of the semester is definitely a great mental health break🥰 thanks so much for looking out for your students xx,I can deal with all of it except giving the kids a choice of whether or not to attend class in person. I mean::: seriously::: what do you think most kids will choose?? That’s not a quality education by any stretch of the imagination.,Really disappointed...,Im confused about the statement about in-class learning being the majority of how classes are being taught this semester. This semester 4 of 5 of my Daughter’s classes are remote and the 5th only meets in class one day a week. I really hope most will be in-class next semester.,"I have one son at UA and another supposed to come their next year::: but his is ridiculous. Next year when half your students are gone you will realize that y’all are a bunch of idiot. Cancelling spring break six months ahead of time is stupid. Why not wait until closer til time. You are not letting college kids be college kids . Giving tickets for not having a mask on even when outside and over six feet away from others is uncalled for and unconstitutiona
l. For a higher learning institution y’all sure don’t seem to be using any of the knowledge and common sense. As a parent of a student and probable future student I am concerned.",Students need to ask for help and work harder it is out their for them times are hard,Unbelievable. The campus leadership has lost their minds. Students are not going to return next year. Way to go UA!!,My son has no in person classes this semester. As of the day we dropped him off he had 4/6 in person and it was changed the day before class started. I am very disappointed in this decision.,Yea and I’m willing to bet When students get spring break back NEXT YEAR we SOME of FACULTY STAFF WONT!!!! 😡 but we will get our SHORT WINTER BREAK BACK!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The most recent message to our students from Dr. Pope::: VP for Student Life ↓

Our numbers for testing continue to improve and I remain grateful for your vigilant attention to campus policies helping us curb the spread of COVID-19. It is imperative we all continue to follow our UA Health and Safety Guidelines as we strive to complete a safe fall semester: http://bit.ly/HealthSafetyGuidelines

The moratorium on in-person gatherings remains in effect. However::: because of your commitment to halting the spread of COVID-19::: I am pleased to share the following changes::: effective Monday::: Sept. 14:

-Campus study spaces in residential areas are eligible to be opened.
-Dining rooms will be opened with strict adherence to safety guidelines.
-Colleges and departments can begin to host in-person events that follow the previous limitations for a maximum of 50 people inside and 100 people outside. Events must be submitted for approval through the appropriate VP or dean’s office.
-Students who live in the same residence hall may visit each other’s rooms::: provided: (1) masks are worn; (2) social distancing is strictly observed; and (3) each resident is limited to one guest at a time.

Social distancing::: mask wearing::: and other health and safety protocols must be strictly observed in all of these environments. Student-organized gatherings and events remain prohibited at this time.

The gradual loosening of moratorium restrictions will continue to be evaluated as we move forward. With your continued cooperation::: and as our numbers for testing and student conduct cases continue to improve::: we will consider longer-term plans for the semester. We must stay the course and continue to follow the health and safety protocols set forth in the Return to Full Operations Plan.

We have listened and responded to your concerns about evolving our policies to create the healthiest learning environment possible. I hope the changes outlined above demonstrate our continued commitment to your academic success and creating a more engaged and safe campus for all.

Thank you again as we all do our part to stay Tide Together.

Let them go to school.,Nice work Dr. Bell.....Cash those tuition checks first!! Well played! (No relation::: by the way),I don’t understand all the hostility around testing. Everyone is turning this into a political discussion or point of view. It should be about limiting the spread of the virus. If testing does that::: I’m fine with it.,Just here for the free medical advice,Such hostility. Why are we talking about the media? Why do you think the University doesn’t have the students & universities best interests at heart? And yes::: we want to have football.,Has there ever been another ‘pandemic’ that we counted number of cases too?

Can they get in without a mask?,Ok... so my kid could be turned away from a shelter because in a panic-filled moment he left his mask? AND.... if he is currently quarantined he is to go sit in his VEHICLE in a parking garage? Are we in the Twilight Zone.... so COVID law takes precedence over the immediate life threatening danger of a tornado? Please tell me I'm not reading this right.... I really pray that I'm mistaken!,Please compare deaths from the tornado that hit Tuscaloosa and the number of deaths of college age students in Tuscaloosa from COVID-19 when you are making these “rules”. Please quit teaching our students to live in fear of COVID-19.,Here’s the real rule... in the event of tornado::: get to a shelter. If you have Covid::: pull your T-shirt collar up over your mouth and nose if you have to be closer than 6’.,I curious who was responsible for posting this. First of all the information is dated August 27::: when remnants of hurricane Laura were a possible threat to Tuscaloosa. Why is this being posted 12 days later. Second::: this is a ridiculous plan! All students and faculty should be advised to shelter in the closest storm shelter! I would much rather my child be in a shelter with a covid positive student than driving around looking for the “appropriate” shelter. Please re-visit this plan!,I can just see big trouble coming this is so Ridiculous,For being an institution of higher learning::: that’s some creative sentence structure at the beginning.,James Spann,Katelyn Ashton Dunavant,Oh my!,"Good grief people::: this has been the plan for quite some time. The exception of Covid related protocols is the only addition. The parking deck is a completely secure structure. As for the timelines of the information::: UA posts these reminders from time to time as the chance for severe weather in Tuscaloosa during the late summer and spring is elevated.

Get a grip.",This is truly a new level of absurdity. Common sense is dead at UA,I’m pretty sure social distancing and mask wearing shouldn’t be a priority or even a consideration when it comes to getting to a safe place during a tornado. Please stay in your car until a warning is issued? This is maybe the most ridiculous thing I’ve heard in an ocean of ridiculousness!,I hope the students are more educated then most of these people on here with their comments/ questions. For Gods sake::: if weather is to the point where you need to take shelter::: go to a shelter. If you don’t have a mask::: they’re not going to turn you away. 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️,Which is more likely to kill a student - Covid or a Tornado?! I’m going with tornado,It’s a tornado. Forget the mask and get in the shelter. Remember 2011? Roll Tide.,Oh it wouldn’t be another day in 2020 without the bellyaching and whining over masks. Give it a rest already. It’s pathetic.,Nadia Anastasia watching these parents lose their minds feeds my soul. Obviously they will have spare masks.

Many kids are not doing well right now (mentally) and the idea of being pulled out of their dorm (with no symptoms or light ones) is adding to their anxiety. That’s the problem. I wish it were treated like a household where the positive case was confined to their room and food delivered to their door::: masked using the bathroom::: whatever.

Nope- people go to UA to learn fact-based education. Science is fact-based. Science says test often to help control spread. WHy would you not want to test? Politics and watching too much Fox,I find all these comments both comical and concerning at the same time. Too many people take a stand on this due to political views. We are all better than to let political parties influence our opinions on the health of our kids::: their friends::: parents and others.

"A message from President Bell regarding the upcoming holiday weekend ↓

Dear students::: faculty and staff:::

Wherever you spend the holiday::: remember to:

- Wear your mask.
- Practice social distancing.
- Avoid large gatherings.
- Complete isolation or quarantine::: if applicable.

Our robust testing::: isolation and quarantine protocols make it possible for us to contain the coronavirus and keep us together this fall. To accomplish our goals::: it is imperative that all of us do our part::: in all settings on and off campus. Violations of our Health and Safety directives will continue to be investigated and appropriate actions will follow.

Our COVID hotline will remain open 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. throughout the weekend::: so please call 205-348-CV19 if you have questions or health concerns. Our Healthinfo website is continually updated with the latest information and is an excellent resource: healthinfo.ua.edu

Your continued commitment is the key to unlock the Alabama experience this fall and beyond. I hope you have a safe holiday weekend!

"The latest from President Bell to our students::: faculty + staff:

As we accelerate education and enforcement efforts on and off campus::: we look to each of you to do your part.

Those who fail to abide by the Health and Safety protocols face serious consequences. To date::: we have issued more than 400 conduct referrals for COVID-related violations. Interim measures removing individuals from campus have been imposed in several of these cases. Those who blatantly disregard the rules will not be given the option of jeopardizing the semester for everyone else.

In addition to wearing your mask and practicing social distancing::: it is imperative that you comply with all aspects of our testing and isolation or quarantine protocols. Students with COVID symptoms should seek testing through the Student Health Center or the University Medical Center testing site at Coleman Coliseum: https://healthinfo.ua.edu/testing-information/

If you choose to test off campus::: you are required to share positive results with the CV19 Support Program immediately by calling 205-348-CV19. Anyone who fails to disclose a positive test or violates the University’s isolation or quarantine protocols is subject to severe disciplinary action: https://www.ua.edu/news/2020/08/what-to-know-about-isolation-quarantine-protocols/

I hope you understand where your salary comes from. This is a free country. Keep adding threats and restrictions and you want have enough students to cover expenses.,Paul A. Hill,"Comrade Bell please read the CDC release that says this was all a farce.
Stop your gestapo tactics and let the kids enjoy college life

If you fail to realize this .. You should immediately resign in shame and utter disgrace.",Better then sick or dead kids good for him he is trying to protect students and faculty wake up,Thanks for trying to keep the students::: faculty::: staff and community members safe.,Thank you. Many of us appreciate your efforts.,This is a difficult situation for everyone. I don’t like the cavalier nature of the threats especially with regard to reporting test results::: especially when HIPAA is so highly regulated and the school has not disclosed how they are protecting data and to whom the data is being disclosed. Give the hurry up nature of the tracking system I would like to understand what 3rd party audits and certifications were completed on the tools in use and what training and background checks have been instituted for those supporting the tools and acting as case managers with access to healthcare data.,Sorry for all the students and staff praying for all.,"College sounds real fun. I'd hate to be taking on student loan debt to be treated like it's the Soviet gulag.

And the CDC just came out with the data showing 94% of Covid related deaths had underlying medical issues. In other words::: otherwise healthy people have an extremely::: extremely low mortality rate if they even get it.

If they aren't listening to the CDC info when making policy::: just who are they listening to?",Many people & students have “morbidities” - asthma::: hypertension & ones so minor that they don’t even know about. So we shouldn’t protect them? Is wearing a mask & social distancing so hard? Who do you want to teach the classes if the instructors get Covid?,"How can Dr Bell threaten students with suspension and sanction the football team a peaceful march during their imposed 2 week ""lockdown"" what's the message here?",Yawn 🥱,Yet the players didn't social distance in their march. WHY????,"So a protest with clearly more than 10 people will be ignored::: right? But if I have a 'protest' at my house with more than 10 people::: my daughter can't attend or be under threat of being punished by the University? Oh::: it's because they are protesting social injustice so the #ChineseWuhanVir
us won't bother them. SMDH",Roll Tide,"As of July 21 there have been ZERO deaths in Alabama of people under 29 years old!!! To my knowledge there have also been no hospitalization
s at DCH. The University and the city should relax restrictions - not ramp them up. If a student has underlying medical conditions or obesity then they should of course have the option of taking the classes on line.",Britt Ryan,"My wife and I are both alum my older two children are alum and my youngest just started. What am I paying out of state tuition for? I sent a letter to the regents with no reply.
My daughter can’t go to the sorority house or class or go to a resteraunt or any gathering. She is taking classes on line on her computer not socializing with others all day. Why not just go to Phoenix University.
Refund 50-70 percent of our tuition. Simple. Your cowering to the hype and our children are suffering so Dr Bell can get along with the liberal mob",Honestly I need some options for recourse! This is insane that the athletes could march today and our kids are basically locked in their dorms and houses,MIchelle Johnson,Did the BLM march require masks? You students complaining are not the only ones required to wear masks. Get over it. I don't like it either::: but i don't want the virus. Grow up. Sometimes we have to do things we don't like!,So how many students are showing ANY symptoms? The million dollar question.,Thank you for keeping our kids safe!!!!,Thank you Bama for being first rate & trying to keep everyone safe !,Erik Kopp,Continued threats and shaming is not a public health strategy.,I’m not hearing of anything being taken serious. I sure hope you guys are. I love my alumni and I hope they take it serious. I’ve had Covid and lost my dad and two other family members to Covid. It’s not a joke.

Seems like the virus is less intense than in March when it was horrific. They will climb::: shut down and numbers fall::: to flatten the curve...then move on with life...with masks...
by the way::: the numbers should be updated daily not weekly. A week is wayyyyy too long....they will get the numbers all mixed up by then. They should report numbers of cumulative cases and in the last 24 hours.

So the kids tested negative 2 weeks ago felt safe seeing friends from last March they all thought they had a false sense of security and now are testing positive....",It does not matter when or where.

He then said the spread could get into our most vulnerable population thereby over running our health system. Why in the hell::: can we not tell the most vulnerable to take extra precautions as they see fit::: and allow the rest of us to live our lives normally? Do we really think these college kids are hanging out with Grandma and Grandpa? And for those college kids with underlying health problems they should be taking class online.

They all received an email and uprooting them a week into school after they shared teary goodbyes with their moms and dads::: they get their whole room (new home) together::: making friends::: etc...and moving them somewhere else that is FULL capacity. Maybe or maybe not will have the same Roomate. Why? To save the university money!

Basically we are paying for residency for them to self quarantine and have all online classes and to-go meals. What did they think students that had a crappy senior year and independent for first time were going to do?!! But it wasn’t like we could tell our kid they can’t move in if university is saying it’s open for business and gets them excited! Criminal and negligent on their part if you ask me.",As a U of A student parent::: I want to thank you for publishing this very informative dashboard.

"Today: Tuscaloosa Mayor Walt Maddox released an executive order to help ensure the health and safety of our UA + Tuscaloosa communities.

The order includes:
-Closing of bars effective for the next 14 days (Aug. 24-Sept. 8)::: starting at 5pm tonight.

-Elimination of bar service at restaurants::: for the next 14 days (Aug. 24-Sept. 8)::: starting at 5pm tonight. Only table service is allowed.

-Request of the Alabama Beverage Control Board that all of Tuscaloosa County be placed under a prohibition of sales of alcohol::: on-premises consumption at bars from Aug.24-Sept.8.

""The goal of all of these protocols is to keep our students on campus::: and allow our classes to be delivered in that way::: and by doing that we're able to flatten this curve and move forward in our semester. This is a very dynamic situation. We value our students' health::: their ability to get the most out of their Tuscaloosa and Alabama experience."" - President Bell

A new poll reveals Americans have a wildly overstated view of COVID-19's impact with respect to total infections and total deaths as percentage of the population.

Poll Question: How many people in your country have had COVID-19?
Americans Answered: 20% (66M)
Reality: 1% (3.3M)

Poll Question: How many people in your country have died from COVID-19?
Americans Answered: 9% (29.5M)
Reality: 0.04% (131K)

Americans overstated the death number by 225 times.

People in France::: Sweden::: and the UK all overstated the same number by 100 times. People in Denmark were off by 300 times.

These perceptions impact consumer behavior::: voter sentiment::: and policy prescriptions with large economic costs like prolonged lockdowns and stay at home orders.

We have deployed every resource at our disposal to provide comprehensive testing::: contact tracing protocol::: education and training programs. We have redesigned and equipped our infrastructure to ensure that our classrooms::: dining facilities::: residence halls and other places on campus are as safe as they can be for students::: faculty and staff.

Thank you to our students::: parents and families who have entrusted us to provide a safe environment for them to continue to learn and to grow. By returning to the Capstone this fall::: they have demonstrated the incredible value that they place on the Alabama experience. I want them to know how much we appreciate them::: how hard we are working to keep the Alabama experience that they cherish intact.

"The most recent message from President Bell ↓

Dear students::: faculty and staff:::
This is a critical moment for The University of Alabama.

Despite the robust testing::: training::: health and safety measures we carefully and clearly implemented::: there is an unacceptable rise in positive COVID cases on our campus.

Make no mistake::: this trend is a real threat to our ability to complete the semester on campus. The solution is proven: testing::: mask wearing::: social distancing::: personal hygiene and compliance with crowd size limits are all that are asked as we work together to complete the semester together.

Violations to our health and safety protocols::: both on and off campus::: are subject to harsh disciplinary action::: up to and including suspension from UA.

UAPD and the Tuscaloosa Police Department are partnering to monitor bars::: restaurants and off-campus residences where the city’s COVID-19 ordinances and UA guidelines are not being followed. Joint task force officers are risking their personal health and safety to protect yours. UAPD officers are also focusing efforts on our residence halls and Greek housing to ensure safety and compliance.

Completing the fall semester together is our goal. The margin for error is shrinking.

Now is the time to take action::: commit to protect each other::: and hold each other accountable. Thank you for taking your responsibilities seriously. Together::: through shared sacrifice and commitment::: we will achieve our goal.

Tide Together:::

I encourage you to do the same. Squeaky wheel gets the grease::: right? Apparently::: we aren't being squeaky enough. Encourage your students to do the same. It can't hurt. My kid was very upset yesterday::: so I told his story out of concern. I believe at least one student will buckle under this system before COVID-19 takes any student lives. I've had too many friends who have lost children to suicide and I think this situation is the perfect storm to tip a kid toward giving up. Here's my letter titled Which Comes First: The COVID-19 Chicken or The Suicide Egg.

Dear President Bell:::

I you beg you to consider the thought that suicides will be the leading cause of any UA student deaths in the 20-21 academic year::: not COVID-19. I understand you are pressured by some folks who believe it is in the best interest of the student body to learn online to try to evade contracting COVID-19::: but please read my story. Today::: my normally confident and level-headed son who is a freshman engineering student called me and was quite upset. He didn't call because he was ill from a COVID-19 infection. He called because he was feeling sick to his stomach anxious over the fear of failing. To be completely clear::: this was compounded with a poor night's sleep after a break up with his girlfriend. I said to myself::: okay::: this is just one of those calls I'm going to get because he's a Type A freshman who hasn't faced much adversity in his life. I asked him why he was so bent out of shape over school::: knowing the break up was probably the majority of his issue. He said::: ""Mom::: I wouldn't be afraid of failing my classes if i could go in person. I'm afraid I am not going to succeed with online learning. I'm unsure if I am getting all the course related emails. The book store ran out of chemistry lab books before could buy one and I have a lab this week. I didn't get my e-codes for some of my text books until literally hours before classes began. I am juggling when to be online and when I go in person."" Despite being a very smart kid::: he's like every other freshman trying to figure out college and very worried knowing if he's on top of everything. He's also one of the many students who will go through a relationship break up. I know if he's feeling this way::: it's just as overwhelming for other students. As a matter fact::: I have read several similar struggles and worries shared on the parent Facebook page . It's one thing to end an academic year online::: but a much more frustrating situation to begin your freshman year online. I know it could be much worse. Past generations faced sending sons and daughters overseas to fight world wars. Thank God::: this is nothing like that. That's exactly why I ask you to fight for these kids to be able to attend in person. It's nothing as serious as a world war::: but it as serious as a suicide by one of the thousands of fragile::: inexperienced scared teens who are in your care. They really aren't that vulnerable to COVID-19::: but are extremely vulnerable crumble under the pressure to succeed. Please don't be the COVID-19 chicken incubating student suicide eggs.

The administration set up the students to fail. Today’s email is just the necessary window dressing to make sure the president and BoT can blame the students when they go to remote learning.

They’ll blame the students when they have to lay people off.

They’ll blame the students when department budgets are slashed.

They’ll blame the students when departments are closed.

They won’t blame the systems that put them in this corner. They won’t blame the bloating of administrative positions and the shrinking of public funds. They won’t admit that the mode of higher education they helped build and bought into and made them money also causes the cracks that COVID has burst open.

I want to suggest that if you want kids to NOT congregate and stay isolated you have to do a better job with the dining halls.

"An important message from Dr. Bell regarding safety + well-being of our campus community ↓

Dear students::: faculty and staff:::

The University recently shared with all of you the policies and directives that underpin our plan to return to operations this semester.

The expected rules and behaviors of all students and student organizations have been clearly defined. While we are appreciative to those who have taken these expectations seriously::: I am deeply disappointed that those guidelines are not being followed by each and every member of our student body.

This afternoon the Division of Student Life will announce additional directives that are focused solely on the safety and well-being of our campus community. That information also will be shared with the parents and families of our students.

Tide Together now more than ever::: we are seeing the harsh consequences at other universities which have been forced to close abruptly because safety protocols were not followed. The eyes of the nation are following us closely and I am confident we will meet and exceed our status as frontrunners.

Despite the challenges::: we can measure success by many benchmarks.

Our student re-entry testing is nearly complete and the positive rate is around 1%::: far below national averages. Results will be posted at www.uasystem.edu beginning Monday afternoon on the new System-wide data dashboard and will be updated as we move into sentinel testing.

More than 20 employees have been assigned to focus solely on exposure notifications::: isolation::: quarantining and sanitization protocols. More than 450 beds have been dedicated for isolation purposes. Although more than 90% of those beds are vacant::: we will expand those resources as needed.

Hundreds of hours have been invested by our Situational Response Team and the President’s Advisory Committee to develop and implement guidelines that are consistent with the UA System Task Force Comprehensive Health and Safety Plan. Their work continues 24/7.

As an institution::: we are 45:::000 strong::: representing every county in Alabama::: every state in the nation::: and most countries around the world. It is a privilege to lead you.

Please know that I am counting on each of you not only to do your part to keep our campus safe::: but to report any activities that you believe might compromise the overall health and safety of our University community. Reports can be made online or by calling 1-866-362-9476.

I look forward to your comments and suggestions::: which we urge you to share at president@ua.edu.

Thank you:::

Stuart R. Bell

Shut up and pay tribute to big al.😋🤗😂,Chelsey Morris,Every Covid infected individual I know have contracted wearing mask. This is gone too far. No medical randomized studies done proving mask. Ridiculous statement to say if individuals don’t follow a mask rule should be kicked out. My student is deserving of her paid by me education just as any other.

Thank you to whoever wrote this. I copied this and changed it a little.

What is the end game with the ‘rona? Anyone? 🦠

What is the magic formula that is going to allow us to sound the “all clear?” Is it zero cases? For a while::: the goal was to simply “flatten the curve:::” but now that we are disconnecting utilities for gatherings in California::: setting up check points in New York::: and recommending goggles (what’s next?)::: it seems as if there is::: in fact::: no end game. And::: truthfully::: the only way that we will see numbers drop is if we cease testing and stop reporting. Keep in mind that hundreds of thousands have shown up to be tested::: registered::: left due to long waits::: and still come up positive when they received their results. 🤷🏼‍♀️

Is it a vaccine💉? It took 25 years for a chicken pox vaccine to be developed. The smallpox inoculation was discovered in 1776 and the last known natural case was in 1977. We have a flu vaccine that is only 40 to 60% effective (that’s generous- the last two years it was more like 20-25%)::: less than half of the US population chooses to get one::: and roughly 20:::000 Americans still die annually due to flu or flu complications.

Oh::: you'll mandate it in order to attend school::: travel to some foreign countries::: etc.? We already have a growing number of vaccine researchers refusing proven::: tested::: well-known vaccines that have been administered for decades! Do you really believe the majority of people will flock to get a fast-tracked vaccine::: whose long-term side effects and overall efficacy rates are anyone's best guess? How long are we going to cancel? Postpone? Reconsider?

Now we are advised against in-person school until second quarter? What if October's numbers are the same as August's? Then what?

Move football to spring? What if next March is worse than this March?

When do we decide quality of life outweighs risk?

We understand this virus can be deadly for SOME::: but so are shellfish::: peanut butter::: and bee stings. We take risks every day without a second thought.

We know driving a car can be dangerous::: but we don't leave it parked in the garage for months on end. We know the dangers of smoking::: drinking::: and eating fried foods::: but we do it::: none-the-less. We speed on highways::: some idiots still don't buckle their seatbelts::: we take medications more than “as directed:::” and a good number of individuals don't think twice about unprotected sex.

Is hugging Grandma really more dangerous than rush hour on the freeway? Is going to a bar with friends more risky than four day old gas station sushi? Or operating a chainsaw?

When and how did we so quickly lose our free will?

I want a waiver that says::: ""I understand the risks::: but I choose a life with hugs::: smiles::: college athletics::: the state fair::: concerts::: and school dances.""

I understand that there is a minuscule possibility I could die but::: more probable::: I will end up feeling like junk for a few days.

I understand I could possibly pass this virus onto someone else::: but I can pass ANY virus onto someone else at any time until the end of time.

RTR!,"I am confident as a parent that many kids are doing the right thing. If a few kids can’t do without partying for a few more months than shame on them. I know tons of students from reading many comments that are looking to socialize and meet new people. So yes I agree::: the Greek life is a majority of the gatherings. I saw it all last weekend as we moved my son into campus Saturday. And the bars on University drive we’re open amd very active.
Hope we can stay open the whole year!!! 🙏🙏 ROLL TIDE 🐘🅰️","I’m happy they are able to be there however perhaps if they lightened up especially on the dining together the kids would stay on campus lessening the risk off campus

This is worse than prison.,It is very unclear what a gathering is ? Are kids supposed to be locked in their room ?,How many parents or students would be willing to sign a waiver releasing the University of Alabama from all Covid related liability?,They have many flaws in their demands. For instance student has zoom online class immediately followed by in person class. Student lives off campus. This week she had to do zoom class at sorority house then walk to in person. Now with the new prison rules she can’t go to sorority house or any other communal place on campus to attend online class then walk to in person class. She has 15 minutes. She lives off campus. It is impossible. Not to mention the fact that we are all paying an arm and a leg for classes::: housing and clubs and not getting what we are paying for. Absurd. I LOVE the university of Alabama but they have made horrible decisions all the way back to the Spring concerning COVID.,So you have effectively put my child::: as well as thousands of others::: under house arrest. Under what statute do you derive that authority?,You should be smart and close down the school like all the other universities are doing! SCU::: Chapel Hill as well as many others. Your putting students at risk just to make money and keep enrollment steady which is ridiculous! Add in the cost of housing::: tuition::: parents having to move their kid in and the risk factors it posed::: especially to those students who live out of state. If you’re going to put these strict restrictions in place::: I hope you’re also going to be reimbursing most tuition and housing fees! Closing the school is the best thing to do but sadly it will be an added costs and health risks for parents and kids to now spend the money to move their kids back out. Safety should have been your first priority from the start! Did you not think the numbers would spike? Come on....,"Can the football team still gather...asking
for a friend? $$$",I'm happy to give up the two weeks if it means classes can continue. I'm thankful the University is doing everything it can to keep the University open. Even though she only has a couple of in person classes it makes a huge difference to her. My daughter is happiest down there. I give the University a lot of credit for trying to give the kids the college experience during this time.

Just be grateful our kids can return to school and if you think they are all going to act perfectly::: it’s not going to happen. And kudos to the sororities (and everyone at UA) for doing their best to make the most of what they had to deal with. I mean really. It’s so easy to sit back and criticize what everyone else is doing. I can guarantee you that more kids got sick last year after rush than this year. But this year::: we will make a bigger deal about it. 🤔. If you were that worried::: keep your kids home for the semester. We all knew by sending our kids back::: it would be a risk. We take risks everyday.

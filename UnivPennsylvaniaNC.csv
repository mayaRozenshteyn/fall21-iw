What's behind the rise in prices? | Penn Today",2021-09-21 15:45:02,an overwhelming resistance from a sub-group within the United States to prioritize the needs of humanity over the greed is what serves as a pillar to the inflation. the other nice words are just that. It does not take a Wharton finance professor to articulate what is clear at the spiritual and moral levels. However::: we thank the behavioral scientist for illuminating a point for the stiff-necked in ways that they can process.,"How would you describe inflation in food and energy?

The Professor's response: You saw it in some types of food::: but not all. And again::: and I think that when you saw it::: you can use the same kind of framework of supply and demand to explain it. With food::: it‚Äôs not like you had pent-up demand::: which is clearly something that you had with cars and with flying::: for example::: airfare. For these::: you had pent-up demand. People did not consume so much of it::: and then they wanted to do it and then supply didn‚Äôt catch up::: so you see prices going up. I think with food::: it‚Äôs not like all of a sudden demand was spiking. A lot of it::: if you did see price increases::: would be coming from supply disruptions. And the supply disruptions are really across the board. And a lot of it is related to the pandemic. Commentary: (Federal-level Economic Research spoke to the differentiated spike in food prices::: which show further that the organic fresh produce witnessed a short-term dip in price valuation in no small part because 1) the free food being delivered to the poor was largely dairy subsidized by the same system that is keeping the dairy::: corn::: and soy industries afloat::: 2) people in the U.S. display a propensity to consume less healthy food::: 3) abysmal treatment of immigrants who in the Southern and Western region of the country (the regions producing the overwhelming majority of U.S. grown food) was used as a deflective point in national politics that still show a preponderantly predominate predisposition to prioritize the ideologies of a statistical minority within whom there are members with a monetary advantage over the statistical majority.) So::: YES a lot of it was related to CVD. Fewer U.S. nationals and residents want to do manual labor::: but people still want to eat and to travel. So::: LOGICALLY::: there will be an increase in price when demands haven't really changed::: but the structures in place to provide for people's convenience get disrupted.",Thanks Joe Biden,Biden,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overcoming | Penn Abroad",2021-07-04 15:00:16,"HOW TO OVERCOME VOTER SUPPRESSION
On this July 4th::: a day symbolic of democratic ideals::: I‚Äôd like to suggest the best way to overcome voter suppression. It‚Äôs so simple that it‚Äôs odd it hasn‚Äôt been widely discussed. Just make Election Day a DE FACTO holiday::: no need for an act of Congress. This can be done in several ways: by the will of the people and the support of state and local government::: labor unions::: big business::: and most employers::: and by Executive action by President Biden.
Most people who don‚Äôt vote in person are just worried about losing a day‚Äôs pay or don‚Äôt have time to wait on a long line after work. State and local governments can declare local holidays or closings for election day or give their employees the day off. President Biden::: as chief executive::: should declare a holiday for Federal workers and contractors::: or even invoke executive action as an emergency power. Big corporations such as Walmart and Amazon should give workers the day off. Labor unions should make it an issue in their contracts. School boards should close schools for the day. The list goes on::: and I‚Äôm not an expert::: but an average person can probably add a few options to this list. As for the cost to employers for another paid holiday or to employees for an unpaid day off::: that is a silly issue altogether. There are so many variations in hours per day::: personal or vacation days::: compensatory time::: etc.::: that would
make the problem of cost not relevant or at least not material as the price of saving democracy.

"Hatred Has No Place at Penn

A Message from
Amy Gutmann::: President
Wendell Pritchett::: Provost
Craig Carnaroli::: Executive Vice President
J. Larry Jameson::: Dean::: Perelman School of Medicine and
Executive Vice President University of Pennsylvania for the Health System

Our country has recently witnessed a deeply disturbing increase in anti-Semitism and instances of prejudice and bigotry directed toward people of Asian or African descent and other diverse groups. This is wholly unacceptable anywhere. It is all the more unconscionable in a free and educated nation that anyone should fear for their safety or be forced to endure the vile rantings and sickening symbols of bigotry. Read more below.

Behind the Ivy covered walls
Of the sacred learning halls.
Here the spirit can be found

We will be cheering this then

"The single most important measure each of us can take to protect ourselves along with those on campus and in our surrounding communities is to get vaccinated against COVID-19. With well-grounded confidence in the safety::: effectiveness::: and broad availability of COVID-19 vaccines::: we previously announced that all students are required to be vaccinated for the fall semester with exemptions provided only for medical and religious reasons.

Today we are announcing that all current faculty::: staff::: and postdoctoral trainees are required to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 no later than August 1::: 2021. Employees of Penn‚Äôs health schools must follow any additional school-specific guidelines.

The full statement and more information on obtaining a vaccine appointment are at the link below.

A message to faculty::: staff::: and postdocs on vaccination status and return to campus | Penn Today",2021-06-01 16:07:42,And let the flood of people unaffiliated with Penn drop in to spout their nonsense üçø,Finally! Other schools have already come out and said ‚Äúthis Fall all will be in-person::: vaccinations are required and there will be no special employee accommodations for those not wanting to be in-person‚Äù.,"Implementation of policies like this one::: egregiously violates the medical privacy of everyone involved and is clearly discriminatory to all those who want to wait until the COVID vaccines receive FULL FDA approval before being immunized or for whatever their private reason may be. They are experimental only.

The medical privacy of every Pennsylvanian/
American must be protected::: and our legislators have a sacred obligation you to protect the privacy and dignity of their constituents.",as far is penns is concend:::we must all vacinated conected in conected penns university,"""my body::: my choice"" may be true but since the University is a private employer::: ""my body::: my choice"" may mean it's no longer ""my job"".",My body::: my choice. Please don‚Äôt force your staff to get vaccinated against their will.,Wrong decision! Discrimination.,Incoming internet scientists seeking to correct one of the top research schools in the county,Wow ü•∫,Why religious?,Oh my really..?,ITS ABOUT DAMN TIME,The University of Pennsylvania is a waste of money if you are looking for an education. Go to a community or state college. It‚Äôs a much better investment.,This is against the law. Title III of the civil rights act prohibits discrimination based on medical condition in both public and private facilities. Do we even need to address morality? UPenn can revisit the 4th Amendment and a few hundred years worth of case law surrounding it as well. What little Hitler made this decision::: do tell?,"Why are these universities ignoring the latest science and not acknowledging natural Covid antibody immunity? Long-term immunity has been validated in the bone marrow of recovered Covid patients! Young healthy students do not need a vaccine! Also there are people who are naturally immune from the virus. Enforcing a non-FDA approved drug on society with no long-term data is unethical! The FDA is there to protect us! Until they approve and label it a vaccine we are still in clinical trials.

Per the Red Cross::: vaccinated individuals cannot donate plasma to help people recover from Covid. The vaccination only provides Spike protein protection and does not provide both Spike and Nucleocapsid protein protection like natural immunity! THIS IS FACT! If you doubt me then why aren‚Äôt C antibody tests used to validate whether the vaccine worked? Because the C antibody tests look for the Nucleocapsid protein. Hence vaccinated people do not stop the spread as it only protects the individual by blocking the Spike protein.

This response from the University is what happens when they get in bed with the government and support corporate greed.","Communists are among us.

"Due to COVID-19 public health limitations::: the in-person 265th Commencement ceremony on Monday::: 5/17::: is only open to graduating seniors. Family::: friends::: & the community at large are invited to tune in to a live webcast online::: which will begin at 9 a.m.

PENNTODAY.UPENN.EDU
Celebrating Penn‚Äôs 265th Commencement | Penn Today",2021-05-11 14:15:02,Is there any way that there can be formal communication to all of the graduate and professional students as to WHY we cannot have in person ceremonies? Our schools have many less students each than the entire undergraduate student body::: so why have we not been given any reasoning to this decision since March when it was announced?,"I dont understand why they won't let parents go to an in person graduation.

Yet 2 months from now I can go to a packed Lincoln Financial stadium for a Motley Crue concert. SMH",Penn has 3x more students than Princeton (Penn has almost 26k students while Princeton has 8k students). The headcount adds up quickly for graduation.,This is quite ridiculous and disappointing. Syracuse is managing to have in person graduation at the carrier dome - which is inside. Certainly Penn could find a way to allow graduates two tickets to Franklin Field - even if it means holding 2 ceremonies!,How long did it take them to cancel classes for the Eagles parade? Drexel made the call before they did.,"So disappointed at Penn; they took the easy way out and let their students ( and parents) down once again.... my daughter being one of them. Congratulations
to all the graduating seniors.",What about class of 2020? Will they ever get to celebrate their achievements? Or maybe it doesn‚Äôt matter anymore since they don‚Äôt pay tuition!,"Reading ‚ÄúThe Amateur Hour‚Äù by University of Pennsylvania Professor Jonathan Zimmerman reminds the reader of the advice Neal Page gave Del Griffith in ‚ÄúPlanes::: Trains and Automobiles.‚Äùü§Æüí©
üí©‚ÄúHere‚Äôs a good idea: have a point:::‚Äù Page tells Griffith::: after being bored to death by a number of his stories. ‚ÄúIt makes it so much more interesting for the listener!‚Äù","Great example of the laziness of the Penn admin. Princeton graduation allows guests in a stadium 1/4 the size of franklin field. In a time ripe for innovation. Two schools 45 miles apart. Same student/family demographics. Which school showed who cared about their students? One final example of how Penn fails to address student life issues. My parting message to freshman parents/
students is not to accept the lack of support for student life at penn (Substandard food/living conditions/
lack of activities/
negative support for sports or other organization/
tone-deaf to student wants....) Penns mental health struggles over the past 8 years are rooted in Penns admin lack of focus on student life. Penn is a great academic school::: it has a great student body. The administration counts on you feeling ""lucky"" to be here as a cover for this shortfall. Don't accept it..... it can be much better for you and your kids. There are some who will respond how great it was::: just be aware there are many who think how great it could have been.",In light of CDC new guidance::: how about changing the graduation plans to allow family to attend?,Let‚Äôs not forget about the Class of 2020.. they deserve their celebration too,Penn is in the city of Philadelphia. Philadelphia does not follow normal PA rules. Philadelphia rules make the decision.,"Congratulations
UPenn class of 2021!",Step up PENN! I feel terrible for these students and family should be able to attend. Disappointing,"Congratulations
to University of Pennsylvania class of 2021 üéì::: especially to Stefano Yushinskiüë®‚Äçüéì::: proud Mama. ‚ô•Ô∏è",Chris Tremoglie,"The best and brightest and the most educated have acted ridiculously and failed their students.

Sporting events allow THOUSANDS in their stadiums in Philadelphia however the so-called best and brightest couldn‚Äôt figure out a way to hold a graduation.

This is what causes the unnecessary divide in this country over the pandemic. Power hungry::: authoritative left wingers have overreacted and overreached to impose stupid::: foolish::: and unnecessarily actions like this.

Citizens Bank Park is about 4 miles away and can have 11:::000 in attendance. Outdoor arenas across the commonwealth are now permitted to allow 50% of capacity. Shame on Penn",Thanks for updating,Pao Caceres,"https://

from Amy Gutmann::: President and Wendell Pritchett::: Provost

We were profoundly disturbed to learn this past week that human remains::: provided to a faculty member by the medical examiner many decades ago in an effort to identify a victim from the 1985 bombing of the MOVE house::: had been kept at the Penn Museum for much of that time. Simply said::: this was insensitive::: unprofessional and unacceptable.

An official apology has been extended to the Africa family by the Museum and the University::: and the Museum is currently working to return the remains to the family. In our judgment::: it is imperative that we bring in an outside investigator who can examine how this unfolded and provide us with a complete report on what transpired. To this end::: we have hired attorneys Joe Tucker and Carl Singley of the Tucker Law Group to investigate how the remains came into the possession of the Museum and what transpired with them for nearly four decades. We will share this report with the community and use its findings to help us ensure that nothing of this nature is repeated in the future.

A message to the Penn community regarding Commencement | Penn Today",2021-03-09 20:16:07,Sadly::: Penn does not value its seniors who chose remote studies. No inclusiveness here! All graduating seniors should have been invited to participate with those studying remotely being given the option to return to Philadlephia with the guideline of quarantining prior to the ceremony and testing. Many may have already received the vaccine by graduation.,Just out of curiosity::: are there plans for class of 2020 having an in person commencement (as promised last year)? I get that this is stressed as ‚Äúlimited‚Äù::: but surely the vast majority of people moved away so attendance by class of 2020 would be limited anyway.,Very disappointing to hear that Penn is not including their hard working graduate students!! All students deserve to be celebrated! This is not what you would expect from a prestigious University!,No one does graduation like UPENN. Incredible.

A different choice by 5:::229 voters in Arizona (11 electors)::: 5:::890 in Georgia (16)::: and 10:::342 in Wisconsin (10) would have defeated Biden -\-\ despite Biden's nationwide lead of more than 7 million. The Electoral College would have tied 269-269. Congress would have decided the election::: regardless of the popular vote in any state or throughout the country.

Each of these 21:::461 voters was 329 times more important than the more than 7 million.

It‚Äôs because of current state-by-state statewide winner-take-all

In 2016::: Trump became President even though Clinton won the national popular vote by 2:::868:::518 votes.

New Commitment Will Drive Energy Solutions | Power of Penn Stories",2020-12-30 14:00:18,"I think Penn and other institutions concerned about energy and environmental consequences of ways of producing energy should do more to decrease their consumption of energy. For example::: I have seen the multiple outdoor electric heat lamps in front of the main entrance of HUP all running full blast while the outdoor temperature was in the 60s. There is a similarly power-hungry bunch of these heat lamps at the main entrance of the Perelman Center for Advanced Medicine. The Inn at Penn hotel also has electric outdoor heat lamps. I think that the percentage of these heat lamps being on should be cut back as outdoor temperature increases past some point::: and at least most of them should be off when the outdoor temperature is in the 60s. Also::: I think that during air conditioning season::: businesses and institutions should allow and encourage men in their offices (and classrooms and lecture halls) to dress with clothing as cooling as clothing that they allow women to wear::: including in the Wharton School. And even if a business or institution only purchases fossil-fuel-fre
e electricity::: if they use less electricity then this means more fossil-fuel-fre

"We write to provide you with the University‚Äôs current plans for the spring semester::: which will begin on January 20::: 2021.

The current fall semester has given us essential information and insights into how best to manage campus life as the pandemic continues its worldwide spread. With a limited number of students on campus and in West Philadelphia this fall::: we have been able to successfully minimize risk to our community through effective testing and tracing systems::: rigorous enforcement of the guidelines enacted to protect the health of our community and::: most importantly::: the conscientious commitment of students::: faculty and staff::: for which we are grateful.

As we approach the spring semester::: we have been working with Penn Medicine to dramatically expand our testing capacity. With additional testing available::: we are confident that we can support increased numbers of students returning to campus in January.

Students who choose to return to campus will be able to engage in a variety of small-group interactions and have access to library study space::: outdoor athletic facilities::: and other extracurricular activities::: all subject to public health guidelines and our Student Campus Compact.

The hybrid educational experiences for all students in the spring are likely to be similar to this fall: most classes will be delivered remotely::: with limited exceptions::: including courses with clinical experiences and in-person research required for graduation.

Adherence to the guidelines for conduct during the pandemic as outlined in the Student Campus Compact will continue to be required of all students. Among other conditions outlined in the Compact::: students are required to receive a flu shot before their return. Proof of immunization to the flu will be a condition of attendance.

To maximize our ability to protect the community from the coronavirus::: all undergraduates will be required to be tested for COVID-19 twice per week upon their return to campus::: and all graduate and professional students engaged in research activities on campus or living in the area once per week.

This has been a year where we have witnessed the repeated violent deaths of people of color::: and struggled with the emotions and rage that stirred. But Walter Wallace‚Äôs death is particularly hard for all of us at Penn::: because it occurred in our West Philadelphia community. He was our neighbor. And his loss is felt profoundly.

It is at times like this that we need to be particularly mindful of taking care of each other::: and remembering our common bond as a community here in West Philadelphia. We know that this is a particularly fraught time for students::: faculty and staff of color. Words alone will not soothe their anguish::: but we want them to know of our unequivocal support in this difficult hour.

We are also mindful of the needs of our West Philadelphia neighbors. Recently we announced Penn Medicine‚Äôs commitment to help transform Mercy Catholic Medical Center to ensure the continuity of care for the West Philadelphia community. It is an initiative that will::: among many other things::: provide important behavioral health services for the neighborhood.

We also want to remind the campus community of the mental health and support services available here at Penn. There are many places to turn for help in times of stress and grief. In addition to those formal channels::: we urge you to look out for each other. There has never been a more important time to be personally supportive of friends::: colleagues and classmates.

These are difficult times::: where there are no easy solutions. Our thoughts are with the family of Walter Wallace::: Jr.::: and our hope is that no other families suffer as they have this week.

PITY
If you see a man walking down the street without shoes.
Pity him not::: but pity yourself for not giving him yours.
It is not pitiful that a man has no shoes because he is poor.
But it is pitiful for you not to provide for your less fortunate
brother when you are able to afford.

Do not look with pity toward he who is blind.
But pity the fool who does not open his heart with goodness and kind.
The poor man's destiny is not one that he has chosen on his own.
For the rich man may go to sleep with everything and when he awakens
all is gone.

Pity not the man who is starving who has nothing to eat.
But pity the man who stomach is full from stealing another man's feast.
Do not pity upon others before looking upon yourself.
Is it the man who is being robbed who needs::: or is it the robber who
needs to seek help?

For the man being robbed may lose money::: but the robber has lost much more.
The robber may have his day now::: but later will be asked to even the score.
He who has forsaken his wife has not hurt her as dearly as he has hurt himself.
For what lies await for him is a thousand folds worse than what she has felt.
Suffer the child that comes unto me.
For he who hurt thee will find no pity.

"Statement on the Passing of Ruth Bader Ginsburg
From Amy Gutmann

Friday we lost one of the most respected::: and most beloved::: jurists of our time. A brilliant and barrier-breaking leader::: Ruth Bader Ginsburg brought forth her fiery commitment to justice and equality with the truest grit possible. No one has ever worked more tirelessly and effectively to advance the equal status of women through the law. At the same time::: Justice Ginsburg championed the ethical principles of equal liberty and human rights::: advancing the cause of justice everywhere. Her quiet passion and relentless work broke through political as well as legal barriers previously unimaginable::: but always warranted::: including equal pay for equal work.

Justice Ginsburg was a pioneer and an inspiration. It was my honor to award her an honorary degree from Penn in 2007::: and just two years ago to have her back on campus at Penn Law to celebrate her 25 years on the Supreme Court. In response to a student‚Äôs question::: Justice Ginsburg explained why it was that young people gave her optimism for the future. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs in your hands to see which way our country goes:::‚Äù Justice Ginsburg said. Her greatest legacy is to inspire us all to continue breaking down barriers to equal justice.

"We write today with an enormous sense of sadness. It had been our fervent hope since the outset of the coronavirus pandemic that public health measures and an increased availability of testing would allow us to offer our undergraduates a hybrid learning experience this fall that::: by including more remote learning::: social distancing and other safety precautions::: would enable all the students who desired it the opportunity to live and learn on campus.

Unfortunately::: COVID-19 continues to spread at an alarming rate across the country::: with approximately 2 million new cases reported over just the past month. Thus::: based on the advice of the leading health experts at Penn Medicine and on current public health restrictions::: with the full support of the Penn Board of Trustees::: we must share the deeply disappointing news that with only very limited exceptions for international students and those students dealing with significant housing or personal hardships::: we will not be able to accommodate undergraduate students in University housing.

Additionally::: we have determined to make tuition and fee adjustments for the fall semester. Tuition for the fall semester will be rolled back by 3.9%::: thus freezing tuition at last year‚Äôs rate::: and the General Fee will be reduced for the fall semester by 10%. Housing and dining fees that have been paid by students will be credited or refunded in full::: consistent with the methodology used in the spring.

KLEINMANENERGY.UPENN.EDU
Renewable Hydrogen: The Future of Storage and Fuel of the Future?",2020-08-09 15:00:13,Will they go away from using platinum as a catalyst?,"Green hydrogen is the most valuable commodity. It has the greatest energy density of any fuel::: so it does far more work than natural gas as it would be compressed::: giving it favorable parity (work to volume ratios).

Match to sustained wind streams::: either over the plains states or offshore::: and cash in. The US is said to be the Saudi Arabia of wind::: so hydrogen can build out accordingly.

The models for hydrogen are not yet set. Creating at ports for MHE or export::: or onsite::: would seem to be best::: for the time being.

Otherwise::: send forward by pipeline.

Hydrogen can also be made nightly::: when demand is low::: or when there are storms::: when there are conditions ripe for yielding more kinetic energy for wind turbines.

Beyond that::: the US has massive waste in its national grid system::: well over 10 quadrillion BTUs::: annually.

Since this energy is currently rejected energy::: the costs are zero marginal::: meaning that costs of H2 streams would be primarily associated with capital.

Capture portions of that as recycled energy::: i.e. as hydrogen. Hydrogen can replace fossil fuel in any application::: and be turned into many different key chemicals.

It does not hurt that the hydrogen economy is the key to solving climate change::: as well.

Europe is currently gearing their natural gas grid to become a hydrogen one::: so we have quite a bit of catching up to do.

There is no need to store all hydrogen::: so the figure stated is inaccurate. Europe will just keep hydrogen in pipelines::: a volume to match three months of use.

Hydrogen::: static type::: is to be stored in abandoned salt mines or fallow gas fields::: so the space available for strategic or collateral type storage is quite high in the US.

You can bank on vaulted (static) hydrogen::: so it is hard to say that this is a trivial innovation set in the energy sector.

"**CONTENT WARNING: THIS ARTICLE ADDRESSES TEENAGE SUICIDALITY**

If you or someone you know is in crisis::: you can call the National Suicide Prevention Hotline 24 hours a day: 1-800-273-8255. More resources available here: https://caps.byu.edu/community-resources

Researchers from BYU::: Johns Hopkins::: and Harvard have created an algorithm that can predict suicidal thoughts and behavior among teens with 91% accuracy. The team said the implications of the research are critical for prevention programming and policy making. Specifically::: they hope policymakers use the findings to prepare services::: resources::: and assessments aimed at school::: community and family settings.

This study identified three risk factors that are the leading predictors of suicidal thoughts and behavior among teenagers: being threatened or harassed through digital media; being picked on or bullied by a student at school; exposure or involvement in serious arguments and yelling at home.

“Clearly the results speak to the need for prevention and schools may be the best place to start by helping to mitigate bullying and online harassment:::"" said study coauthor Carl Hanson::: professor of public health at BYU. ""For communities::: we need programming that can help support and strengthen the family.”

BYU algorithm accurately predicts when teens likely to have suicidal thoughts::: behavior",11/17/2021 17:18,"The algorithm doesn't sound that accurate. 91% accurate means that of 100 teens that it identifies as suicidal 9 actually aren't. And then of the 91 that are accurately diagnosed::: I'd assume a large portion of them are obviously struggling and this tool didn't add new information.

I would hate to have a parent or school counselor call me in to talk about my misdiagnosed suicidal thoughts. Potential users of this are going to forget very quickly that it has an error rate.

Great job to this team who finally ended the losing streak!!,I've been married to a U fan for 13 years. Until tonight we've only won once. So happy to be the one cheering this time!!!,It was honestly a very well played game. If we can play Broncos how we played Utah::: it will be an easy win. We need Jaren Hall for this one now that he's all rested up!,Great game all around::: every single player or coach that participated. But Jaren Hall is the man.,I am close to tears!!! It’s just before 8:00am here in Heidelberg and I just woke up the entire town!!!,Jared Hall played incredible. While his stats were not particularly flashy::: he made great decisions and didn't turn it over. The future is bright for that young man. However::: our defense really shined tonight. What an incredible effort tonight,I predicted BYU to win by 10 points. OK so I was off by 1 point. Great win!,It feels so good! I was already so happy with the Big 12 news. This is a big fat RED cherry on top of this weekend! Ha!,Wasn't that an unusual downpour?,What has it been like 742 days since Utah last beat BYU in football 😂,What was the score?,Good win for the Cougars! Too bad the head coach was acting the fool at the end of the game.,So happy right now. Best coaching I’ve seen from BYU in years. Way to keep pressuring on defense and the offense scored when it was needed. Go Cougars!!!,Gives a small amount of validation to the power 5 call up. New chapter ahead for the program and it’s looking good ❤️,Yay! Go Cougars! I bet the University of Utah hates that I showed up with my family with the three of us wearing blue out of the five of us. We sat in the front of the Union cheering and singing. It felt so good leaving at halftime leading and now we win. Wahoo! Nicely done.,Great win BYU!,What a great game! 🎉,Yeah!!!!!!!

"OFFICIAL: Brigham Young University has accepted an invitation to join the Big 12 Conference.

“This is a historic day for BYU Athletics – and for the entire university:::” said Kevin J Worthen::: BYU president. “The BYU mission statement indicates that BYU is a place where ‘a commitment to excellence is expected.’ We strive to meet that requirement in all we do::: including our core academic enterprise. Membership in the Big 12 gives us the opportunity to reinforce that commitment for student-athletes::: allowing them to compete at the highest level both on and off the field.”

A Thing of Beauty: BYU’s Own Mr. Rogers (aka Dorie Haws) on the Honesty of Children

Children aren’t brutally honest::: explains Dorie Haws::: head teacher at the BYU Child and Family Studies Lab. They’re just calling it how they see it! Taking her cue from Mister Rogers::: Haws has found that learning to listen and really understanding children leads to inspiring findings: the complexity of their minds::: the beauty of having no filter::: and the strength of their connection to God. When working with children::: Dorie Haws feels it is ""a beautiful day in the neighborhood.""",8/6/2021 0:49,Paige Nelson Smith you'd love this. :),Love her!

"BYU biology graduate student Natalie Saxton is part of a team of BYU biologists that has been tracking down dragonflies around the world::: from Vietnam to the islands of Vanuatu. Their goal is to piece together the first-ever phylogenic (genealogical) tree of all 6:::300 known dragonfly species and their ancestors.

Funded by the National Science Foundation::: the phylogenic tree will enable scientists to study how different species of dragonfly evolved over time through changes in characteristics like vision and flight::: which may in turn illuminate how other animals speciate.

Both the novelty and the usefulness of the work has been thrilling for the scientists.

“You kind of feel like one of your biology heroes:::” said Saxton::: “going out into the wilderness at the edge of the world to find new species.”

Many of these people have concluded that the universe began as a “big bang” that eventually resulted in the creation of our planet and life upon it.

"Immigrant communities such as a Jewish settlement in Clarion and a Thai community in Layton may not be as well-known or remembered but still play an important part of Utah’s history — a history rich with diverse stories of faith and perseverance. With the passage of time::: however::: many of the stories of Utah’s immigrants are on the verge of being lost.

BYU history professor and Associate Director of the BYU Redd Center::: Brenden W. Rensink::: hopes to change that through a new website and mobile app called Intermountain Histories — a platform dedicated to highlighting significant places and people who helped shape the history of the Intermountain West. The project is managed and edited by Rensink while students from multiple regional universities contribute individual stories.

""Too often we stop with the most obvious histories::: or the histories that we grew up hearing::: and we never pause to ask::: ‘What else is out there?’” Rensink states. “There are infinitely more perspectives::: voices and stories that we haven’t heard than ones we have::: and you don’t have to dig very far to find them.”

"As social media and other online networking sites have grown in usage::: so too has trolling - an internet practice in which users intentionally seek to draw others into pointless and::: at times::: uncivil conversations.

New BYU research sheds light on the motives and personality characteristics of internet trolls. This research found that individuals who experienced pleasures from the failings or shortcomings of others considered trolling to be acceptable online behavior. Because of this view::: they're not concerned with how their words or actions affect those on the other side of the screen.

BYU communication professor and co-author of this study::: Dr. Pamela Brubaker said::: ""As we connect with people online::: we should strive to be more respectful of others and other points of view. [...] Each of us has the power to be an influence for good online.""

Because for them::: that is positive reinforcement to continue their behavior. I also think that there is some confusion on the definition of ""trolling:::"" I wish the video had talked about that before delving into the outcomes of their research.",Trolling is not pointless. If executed properly::: its purpose is to satirize and expose foolish views in front of an online audience.,"Um::: who gets to decide what constitutes pointless conversations::: Pamela? I know that's a base you and yours would love to steal::: calling all those who disagree with you trolls. Unfortunately::: I think we'll deny you that right.

Trolling is characterized by the state of mind of the troller::: not the trollee. If the person making a contradictory argument has no desire to have a true exchange of ideas but rather::: gets his or her jollies from winding up others::: then you have a troller. Your discussion of Dark Triad::: which is actually a tired::: unhelpful::: faddish ""diagnosis:::"" might have some merit.

If the person making a contradictory comment is truly intending to contend with a tough::: controversial topic::: you do NOT have a troll. You have someone who disagrees with you::: whose opposition and arguments cannot be blithely dismissed. Certainly::: you CAN dismiss that opposition . . . with better arguments.",It doesn't matter how stupid or illogical the things you say are::: we should defend the right for you to say them.

Ironic a person claiming distain for personally attacking people online is now popularizing and spreading a subjective term that allows you to make huge assumptions about the person character of other people you have never met simply because they use humor to tear down stupid ideas. But she does it in fancy academic speak so it’s all good.

"It's official––fall semester 2021 will be a traditional semester with the majority of courses offered in-person with full-capacity classrooms.

Fall semester 2021 will operate like a traditional fall semester due to the downward trend in COVID-19 infections and increased number of vaccinations within the campus community.

BYU will also be evaluating how virtual learning may have improved some elements of courses and curricula and hopes to incorporate the best of those changes as it prepares for a more traditional fall semester.

Masks and physical distancing will not be required during fall semester. This decision is subject to change depending on trends in disease prevalence and guidance from state and local governments. Individuals may choose to wear a mask in any setting.

"How often have you laid in bed scrolling through news stories::: social media or responding to a text? After staring at the screen::: have you ever found that it is harder to fall asleep?

Until recently::: claims of better sleep due to Night Shift have been theoretical. However::: a new study from BYU published in ""Sleep Health"" challenges the premise made by phone manufacturers and found that the Night Shift functionality does not actually improve sleep.

Bates’ passion for wildlife stretches back to his childhood years::: where he fondly recalls spending summers living in the mountains and working with his father::: the game manager for Utah’s Division of Wildlife Resources.

“That’s where I developed a love for the outdoors and for all creatures:::” he said. “I knew then that I wanted to be a wildlife biologist.”

"Now a successful fourth-year business Ph.D. student at the University of Michigan::: BYU alumna Hilary Hendricks can remember earlier days when—having moved her family across the country to attend a top program—she felt herself unequal to the challenges of doctoral study. What kept her going were her mentors from her previous time as a BYU MBA student.

“I’d be walking across campus in Ann Arbor thinking::: ‘There’s just no way I can do this.’ But then ... I would recite to myself all of the professors at BYU who helped me to get where I was:::"" says Hendricks.

The excellent preparation Hendricks received for graduate school is reflected in data from the National Science Foundation::: which shows that BYU prepares more future Ph.D. students in both business management and foreign languages than any other university in the United States. The data also shows that BYU graduates have outsized success completing doctoral programs in a host of other areas::: including chemical engineering::: education research::: mechanical engineering and psychology.

BYU has long been recognized as a top school for preparing future doctoral students::: ranking sixth in the nation for the number of students who go on to earn doctoral degrees::: according to the federally sponsored Survey of Earned Doctorates. From 2009 to 2018::: 3:::040 former BYU students completed a Ph.D.::: an average of about 300 per year.

She contacted Larsen::: expressing the need to help their peers who were in similar situations. Seals created an online survey that allowed BYU students who were experiencing isolation to virtually connect with other students and request a care package to be delivered to their doorstep.

"After careful consideration of the present circumstances and in an effort to comply with federal::: state and Church guidelines::: the decision has been made for BYU’s commencement ceremonies on April 22::: 2021::: to be held virtually. The commencement exercises and speeches will be broadcast live on BYUtv from the Marriott Center.

“This decision was not made lightly::: and we know how disappointing this news may be for you and your loved ones:::” said BYU Academic Vice President Shane Reese. “We look forward::: however::: to the opportunity to recognize our outstanding students as graduates with perhaps ‘less pomp::: but more circumstance.’ Our COVID circumstances have provided opportunities for unique recognitions that are commensurate with our truly remarkable graduates.”

More details about the specific commencement program as well as convocations will be announced shortly. In the meantime::: all things graduation can be found at graduation.byu.edu.",2/24/2021 15:22,With a 99.991% survivability rate this makes complete sense to fear. You know::: because fear is clearly more powerful than faith.,So glad that BYU cares about the health of the grads and their families. I️ wish more people would show that they care. #maskup,This is ridiculous. The risk to the students is so minimal of getting sick::: that they should be living their lives as normal::: other than avoiding people risk categories. Those people in risk categories could watch the ceremonies virtually. With social distancing and smaller crowds there should be so little risk especially in April. By then there will be so many vaccinations and reduced numbers of infection that not having graduation is going to look like an unnecessary sacrifice.,Hilarious::: 4 years of hard work with tens of thousands of dollars invested. It’s like running a marathon only to get to the end and cross a finish line that’s been packed up and put away.,So we can have the super bowl and other large gatherings but not graduation? This is so pathetic. Big important life events are reduced to virtual 😥,Then why are the temples reopening. We just had a superbowl (did thousands die)? When can we try to move on? Why are students allowed on campus::: dorms and classrooms?,"I feel like there were more choices here besides just Option A) Hold regular graduation and Option B) Don't hold regular graduation. We could have limited the in-person ceremony to graduates only (approx 4:::300 according to the web - and if 6:::000 people can come to a football game::: 4300 grads can come to the stadium and walk) with families joining virtually. We could have rapidly tested all graduates 24-48 before graduation and those with a positive test stay home. We could have opted for multiple ceremonies across three days with sanitizing in between...or here's a thought! Do ALL the things! We've implemented and are already working within so many safety measures for school/church/
travel::: I'm not sure why we're not using them here?!","The Lord has prepared the strongest people for these::: the hardest days of this earth. Congratulations
to the class of 2021! You will go down in history as one of the finest and the bravest. No virus or the lack of ceremonies can take away the efforts and hard work you have endured til this day. You are much stronger for it. Life is changing for everyone. Those with eyes to see::: can see it. Keep up the good work! Go forward in faith and the blessings of prosperity awaits you::: no matter how hard things may be today. 👏🌈❤️","This makes me so sad. I graduate this June and feel robbed of my experience. But I understand why they are doing it and I’d rather forgo this event if it means people are safe.especially
older family members who might want to attend.",Wow. There really is zero courage left in the world. Weak and Pathetic decision.,"Honestly::: if you believe in the Mormon faith and don’t believe that Covid-19 is real or deadly::: then I can see where you might think that your graduation ceremony is more important! Wow. Woke??? You have a long long way to go. Congratulations
on your graduation::: college is an accomplishment.
You might want to thank the people that afforded you that luxury and show them why you were able to do it::: instead of whining about a ceremony that most folks want to skip.
Covid -19 can be a deadly illness and should be taken seriously.",After careful consideration of the fact that Communists have taken over the country through subterfuge and that we as a University want to fly below the radar as long as possible so we can continue to operate without being attacked::: the decision has been made to have a virtual graduation.,"“Our Covid circumstances”.
.. aren’t you done beating that tired::: EXHAUSTED horse?

Hold the graduation and let people decide for themselves who will attend and who won’t.

You know::: like that crazy agency thing??","I graduate this semester. I rather be done with COVID than attending in-person ceremony.
The risk of skyrocketing the case and losing more lives to COVID is not worth the graduation ceremony. This is how I see it - welcome to disagree with my point of view.",Sad. Missed my daughter’s HS graduation last year and now can’t attend my son’s college graduation. First child to graduate from college.,"Insert eye roll again. I’m done::: we are all actually done::: really just done. Driving/
Traffic deaths still rise over 1.3 million per year world wide and yet...nothing but crickets called tickets in our country. Nearly 10:::000 in the US alone are alcohol related and prohibition has yet to set in. Car Crashes kill us and others around you a whole lot faster. So why no moratorium for driving? Some virus they recognize nationally as “created” and we do nothing literally nothing except lock up everyone who isn’t the problem. We lock up the good people::: the uninflected::: and we stuff our old folks into nursing homes so they can get sick and die. 100% equivalent to throwing them into a taxi with a drunk driver and hoping they make it home ok. Enough.",Thank you BYU::: for taking the lead in this and planning a safe alternative. Although many will be unhappy with this::: it is the correct decision in the midst of an ongoing pandemic. I appreciate this! And congrats to the graduates! Your graduation may not be the traditional one::: but you will be celebrated amongst your peers and family for your hard work.,BYU professor here. Of course I’m saddened and disappointed by this news. I always delight in seeing families enjoy graduation festivities. However::: to those at odds with the university’s decision or who feel as though this is a slap in the face at the very end of your BYU experience::: I personally take that as a slap in the face as well. I would hope your most cherished take-away from higher education would be the education. I’m considering what circumstances would otherwise warrant virtual or cancelled commencement - would we move forward into our fields of work or further study after graduation with the knowledge and positivity a BYU grad should have::: or sulk? Most scheduled large gatherings of any kind have been cancelled until either late summer or fall of this year. BYU is not alone. Don’t single us out.,Thank you! I support this decision completely.,"I earned a masters degree from BYU in 1976. In those days we had to have permission to skip the graduation ceremonies. I had other responsibilitie
s and chose to get that permission. I had my memories and my diploma - my ticket to the career I wanted. In the 45 years since then::: I have never regretted missing all the pomp and circumstance.",BYU is coming out of my will. To be sure it was only in as a contingency but even that token will be removed.,You’re not keeping anyone safe. You’re just another institution trying to have good PR and not ruffle any woke mob feathers. Those that don’t want to get Covid and don’t want to be at a commencement won’t go... those that want to go should be able to go. Simple as that. As someone who’s graduating— don’t expect a single cent from me as an alumni.,It is a very American thing I see in these comments about the low risk to the young students. The idea that everyone should be able to just make decisions about themselves and not care if it hurts anyone else. The myopic narcissism is pretty astonishing. Yes those students will almost certainly survive from covid if they catch it in a superspreader celebration of themselves. But the grandparents they have dinner with might not::: the patient of the nurse they spread it to in the grocery store might not. I have patients with disabilities who have not left their homes in a year. But when community rates get high thanks to low risk people who don’t think beyond themselves - nurses catch it in the community::: doctors catch it::: people that others people with disabilities literally cannot live without catch it. Then the most careful::: the most vulnerable will catch it and die. For a religion based on community and helping the ‘least’ it certainly has fully moved to the American ideal of I’ve got mine - everything else is your problem. It’s kind of disgusting.,What efforts has BYU made to oppose draconian::: ineffective::: and unscientific lockdown policies at the state and federal level?,At this rate just make BYU an online school if they’re going to lock us down forever like this,I didn't even go to my college graduation. I just wanted to start my career and get moving.,It’s starting to feel like the liberals in the church run the show. Oh well::: whatever. The rest of us don’t have to live in fear!,Bummer...this is the year I have my last TWO kids graduating BYU. It’s the end of an era for us. Very disappointing.,I am sure that decision was made by a Prophet of God!!!,Seems like some creativity could be used here. Use the outdoor stadium::: let students be in person::: broadcast it for older family members or others not comfortable attending::: have the big ceremony virtual and smaller ceremonies in person. So many things could be done besides just making the whole thing virtual. It's so sad for these kids. Put some creative students in charge of planning instead of fearful adults and you might be surprised what you get.,I know this is very disappointing to so many::: but thank you for making this tough decision responsibly.,death rate of 20ish yr olds .002! BYU I'm ashamed of you.,Church needs to go ahead and break ties with BYU like they did scouts. BYU is commie and liberal viewed anyway...,Extremely sad and disappointed in BYU. Wish they could have at least done something like this for us graduates last year (2020).,This is a major experience of college. Not getting the full experience should not get the full tuition.,The most special moment from my graduation is when they asked grads to turn and look at the people in the crowd who helped them get here. Hopefully this year's grads can create a moment like that with a little creativity.,If they've been able to be on campus all year::: they should be able to have an in person graduation.,Weird that people are losing their minds about this yet the general authorities and apostles announced general conference will be virtual and not a peep 🤷🏻‍♂️,I would better be able to support this decision if they were not just starting to allow fans into games to watch. Why can athletes have people in the stands but students can’t even have a graduation ceremony where they are the only ones present?,"Honestly::: this is best thing that can happen to commencements.

You can mute out the speakers you don't want to hear. You can stay in regular clothes. You won't have to spend money on graduation robes. And then you can leave from your house to go out to eat and celebrate.

No long line of people walking to the stage to get a diploma case and a quick picture.",The most important way to end time spent getting a degree at BYU is receiving the degree. Excited for my BIL to finish up this spring and happy to celebrate with him virtually!,A lot of people will be vaccinated by then. Why don’t you consider holding the event outside? Online truly is not the same. Graduation day for me was a multi-sensory experience: the sounds of people shuffling in their robes::: the air on my smiling cheeks as I walked across the bridge into the Marriott Center. It was an unforgettable joyous day.,Not sure why BYU couldn’t do smaller department graduations!,This is ridiculous. We can go to Walmart and Costco every week but can’t have graduation ceremonies? This is insanity.,"Use the money saved for all the regalia for your private celebration. Treat yourself to something special. Congratulations
! On enduring to the end!","This is good! Thank you.
Stop complaining everyone. It makes you sound so spoiled and it's gross. I didn't have a junior high::: or high school graduation. I was really looking forward to college::: but guess what? We are in the middle of a pandemic. Do your part and stop complaining. There are people dying. Still.","Regardless::: isn't it interesting that the Pandemic no longer applies to Air Travel? I mean::: not really.
It's okay to cram 100 people into a flying metal tube::: without social distancing::: because the masks really do work. Right?
Now Wait! Think about it!",Time to move on and open up! Life goes on!,You can feel sad and upset about not having the experience while still understanding why this is happening! I’m supposed to walk in April::: but now I don’t have the grand experience::: and I am sad about it. But::: I also want me and my family to be safe. Life is about sacrifices::: and this is one of them. Take pictures in your cap and gown in front of all the BYU signs and walk around campus taking in your last days there. It will be okay.,Since Covid is the 3rd leading cause of death in the US::: and it's contagious::: this decision is necessary ... even though it's disappointing.,This makes me sad. My sister in law is a registered nurse working at a front range local IHC hospital They have no dedicated wing/area for COVID patients any more. If someone comes in with symptoms they are treated and taken care of. If the sick can be treated like this then the well should be treated like this.,Way to be a follower and not a leader BYU way to have fear over faith. Way to teach this future generation to act like sheep. EVERYTHING against all we have been taught. This all with a 99.991% survival. Can’t imagine what decisions you would make with a real crisis. What a disappointment you are,Take a stand for something::: BYU! This is ridiculous. You don’t accept federal funds for a reason. You do it so you don’t have to follow federal guidelines or federal mandates. Stop trying to be like the rest of the universities in this country. It’s good to be different and to go against the prevailing winds of state control.,I don’t even remember who spoke at my graduation! What I do remember is the great work I was able to do because of my education! Pomp and circumstance don’t really mean a lot!,By the end of April::: infection rates will have dropped significantly (like they already have) and many more of us will be vaccinated. Don't act like this decision is based on science. It's based on fear of the woke leftist mob's backlash. Such a massive shame. I'm glad to be done with BYU because they seem to go downhill every year when they make decisions that cater to the left's ideology.,If you’re not graduating this April::: do not comment on here about how you’re happy for BYU. No one cares. You’re not graduating.,"Boring exercise in Mammon’s honors anyway. Zion or bust.

But congrats to the grads who actually sought learning by study and faith out of the best books. Now::: go build up Zion. 🙏","Lest we forget::: graduation was held virtually last year too. Now we have two years worth of BYU graduates who didn’t physically attend a ceremony. I get it. It’s disappointing. But life is full of disappointments
. You pick yourself up and move on. Be grateful you are part of the few who get to graduate at all.","So faith in the vaccine and almost half of the country infected and survived isn't enough to get back to normal....?!?!
😒🤳🏼",Folks::: it’s about time spent with others that might be exposed or sick. I still see no intelligence about real science or illness. I say this is a good way to discover if your religious believes are right or not. Dear God::: preserve the feeble minded. Amen. It makes me angry that people do not believe that this is a true illness with potential for grave outcomes if you do t protect yourself and your family. It Has NOTHING TO DO WITH POLITICS!!!! Please listen.,So much fear. BYU graduates are nearly all young.,I was clearly born 20 years too early. Kids these days are so spoiled 🤣,This for the age group lest likely to have any problems from covid and those that are could use their brain and not go. PC everywhere are they afraid of public opinion?,But yet congregations are holding in person church all over the state? Inside a building? Why don't they just spread it out over a week like they were considering. This is just ridiculous. If everyone makes up it would be fine. Have you been to a Costco on Saturday? This is just mind bending. And people are just going to hold grad parties right afterwards. Come on. SMH.,Just another example of the admin putting fans who donate to them above the actual students. Sports get spectators::: the fans and donors are kept happy. Absolutely no reason BYU couldn't make an effort to have a socially distanced graduation! The only ones who NEED to be there are the seniors. This is just a public show that they are doing something with the pandemic::: anyone on campus knows social distancing and masks are a joke.,My daughter didn’t even get a commencement last year. I’m glad they’re doing something.,Definitely an upgrade from last year! Good to see responsible and supportive choices being made.,How about you do both? Virtual and in person. Let people choose!!,Good for you! It's not like you need to have a ceremony to have a valid degree. Doesn't show on a resume.,"But look at the bright side...now you can save money not traveling...and
you don’t have to post later about: “My word::: if I have to attend another graduation-type
ceremony it will be too soon!” 😉👍","People there are so many horrible things happening in the world right now to all kinds of people::: believe me you are all blessed to a degree that you don't even know.
Please STOP complaining. Just appreciate.",Why make this decision now? Heck mask mandates will be gone by April,You allow students to attend basketball games but not willing to hold commencement or convocation ceremonies. How sad that these are your priorities. Our only child graduates next month and you have robbed all of us of this important experience.,So glad the traffic jams associated with BYU commencement will not be happening this year. That virtual thing has virtue! Thanks!,Sorry 😞 I did not go to my BYU graduation and it is one of the life regrets. But hopefully the impacted students will have really fun celebrations with lived ones to compensate.,I hope that small convocations can happen. Even if it is just the graduates in person and everyone else virtual. These kids have worked so hard and need to be celebrated!,well the good news is there will be significantly less robes of a false priesthood this year. The bad news is that it was done in the name of another false priesthood...,"This entire thread makes me worried. It's like::: ""church leaders are only inspired if it follows my predetermined beliefs.""",Thanks BYU for caring about the health and wellbeing of students and faculty. Sorry for those that will not have a graduation ceremony but think about the staff members at BYU which are part of a COVID high risk group.,We live in a litigious PR world. Can you imagine the media uproar (and lawsuits) if even one case were traced to the graduation ceremony? Thank you BYU for going above and beyond to navigate this corona craziness. This Ute is a mom of a current Cougar.,While I understand this with a lot of crowd and so on::: I wish BYU has done something that Texas A&M is going to do by spreading ceremonies in a week or two span instead of in 2 days. Or maybe use the football stadium... Oh well.,This is such a heartless college. The things you make students go through on top of the graduation application almost 8 months prior for a $15 fee is insane. You all are real pieces of work. What a shame for these students who endured so much.,You should have done something like this spring 2020! Why didn’t you? Shameful!,By end of April most older adults and many::: many younger::: will have been vaccinated. I believe this is all about LAWSUITS.,"My original response to a post got deleted so I’ll repost here since it applies to the murmurers here.

The children of Israel wandered the desert with affliction and disappointment for FORTY years and here we are not even one year into this and are crying::: “how long::: O Lord?”. Patience and faith.",Xander This means that since you already have Hunter's cap and gown::: we can come whenever the weather is nice and take all the pictures with no one else getting in our way. We can also go to whatever restaurant you want whenever you want and not get booted out because we are taking too long. ;) -\-\ Also::: now we have something else in common. I didn't walk either.,Guidelines? Stop trying to impress the progressive left and just do the right thing.,"I’m not going to read all 720 comments that are before be at this point so I’m sure this has been said or asked...
Why are you selling tickets to the last 2 basketball games now and making a definite decision about graduation now?!
I’m not condemning your decision to hold an in person graduation::: I just think the timing of announcing selling limited seats to the basketball games is unfortunate timing and a poor decision.",How can the university justify cancelling graduation ceremonies while allowing basketball games? It is the same building either way.,Stop virtue signaling and start fighting for religious and personal freedoms like other churches are doing. You have become the great and spacious building to curry favor of the world.,Thank you for doing your best to keep us safe! ♥️,Yet the men’s basketball is bringing fans into the Marriott center for this weeks’ games??? makes sense::: BYU! 🙄,"Again::: I ask::: not just in light of this::: or any decisions like it...
If MASKS work::: why can't you have thos and every other function?
If masks work::: why in the world do we have to social distance?
If masks don't work::: why the heck must we wear them to ""protect "" others::: who could choose to stay home or whatever?
Sorry::: really not related to BYU::: per se..just pushed by LOGIC buttons!!!!","From my son today who will be finishing his degree next month..and won’t have a graduation ceremony:

There will officially be no in person convocations for any of the programs at BYU::: even though they just had a basketball game with over 2:::000 people present haha",This is so sad for the kids. I trust the Administration but what a tough. decision this must have been. Frustrating but understandable.,Yet basketball games can now be attended? Idk if I’m liking these priorities.,🙄🙄🙄 if you're saying that BYU is run by communists based on this decision than BYU really did fail you.,So sad. This was the same last year for my granddaughter and grandson. 😣,So much better than sitting in small chairs at the Marriott. I would have been for this 5 years ago.,How can high schools and kindergartens manage graduations but colleges mail you your degree?,Gotta hide this post. When is this going to stop::: let's move already and quit living like this.,If its gonna be virtual. Why would anyone want to listen to it? Seriously! No one wants to listen to your BS talks about how it's now time to go out into the world and make it grow!,I was told that the reason there wasn’t widespread Covid events at blm protests is because they were largely outdoors and people wore masks. Logic tells me that using a similar approach here should yield a similar result. What am I missing?,Religion and science meet with intelligence. 🤩,The Study out of Sweden show transmission of Coivd from child to adult doesn't happen. This is a huge lie.,What is disappointing are all the political statements on this string. Some sifting appears to be going on here. That's certainly one of the spiritual purposes of the virus. Reminds me of the children of Israel following Moses.,"Good for them.

It also makes me worried there will be spikes again or that maybe the vaccine won’t really help.",I was in California.,“Your will”?? We know we’ll live to see the second coming. We’re both to hardheaded to die.,Yes we should comply with the government.. keep up the fear mongering,I graduated last year. It’s nice that I was mailed the piece of paper and square hat::: but after five years of college education::: I still don’t feel like I graduated. 🤷🏻‍♂️,So sad that life's events are interrupted and changed forever it seems by this virus...,I’m losing faith in people to see the truth of the purpose of this virus. We need to just rise up and say no! The removal of freedom is killing us faster than this virus!,So we can do basketball games but not graduation?,Amazing to see so many people complaining.. Then you understand why so many people didn't believe in Christ despite witnessing His miracles... You are lucky you haven't been affected by the virus and that you haven't lost a dear friend or family member::: hopefully despite your arrogance it stays swell for you. If the ceremony means so much to you and your children::: make one in your house::: make the mistake of inviting everyone you would have invited to the commencement::: simple as that... Complaining and blaming it on the liberals won't change anything::: the decision is made::: stop being selfish.,Fear fear fear. I’m so sick of living in fear.,The virus does not warrant these extremes,I didn't finish school (thank goodness) so I could care less but GO COUGS!!! 🤣🤣🤣,"Was this decision made after much fasting and praying? Nope! BYU is cowering to government tyranny. So much for ""doubt not::: fear not.""",So glad that BYU cares!,Is Jim McMahon graduating ?,"So many are paranoid about the virus. The following worked —

“In the 60s::: the KGB did some fascinating psychological experiments. They learned that if you bombard human subjects with fear messages nonstop::: in two months or less::: most of the subjects are completely brainwashed to believe the false message to the point that no amount of clear information they are shown to the contrary can change their mind.”

If the same response were made to this virus as with SARS1::: then it most likely would not be any worse. SARS1 is 78% identical to this virus. We have been lies to about every part of this virus. We have been and continue to be played. And you would think that BYU would know how to use common sense and logic to see what has been going on::: but the KGB experiments seem to have worked very well in all aspects of this virus.","So sorry Ally Barry ! You deserve better and so do all the other graduates. Congratulations
on your achievements! I'm so proud of you!!!!",So sad. Robbing these kids of all the hard work. They deserve to be recognized. Shame on you BYU.,No one said this would be easy.,So grateful to see science and logical thought being applied.,All the hotels and restaurants probably aren’t happy.,Dang::: well at least I don’t have to buy a cap and gown,Not to mention the entire school year has been online. All the tuition and costs but none of the experience.,What’s really sad is watching people and institutions give in to the fear. Our pioneer ancestors who endured mobocracy::: famine::: disease::: and numerous other challenges just might be hanging their heads in shame at the fear of a disease with a 98% recovery rate.,Can y'all just mail me some free stuff as compensation? lol,I didn’t even walk when I graduated 😆,You guys realize you're NOT paying for your kids graduation ceremony right? You are paying for their EDUCATION. An education that will allow them to be a productive human in society. I understand that formalities are really important to some people but in all reality the degree is what your child is after. Not a fun party with their friends. It's beyond unfortunate but the negative comments from parents are really petty. Good grief.,BYU caved.,Sad that BYU has to bend over to the government,The Graduation Ceremony is SO important to the graduate and family. When I finished on a serious shoestring budget::: I couldn't even afford the announcements. I have always regretted the decision not to tie that shoestring a little tighter so I could have at least sent them::: even if I couldn't do the cap and gown part. I am so sorry to hear this sad decision::: but on the other hand::: at least now the family and loved ones can attend virtually. Thanking God for the technology and asking Him to bless America!,So glad BYU cares about legal liability so they don’t get sued.,The world will not end::: even though I think that this is a bit extreme.,"Oh disheartening..
. it’s been over a year ..",If masks work.......,It’s going to be okay.,I think if you don't invite a fun guest speaker::: it probably doesn't matter.,Just pretend it's a football game,Because robbing one graduating class wasn't enough....,They need to quit bowing to the tyrants,Bought in,No wonder so many members vote democrat.,You all going to byu ...its a privileged to attend such school ...it has been my dream school but here i am. I'm about to run a post graduate program here ::: and because of this pandemic everything has gone up...so please am seeking for sponsors please ...,Gross. Puppets of the deep state 100%.,"You can pull a straw man on me if you want::: but then that defeats the point of actual debate. Here's what I think (with links and references):
(1)""Those who govern their thoughts and actions solely by the principles of liberalism or conservatism or intellectualism
cannot be expected to agree with all of the teachings of the gospel of Jesus Christ. As for me::: I find some wisdom in liberalism::: some wisdom in conservatism::: and much truth in intellectualism
—but I find no salvation in any of them.”
(-Dallin H Oaks) This school’s selling point isn't conservative or liberal ideals::: but the Gospel of Jesus Christ.

(2) “In order to complain::: you have to know there is something better available that you would prefer...but that you are not willing to take the necessary action to create. You would rather complain because it protects you from having to take the risk to create the way you want. When you complain::: what you’re really saying is:::‘I have something I prefer::: but I’m not willing to risk creating it...so I’ll complain to you instead’”If you really want to see change::: why are you complaining on Facebook? Write to the leaders of the school explaining your case. Perhaps then you will get the answers or the change you seek.

(3) I go to BYU. I go to a school that “is 80% cheaper than the national average private non-profit four year college tuition of $29:::191. The cost is 55% cheaper than the average Utah tuition of $12:::890 for 4 year colleges.” They are cutting me a deal financially so saying that because I paid “lots of money” I “deserve” a commencement ceremony is a bit selfish. Albeit::: I am not graduating this year. However::: BYU students seem to have a much bigger stake in graduation than those who are not students in this chat...

(4) I decided to come to this University. I signed the honor code saying that I will::: “Obey the law and follow campus policies.” Is this not a campus policy decision? It's not fair to paint this as BYU reneging on their agreement as a university::: when I am the one who is doing just that as an individual.

Our days were numbered from the moment we took our first breath. Life isn’t a race where we win against the inevitable! That has not changed since the beginning of time!
BUT::: we should not be forced to live in fear.
We went from being a free nation to being told we:
🚫 couldn’t go to school
🚫 couldn’t go to church
🚫 couldn’t go to our grandma's house
🚫 couldn’t pay respects to a loved one through a funeral
🚫 couldn’t leave our homes
...and when we were allowed to do these things::: we were told:
📢 how long we could be there
📢 how far apart we have to be
📢 which direction to walk
📢 what to wear
📢 what we can buy/not buy
📢 where we could shop/not shop
📢 whether we could sing/worship/
take communion
📢 what time we had to be home
Yes::: our health matters.
But you know what else matters?
✅ Family.
✅ Friends.
✅ Church.
✅ School.
✅ Sporting events.
✅ Family vacations.
✅ Neighborhood BBQs.
✅ Life.
✅ Fitness.
✅ Hugs.
✅ visiting the hospitalized
Etc..etc...
💔 One day::: you’ll hug your grandma::: mom::: dad::: or brother for the last time.
💔 One day::: your best friend will cry on your shoulder for the last time.
💔 One day::: your child will play their last hockey game.
💔 One day::: they’ll have their last day of school.
💔 One day::: you’ll spend your last day laughing with a loved one.
💔 One day::: you’ll dance your last dance.
Don’t waste the days you have by living in fear.
Your time here on earth matters.
Live your life while you have the chance.
God is gonna call you home when it’s your time.

"The cooking sessions in BYU professor Marie Orton’s Italian 361 class represent her passion for helping students to connect—with each other::: with her::: with the subject matter. Orton said her teaching methods are inspired partly by the examples of many colleagues in the unique language programs at BYU::: which offers its students immersive course experiences in 63 languages and which ranks third in the nation for the most bachelor degrees in a foreign language.

Orton’s fall class investigated what makes Italians “Italian”: how history::: politics::: sports::: fashion::: music::: literature and (of course) food create a common identity among a people who unified from a loose group of nation-states less than two hundred years ago.

Teaching a typically in-person experience—cooking as a class—into a virtual experience is no small feat::: but Professor Orton believes it has kept the Italian mentality of cooking food together intact.

“In Italy::: food and group identity are inseparable:::” she explained. “Everybody who goes there realizes very fast::: food is about anticipating and preparing::: cooking with other people::: letting a sauce boil down for six hours and talking about it as you eat it. It’s all about what we’re doing together.”

“One thing that I’ve loved about Professor Orton’s class is that she is really good at bringing us close to the things that we’re learning about:::” said BYU senior Emma Stucki. “Technology can be a barrier sometimes::: but it was lovely to share Italian food culture as a class.”",1/26/2021 16:56,She is THE BEST!!!

"Yesterday::: President Worthen shared this video message to the BYU campus community.

As part of the message::: he emphasized the need to show loving::: genuine concern and respect for each other.

""This semester::: as we continue to take steps to prevent the spread of COVID-19::: we are again asking the BYU community to help protect and care for those around us.

""This is not a 'new normal.' Demonstrating 'a loving::: genuine concern for the welfare of our neighbor' is actually written into our BYU mission statement. It’s who we are.

""As scientific solutions to this global pandemic emerge::: we need to finish strong so that we can return to normal soon. May your 'normal' always include love and respect for one another. May we all stay safe and show kindness and compassion in this new year.""",1/6/2021 18:09,I wear a mask for me.. for my frontline hospital nurse daughter... for my wife that works with Seniors... and for my 89 year old Mom.. it’s a public health issue::: NOT politics...

It worked::: didn’t it?",Socialism doesn't want COVID-19 to go away. Wearing masks and social distancing have been only the introduction to Socialistic Law.

BUY is an LDS Private school designed to educate LDS kids apart for the evils of the world. You and your colleagues have open the gates to the filth of the world and are exposing our kids to immorality and destructive ideas. My son has already decided he will not even apply to BYU for his master and my grandchildren will not attend either.
We have visited Pat Robertson university::: Regent University::: and we found the Spirit to be stronger there than at BUY; that is because they don’t compromise the Gospel’s principles!
Shame on all of you for cowering to the demands of non members and a minority of emotionally disturbed members!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In accordance with Utah State Public Health Order 2020-27 and the Utah System of Higher Education COVID-19 Intensive Testing Plan::: Brigham Young University students 18 years or older who live in on-campus housing or attend at least one in-person or blended class are asked to take a COVID-19 screening test during the first ten days of winter semester. These students may also be invited to participate in focused and random testing throughout the semester if selected to do so.

Similar to the voluntary testing in November and December::: BYU will be administering these COVID-19 screening tests free of charge to students who are not experiencing any symptoms and haven’t tested positive in the last 90 days.

Entry testing will run Jan. 8–20 (excluding Sundays and the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday) in the Wilkinson Student Center Garden Court and in the Richards Building. Register for a testing time at byu.edu/coronavirus/student-covid-19-testing.

If you are experiencing symptoms within this testing period::: you can receive a test at the BYU Student Health Center which will be covered by your insurance or by BYU.

In addition to this initial entry testing::: BYU will continue to require face masks and use of the Healthy Together Passport app (or the digital or physical daily passport forms) in order to access certain on-campus services and facilities::: including the Harold B. Lee Library and devotionals and forums. These rules apply even if you’ve already had COVID-19.

g pandemic. For those who cannot support the school’s efforts::: I would suggest the state has many other fine universities. Please consider freeing up a seat for a student who wants to be at BYU. Attending BYU is a privilege::: not a right.",Awesome! Way to keep us safe::: thanks BYU!,Nice work::: Cougars. Thanks for working to protect vulnerable members of our wider community.,Thank you BYU for being proactive and offering testing free of charge!,Thank you BYU for helping to keep our community safe.,For an institution that values truth::: science::: and freedom::: you are failing in these efforts. And you’re failing those who are trying to get an education. You’re causing so much more damage to the health of students than then virus itself you’re trying to protect everyone from. Why are you engaging in the propaganda and supporting government usurpation of liberty? You’re absolutely going against true principles of health::: science::: reason::: Liberty::: and personal responsibility.,It sounds like it won’t be long before our church requires vaccines and proof via passport app. I wonder if this will roll out not just from the church’s schools but to temples and Sunday meetings as well... will be interesting! Glad this got posted on here::: grateful to stay updated.,Thanks BYU! This makes sense!,What happened to the weekly tests? Yikes! This is going backward::: not forward.,How about antibody testing especially for those who were positive but recovered with only minor or no symptoms???,"1. This is for all higher education institutions in Utah. 2. The rates on campus are crazy. I taught a class of just 11 students last semester (once a week on campus::: once a week on Zoom) and almost EVERY week had someone out on quarantine::: AND two of my students actually got Covid during the semester (and were pretty sick). Luckily not transmitted in our classroom.
I think it is good to get tested so that you don't have to quarantine as much.
Also I am glad there are some precautions::: as I requested to teach fully in person classes on campus this coming semester.",In most major universities::: students are being tested twice a week. Is anything like that being contemplated at BYU?,Dear readers of this thread::: if you do not see many comments in opposition to these mandates::: it's because BYU is actively deleting them.,I'm sad that the government and health department are taking away agency and not respecting our freedoms. It must be difficult to navigate this known that the state can just shut you down if you don't follow the health department guidelines. While I completely disagree with mandatory testing and masks I see the position you are in. Some classes really can't be fulfilled online only. I do hope all the universities will be more honest and forthright about what student educations might look like instead of allowing them to register for in person classes::: pay for tuition::: secure housing only to be locked in a dorm and all activities canceled when they could have stayed home for so much less or waited to take classes until they could be in person.,So what if the student tested positive over Christmas break. Do they need to show that to someone at BYU?,Are they still going to require weekly testing?,So what happens if BYU decides not to bow to the health department and decides not to test healthy people ?

People who does not experienced symptoms maybe asymptomatic (carriers) of the Covid-19!

I so wish I could have gone to the BYU library when I was in Utah in November.,FREE testing! But the supplies needed to do the testing don't come free.... SOMEONE has to pay for them. Are they being paid for with our tax dollars from our rich government that has an endless supply of money::: being 27 trillion dollars in debt and still having enough money to give more than 700 billion dollars to other countries.... or are they being paid for by the president of BYU::: using student tuition fees? Whichever one it is::: it will either help get our country more in debt and/or raise our taxes::: or it will raise the cost of student fees in the near future. And this is EXACTLY why getting FREE stuff through socialism will never work.... which is why prophets (God's mouthpieces) have spoken against socialism.,"So wait::: let me get this straight. The test is free if you DON'T have symptoms AND isn't free if you've ALREADY had the virus... ???

AND... (this is the best part)::: you STILL have to be tracked even if you've already had done with it.

Sounds like a solid plan...","What if they were tested as students move in—a non-symptomatic

Is that meaning they've already planned safety measures for the next seven years?,Are people in these comments not reading the beginning of the post stating BYU is OBEYING THE LAW? Why are people saying BYU is responsible for policies made by government? If you have a problem with it go write to your representative or post things on their pages.

Are you seriously saying::: ""papers please""? -\-\ Trust me::: you DO NOT want to be remembered alongside the other groups of people who said that. In case you're dense::: I'll give you a hint: they spoke German::: Russian::: and Mandarin.",What labs are you going to be allowing the tests to come from and how many cycles will they be running their PCR tests at? If you are going to require mandatory testing::: this is literally of the utmost importance so that you don't get heaping amounts of false positives! If the University is not asking these questions of the Laboratories that you are accepting test from::: you are not having an evidence-based protocol for your students and are not standing with science!,What if the student already beat Covid like a boss?,"@BYU I am literally astounded. I just read through the link you provided that you are using rapid antigen tests. Those have an INCREDIBLY great risk of false positives. This is directly from the FDA website:

""For example::: a test with 98% specificity would have a PPV of just over 80% in a population with 10% prevalence::: meaning 20 out of 100 positive results would be false positives.The same test would only have a PPV of approximately 30% in a population with 1% prevalence::: meaning 70 out of 100 positive results would be false positives. This means that::: in a population with 1% prevalence::: only 30% of individuals with positive test results actually have the disease.At 0.1% prevalence::: the PPV would only be 4%::: meaning that 96 out of 100 positive results would be false positives.""

"Utah Governor Gary Herbert declared a state of emergency and issued an executive order on November 8. In addition to other statewide restrictions and requirements::: the executive order requires weekly COVID-19 testing for college students who either live on campus or attend at least one in-person class per week. Each university campus is required to have a testing process in place by January 1::: 2021.

In an effort to rapidly implement large-scale COVID-19 screening testing for students on campus::: BYU has adopted the following three-part plan for the remainder of fall semester:

1. BYU will begin student COVID-19 screening tests November 18 through November 21.

2. COVID-19 screening tests are only for current students who are not experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 and have not tested positive for COVID-19 within the last 90 days. Students who are experiencing any symptoms of COVID-19 should get tested at the BYU Student Health Center or through another healthcare provider.

3. BYU non-student employees will not be part of the COVID-19 screening tests. Faculty and staff who wish to be tested can visit coronavirus.utah.gov for information on state testing locations.

Current BYU students may volunteer to participate in these screening tests. This information will give you the opportunity to make compassionate decisions that are best for yourself::: your family::: and your friends during the Thanksgiving holiday.

Testing will take place in the Wilkinson Student Center Garden Court this Wednesday through Saturday (Nov 18–21) by appointment only. These screening tests are a ""short-swab"" nasal test::: brushing 1 inch into your nostril. Test results will be available shortly after each test is administered.

After January 1::: 2021::: this testing will be mandatory for students living in on-campus housing and students taking at least one in-person class.

Thank you for your continued efforts to protect yourself::: your loved ones::: and our BYU community.

Student COVID-19 Testing",11/16/2020 22:41,Imagine being so privileged that the only oppression you ever felt is being asked to wear a mask and get tested to be allowed on campus.,With the virus spreading at other campuses::: I think that BYU is doing the right thing. I think that it’s for the greater good and students will feel much safer being on campus. I feel like people will always complain and they can’t separate politics from the virus.,"Why? Seriously for a flu with a recovery rate of 99.8%? Are hospitalization
s due to covid trending up? No! They arent! And false positive tests::: which there are MANY not to mention the tests where one nostril tests positive and the other negative?
BYU is SO concerned that all BYU gyms are still closed EXCEPT for anyone on a school team. (Is that not the epitome of hypocrisy?) All of which have been seen not wearing masks or social distancing! Gym access is part of tuition! Is there going to be reimbursement for those students NOT participating on a school team? The mandatory testing is another ridiculous overreach for what end? What is your end game? To have all classes online only? Online classes do NOT allow the same learning experience as IN person classes! I am sick of hearing ""if you dont want testing::: its your choice to live off campus"" BULL. BYU is turning out to be another crappy woke liberal thinking University! How sad for the LDS students.",The comments here make me question the value of my byu education. I just gave my weekly national covid briefing this afternoon. The correlation between states mask compliance and increasing rates of infection was striking. The exponential infection rate will be followed in 2 weeks by an exponentially increasing number of deaths. Low mask compliance can’t be fixed with a weekly test but it is a start and marginally better than nothing. It is astonishing to me to see Americans failing the basic Darwinian standard of self preservation. I don’t think it will sink in for some people until they lose people they love.,Thanks God::: I'm doing my program online::: perhaps the campus students should take precautions,BYU is becoming a joke.,"I would like the administration address the rationale of not having a few thousand fans at LES that holds 65:::000. We all know what the mandate is::: but what is the basis behind that edict? USU had more students at an indoor game this last week.

It's find to have rules::: but at least explain it to the fans.",Literally there’s been 2 vaccines announced y’all. Chill,We can't get him out fast enough,Seems to me that maybe they should have told us the truth. I don't believe anything they say anymore.,Sounds like a money maker for the Covid test companies. Someone should check to be sure no one is getting a kick back!,"I feel so sorry for the students at BYU. There are many students who are probably scared to say how they feel about this for fear they'll be thrown out of school for speaking out against university regulations. Hopefully they have the option to take the classes they need to from home if they don't want to do this.

Imagine being forced to be tested once a week to keep your job. Imagine being forced to be tested once a week or you're forced to move out of your community.

That's what these students are facing. How can the governor feel justified in this kind of discrimination?
How can he feel justified in creating this gross violation of rights?

Nobody should be forced to have tests done on their body if they don't want them done. Why are college students the ones being targeted by this kind of requirement? There are many other groups of people that could be contributing to the spread. This isn't right.",How thankful I am I am not a student. This is horrible,Great investment!!,With all this being said::: BYU needs to go 💯 online through January or longer if numbers keep rising. Most state schools are and you should follow suit.,I have 2 kids at BYU and they don’t know anyone who is sick. This mandatory testing is ridiculous. And then forced to isolate if positive even if no symptoms. I don’t trust the accuracy of the test. Sad they have to go through this. Feel like it’s just to drive up case numbers so then more govt control.,"The healthier you are::: the better your body will fight infection and disease. Boost your body’s immunity by carefully following the Lord’s Law of Health in Doctrine and Covenants 89. The promises are amazing...

“And all saints who remember to keep and do these sayings::: walking in obedience to the commandments::: shall receive health in their navel and marrow to their bones; And shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge::: even hidden treasures; And shall run and not be weary::: and shall walk and not faint. And I::: the Lord::: give unto them a promise::: that the destroying angel shall pass by them::: as the children of Israel::: and not slay them.”

The best way to avoid sickness and disease is to build your defenses!

tulGQmzkAIo",Thank you BYU!,"I have been stunned at the stubbornness and short-sightedne
ss in UT during the last few months. It's frankly alarming to me to see so many people who view emergency public health measures as equivalent to a communist takeover. When will you realize that these measures are about keeping vulnerable people safe? When will it start sinking in that this is not all about YOU::: but about all of us? Arizona has already had more than 6:::300 people die from this virus...how many deaths will it take for you to start taking this seriously? Just wear a mask.","From Yale Epidemiologist:::
Jonathan Smith: An important Covid Message

""As an infectious disease epidemiologist:::
at this point I feel morally obligated to provide some information on what we are seeing from a transmission dynamic perspective and how they apply to the social distancing measures.

Like any good scientist I have noticed two things that are either not being articulated or not present in the “literature” of social media.
I have also relied on my much smarter infectious disease epidemiologist friends for peer review of this post; any edits are from that peer review.

""Specifically::: I want to make two aspects of these measures very clear and unambiguous.

""First::: we are in the beginning of this epidemic’s trajectory. That means even with these distancing measures we will see cases and deaths continue to rise globally::: nationally::: and in our own communities in the coming weeks.

This may lead some people to think that the social distancing measures are not working. They are. They may feel futile. They aren’t. You will feel discouraged. You should. This is normal in chaos.

But this is normal epidemic trajectory. Stay calm. This enemy that we are facing is very good at what it does; we are not failing. We need everyone to hold the line as the epidemic inevitably gets worse.

""This is not my opinion; this is the unforgiving math of epidemics for which I and my colleagues have dedicated our lives to understanding with great nuance::: and this disease is no exception.

I want to help the community brace for this impact. Stay strong and with solidarity knowing with absolute certainty that what you are doing is saving lives::: even as people begin getting sick and dying. You may feel like giving in.

Don’t.

""Second::: although social distancing measures have been (at least temporarily) well-received::: there is an obvious-but-ove
rlooked phenomenon when considering groups (i.e. families) in transmission dynamics.

While social distancing decreases contact with members of society::: it typically increases your contacts with family members /very close friends.

This small and obvious fact has surprisingly profound implications on disease transmission dynamics.

Study after study demonstrates that even if there is only a little bit of connection between groups (i.e. social dinners::: playdates/
playgrounds::: etc.)::: the epidemic isn’t much different than if there was no measure in place.

The same underlying fundamentals of disease transmission apply::: and the result is that the community is left with all of the social and economic disruption but very little public health benefit.

""You should perceive your entire family to function as a single individual unit; if one person puts themselves at risk::: everyone in the unit is at risk. Seemingly small social chains get large and complex with alarming geometric speed.

If your son visits his girlfriend::: and you later sneak over for coffee with a neighbor::: your neighbor is now connected to the infected office worker that your son’s girlfriend’s mother shook hands with. This sounds silly::: it’s not. This is not a joke or a hypothetical.

We as epidemiologists
see it borne out in the data time and time again and no one listens. Conversely::: any break in that chain breaks disease transmission along that whole chain.

""In contrast to hand-washing and other personal measures::: social distancing measures are not about individuals::: they are about societies working in unison.
These measures also take a long time to see the results. It is hard (even for me) to conceptualize how on a population level::: ‘one quick little get together’ can undermine the entire framework of a public health intervention::: but it does.

I promise you it does. I promise. I promise. I promise.

""You can’t cheat it. People are already itching to cheat on the social distancing precautions just a “little”- a playdate::: a haircut::: or picking up a needless item at the store::: etc.

From a transmission dynamics standpoint::: this very quickly recreates a highly connected social network that undermines all of the work the community has done so far.

""Until we get a viable vaccine this unprecedented outbreak will not be overcome in one grand::: sweeping gesture::: rather only by the collection of individual choices our community makes in the coming months.

This virus is unforgiving to choices outside the rules.

""My goal in writing this is to prevent communities from getting ‘sucker-punched
’ by what the epidemiological
community knows will happen in the coming weeks.

It will be easy to be drawn to the idea that what we are doing isn’t working and become paralyzed by fear::: or to just 'cheat’ a little bit in the coming weeks.

By knowing what to expect::: and knowing the importance of maintaining these measures ::: my hope is to encourage continued community spirit::: strategizing::: and action to persevere in this time of uncertainty.""

“Today at Brigham Young University I shared a message about important issues of our day::: including overcoming racism. Personal attitudes and official practices of racism are not consistent with the revealed word of God. We know that God created all mortals and we are all children of God. The challenge of racism is not a new one::: but recent events have precipitated the current discussion.

“The shocking police-produced death of George Floyd in Minnesota last May was surely a trigger for nationwide protests in the United States::: whose momentum was carried forward under the message of ‘Black Lives Matter.’ Of course Black lives matter! That is an eternal truth all reasonable people should support.

“Dear friends::: let us all heed President Russell M. Nelson's call to repent::: to change::: and to improve. Only the gospel of Jesus Christ can unite and bring peace to people of all races and nationalities. We who believe in that gospel—whatever our origins—must unite in love of each other and of our Savior::: Jesus Christ.” —President Dallin H. Oaks

Artwork: used with permission from the artist Amber Eldredge",10/28/2020 2:14,To Heavenly Father and hopefully to all of us... every life matters.,I don’t like that Oaks commented on the Floyd death when there is no verdict yet and it may very likely be not police brutality at all! This goes against everything were taught about obeying laws of the land which states innocent until proven guilty! Also what is alarming is to hear him assume racism is a big problem right now when it statistically is not! When the church denied blacks priesthood there was racism but he didn’t remind us of the church’s mistakes with this in the past which was far more harmful! He also must not realize that mask wearing is a state issue and not a federal mandate! My state does not require masks::: yet the church has not respected my states law that allows mask wearing at church! The church has asked all states abide by the church mandate::: infringing on individual states rights! Sadly::: Oaks is out of touch and living in a bubble!,Today while I was in the check out line at Target::: there was a little black girl in front of me. She was so cute and precious! She made my day! There is beauty all around us::: if we just stop::: look and listen.,"In my ward::: I am the Relief Society president. For me and members of my diverse ward::: the BLM movement has been about asking tough questions about who gets heard::: about who is made uncomfortable or made to feel other when they come to church or activities::: about who gets callings. It has led to productive conversations and real steps forward. Our stake president has been asking the tough questions as well. We are learning to ask and listen. The civil rights movement took us some distance::: but there is progress to be made.

The BLM movement is about creating that change from wherever we are. I believe that we all need to do that work. I think of the scripture::: ""Wo be unto him that is at ease in Zion. Wo be unto him that crieth: All is well."" If we want to be like Jesus::: we have some soul searching to do. By looking for things we disagree with in the BLM movement::: we can miss the point-\-\sort of looking for the mote in someone else's eye when we have a beam in ours. Concerning ourselves only with rioting destruction::: is misguided. That destruction::: I believe::: can grow out of a sense of powerlessness and rage that comes from not being heard. I want to be one of the listeners. Destruction needs to stop::: but I'm not going to be the one tasked with tending to that. Consequently::: I don't want it to stop me from from paying attention to the things I can actually do something about.","If the title is so misleading why does President Oaks have it on his personal page. How dumb are people in the first place::: that they think that everyone who says::: “Black Lives Matter” are ONLY those who align with the organization that bears the same name? Why is it so darn hard to understand that we are referring to the sentiment and not an organization???
? Why does this ALWAYS need to be clarified??? Why? Because people with racism and racial bias can’t get with it. Point. Blank. Periodt.","You have to read the whole article to really understand that he is not endorsing blm. He is reminding us that the only way to really come together is to come closer to Christ. As His representative:::
he will always teach that.",Comment threads are such a revealing gauge of what people want to hear and what they've chosen to retain. Taking a close listen to President Oaks' remarks takes us away from the fringes and reactionary mindsets in which many of us have taken refuge::: and allows us to see that the 'sides' of our man-made culture war offer little of worth in the face of what the gospel of Jesus Christ offers us and instructs us to create - unity::: community::: equality::: family. Zion. He and others offered this counsel at our October General Conference. It's so disheartening to see to what lengths we will go to reject the words of our prophets. On the other hand::: having the dialogue::: challenging ourselves and each other to work past the ideas we have previously held is part of the process of conversion. Here's to those who are willing to take those steps.,is byu open or anyone know when it's opening back up again?,I don’t know why we are pretending that we are all racist. I’m tired of playing this divisive game::: and so should administrators at BYU. This is what creates racism in a previously post racial society.,Police produced::: or drug overdose?? We simply don't know yet. Maybe both.,"We all need to be very conscious of race relations and while we do need to look out for bad attitudes about minorities::: they need to stop the white shaming and blaming and insistance on the perjorative use of ""whiteness."" Love folks of all shades and colors and hope for the same in return.",With you on everything but George Floyd who died by proof of the coroners report withheld for some reason until later that proved he died of a self inflicted overdose of two drugs.,"I see that ""even the very elect shall be deceived""!",So we are at church point in history when we have to be told that racism is bad? Are we spiritually stupid? Anyone who has been taught anything about the Savior knows that treating some else wrongly for any reason is bad and therefore racism is wrong. When has that ever been in question? It is only in question now because of BLM outbursts::: which comes up ironically around election cycles. I wish the church leaders would address issues based off of our spiritual needs::: not based off of the demands of terrorist groups like BLM.,Black lives matter is a semantically overloaded statement. That semantic overload is 100% intentional. The BLM organization uses this inarguably true statement in order to drive semantic confusion and inevitable discord (as is evidenced within these comments). Elder Oaks is clearly referring to the statement::: and not the organization.,"What was the message BLM carried anti-police anti-religion anti-government
and hate for all the people they killed the church should not even mention them it’s embarrassing",This is obviously a political statement::: please don’t talk in the name of God or the Church. For God all lives matter::: asian ::: white::: black::: Latinos like me::: etc.,"First::: this post is misleading.....
.Pres Oaks never indicated a support for the movement of BLM...the organization is a blatant racist organization that is ant-Christian..
......Second::: racism is found in all races...affirma
tive action::: black only scholarships::: companies that hire a mandatory number of minorities::: all these things that our society deems as ""normal"" are all racist programs that promote one race over whites.....the only way to do away with racism is to quit treating people differently because of race.....no one should get preference over another::: it should all be merit based.",Most of us are guilty of selective obedience::: especially me.,"BLM is a socialist/
communist organization that wants to dismantle the family 😳😳",Whatever President Oaks intended::: these comments would aggrieve him. Is anyone echoing his message of relying on Christ? Christ calls for compassion::: and for loving our enemies-\-\even our political enemies. That's not what I'm reading in these comments. Let's be one in Christ because we certainly can't be one otherwise.,Do not construe that BLM is in anyway endorsed by The church if Jesus Christ of latter day saints.. the doctrine that all are alike unto God is true and is being addressed::: which is much different than supporting a violent self described Marxist organization of which one founder declared the traditional family a threat and has voiced destain for men marriage and parenthood particularly that fathers are not needed and females should not be encumbered with children but available to march and riot as directed for social justice... doctrine of all alike is eternal and true .. BLM is not,I’m so grateful for an apostle of God who has spoken out against racism in very clear terms. We would all do well to actually study and contemplate his words and begin the tough::: messy work of trying to create positive change that will come as we listen to our Black sisters and brothers.,🙄Don’t hate! Don’t murder!( Adults or babies). Dont lie! Don’t condone violence! These are all things we’ve been taught as important principles. Do not politicize what the prophet says. It’s a great. Reminder::: but nothing that as Christians we shouldn’t already know. In regards to our moral compass::: It doesn’t matter who is elected::: all the issues we are facing will only change as Americans search for kindness and goodness. Conodoning violent protests (no matter the reason) is not leading us in the right direction. 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄,I thought of positive comments for this quote coming from the apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ... But it seems that ideas are coming from different directions.. i think i need to apply the statement to myself because i myself admit that i am a judgmental person and needing to repent... thank you whoever post this statement because we need this to improve ourselves and to be what the Savior wants us to be...,I think you can beleive the church:::want police reform:::and not want racism while not supporting black lives matter.,"Horribly written summary of the speach. It gives the impression that President Oaks came out in support of the BLM movement. Couldn’t be more different than what he said when taken as a whole. I encourage everyone to read the full text.

Many believe it has done just that.,Floyd would not have died from the police’s actions if he did not have 4x the lethal limit of Fentanyl in his system. I know it’s hard to admit that a black person is responsible for their own actions and that all black hardships are not caused by white police.,I love what he said about wearing a mask!,Thank you BYU and sharing President Oaks’ words today.,A lot of people here with the incorrect assumption that the church will always stand in the same corner as American conservatism. Sad that your loyalty to a political side is more important than your commitment to following guidance from our prophets and apostles.,Jadzia Padilla imagine thinking BLM is a political statement and still refusing to accept the movement even when an apostle of God tells people that it's an eternal principal that should be lived.,All correct and when I stated this l got unfriended. No loss but there’s too many people that have their heads in the sand,Q Anon is rampant here......,I went to BYU. I read this article to find empathy::: compassion. However::: lots of comments here full of hatred. Judge not least you be judged.,Amazing to see people believe their dictator rather than general authorities.,It is ridiculous that church's university posted about politics and supporting on this a post a one candidate..,Blm eternal truth? Lol.,Wow. I hope didnt learn that at the Y,There is a difference between black lives matter and Black Lives Matter. One is clearly something we embrace. We are all children of God. The other is a Marxist movement that wants to destroy our form of government::: Western culture and the traditional family.,Black lives matter It is a criminal organization. Supported by Genocide George Soros.,So the person who put this article togeather did a very poor job woth the quotes. Elder Oaks never said George Floyd's deather was police produced. That was commentary by the writting and was not a quote. Be sure to pay attention to what is a quote and what is not. So i went back and reread the actual devotional and he did say that. I will say he is of a sound mind. And is not one to promote crazy lawlessness. And that he is human and allowed to make flaws.,Shame on you::: BYU for assuming someone acted with racist intent with zero evidence to back up that claim. Really sick of your PR team lately.,George Floyd’s death was not produced by the police it was a fentanyl overdose. Black lives matter is a Marxist communist group whose stated goals if you’d care to look them up are totally antithetical to the gospel and they have done nothing to help or benefit the lives of out brothers and sisters::: who just happen to have black skin. Stop promoting propaganda. Racism is and always has been evil and has always been used and promoted by the self-righteous.,Not true Douglas.,Im getting really sick of this. Im sure there is racism. White to black black to white and everyother race but it is not systematic and every white person is not rasist and every black person innocent,That art is awesome,I heard you exclude white people from your multicultural center is that true? If it is true is that racism? Would Jesus approve?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is an unprecedented season with so many unpredictables.
..BYU would take the best competition they could if the schedule allowed. They had a gauntlet of a schedule before this happened and though they might not be sitting at 6-0 and #12-#10 in the country::: nothing boosts confidence::: refines talent and fortifies a program more than winning football and winning BIG at that! These coaches and kids start believing they can beat anybody and they just might see it through! We have always been close to top 25 give or take a few seasons... let’s just enjoy the ride and see what happens!",Nice win!,Fun game!

"A shortage of N95 masks worldwide has led to important developments on campus with the Nanos Foundation. Undergraduate students from BYU's Sensors and Applied Biomechanics Engineering Laboratories helped develop a way to turn a regular cloth mask into an N95 mask.

Using a process called electrospinning::: student researchers create membranes comprised of trillions of nanofibers that trap particles—including viruses. These nanofiber membranes within a regular cloth mask provide the same filtration as an N95 mask.",10/20/2020 15:29,"""When Should a Mask Be Used?

Face masks should be used only by individuals who have symptoms of a respiratory infection such as coughing::: sneezing::: or::: in some cases::: fever. Face masks should also be worn by health care workers::: by individuals who are taking care of or are in close contact with people who have respiratory infections::: or otherwise as directed by a doctor.

"In response to recent COVID-19 trends in our county::: the following joint letter was sent this morning to all BYU and UVU students from President Worthen and President Tuminez:

Dear Students:::

As the presidents of the two largest universities in the state of Utah::: we are grateful that we have been able to open our student facilities and offer face-to-face classes this fall semester. We thank those who have been compliant with the safety guidelines that have been put in place due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

However::: we are greatly concerned about the dramatic rise in positive cases of COVID-19 in Utah County::: particularly among college students. This is both alarming and unacceptable.

We’re concerned not only for your well-being::: but also those in the local community who are affected by the trends we’ve seen in the last week.

Behavior must change. We implore you to stay home except for in-person classes::: work::: church::: and other essentials. We ask that you limit your social interactions to only those within your household and avoid small gatherings where individuals aren’t wearing masks or maintaining physical distance. If you’re feeling sick::: stay home. If you've had a known exposure to the virus::: may test positive for the virus or are awaiting a test result::: follow the quarantine guidelines of state and local health officials. We expect you to follow all safety requirements on campus and all state and local mandates off campus.

If circumstances do not improve within the next two weeks::: more dramatic action will be necessary. This may include a two-week quarantine::: closing campuses to the public or a complete retreat to all-remote instruction for the rest of the semester.

Please be wise. Your individual choices will make all the difference.

Sincerely:::

Kevin J Worthen::: BYU President
Astrid S. Tuminez::: UVU President",9/22/2020 16:53,Faith over fear! What happened to living by gospel principles? BYU has sold out long ago. Yuck.,I'm surprised at how many people get all ruffled by something as simple as this. They're just asking the students to help out in this situation. Wearing masks and social distancing isn't that hard. None of us like it but it's the charitable thing to do right now. They are the main tools we have to fight this and help us get back to normal::: which we all want! So maybe try to set your grievances aside and do what's best for the common good!,"I am shocked at this statement. It is so condemning and full of blame. Germs are not going away. Colds are not going away. This statement blames college students for coughs and colds. There has been and will be coughs and colds and sickness and death. Staying home for part of the day or putting on a mask will not stop colds not viruses from affecting humans. This year nor next year nor the next year::: bacteria and viruses will still affect humans by causing sickness especially to weakened immune systems. Telling the young people to get more sleep::: eat more fruits and vegetables::: drink more water::: and to eat much less junk food would have a better affect on their health than telling them to isolate themselves and create more loneliness and fear.

Please please don’t blame the students for coughs and colds and fall viruses. Let’s support them in healthy socializing and normal social living. No blame only truth in science and in health.",Thank you::: BYU! This is so important. I’ve been really impressed by how campus has mitigated the spread so hopefully we students can do our part!,Such a rude::: demeaning::: power hungry letter. Too bad leaders like these have such need to stroke their egos to fulfill their need to feel all powerful.,I love how the president of BYU and UVU came together and posted this announcement as a team 🥰,Keep it in perspective. What are the risks to these healthy young people. UNLOCK THE STATE AND HER PEOPLE. LET FREEDOM RING.,Thank you::: BYU for taking this seriously. I can’t imagine my freshman year with out all the random socializing and huge get togethers::: but this is the reality of 2020. It’s so disappointing and embarrassing to see members of our alumni::: most from my own church::: disregard science and the lives of other people.,"""We ask that you limit your social interactions to only those within your household and avoid small gatherings where individuals aren’t wearing masks or maintaining physical distance."" This doesn't resonate with college students. Provide alternative activities.",All the self-appointed FB doctors to the rescue!! Some of these responses are so alarming. I’m *really* hoping most of them aren’t current BYU students or alum but just disgruntled U of U fans trolling the BYU Facebook page. 😂,It has never been a practice to quarantine the healthy. Those high risk should quarantine themselves. Let the rest of humanity get on with our lives and businesses and school and back to normal! The mental::: emotional::: and financial cost of this insane lockdown has far outweighed the risks. The six month anniversary of the two week flatten the curve has gone long enough. We flattened the curve! This isn't gonna go away. We are all going to get it eventually. In the meantime::: let's be more concerned about the businesses that have and will cease to exist. The travel industry::: the hotel industry::: the bowling alleys::: the hair salons::: the corn mazes! Enough is enough! I'm disgusted that my Alma Mater is shaming their students including one of my own. Shame on BYU for bending to the pressure and ignoring the actual Utah data. (i.e.::: 92% of deaths are high risk::: 73 is the average age of death::: over 72% who died are over 65 yrs old).,Does everyone realize that the current campus case count is 400 active which is 0.93% of the campus community? The total reported INCLUDING those who have recover is 927 which is only 2.2% of the campus community. So please explain to me why are we causing everyone to freak out?,Provo and Orem is going from yellow stage of recovery back to orange starting Wednesday. Follow the rules and we will go back to yellow. Masks are also mandatory starting Wednesday.,A rise in cases... but not a rise in DEATHS. This has become a common cold. The common cold is a coronovirus::: so if you get a free test that they are handing out like candy (hence a “rise” in cases)::: then you will test positive for “Covid” even if you don’t have it. This is the first health crisis to cause fear and shut down our economy based off of CASES and not DEATHS. Let people live their lives. If you are afraid or high risk::: then stay home::: but the rest of us would like to get back to the REAL normal.,If BYU goes totally remote::: my husband won't be able to finish his incredibly important video projects. Getting a job in the advertising industry is highly determined by your portfolio. Moving all studies online won't allow him to finish up the projects planned for this year. So::: PLEASE PLEASE wear a mask!,I can see how a young student can have the mindset that since it won't affect them it is all a big over-reaction. It's hard to see how it can affect other people. Glad BYU and UVU are on the same page about this and are trying very hard to stay open for in person classes but are being so careful about it. You can still have fun at college while following these guidelines.,"The goal is to reduce the curve::: correct? Not to necessarily prevent everyone to exposure. Are these cases leading to hospitalization
s? Tell us the all the facts not just positive results. Positive results without hospitalization
s could be a good thing as we get closer to herd immunity. Don’t just play the scare game- give us the facts. We already have one Fauci::: we don’t need another...",Lollll how do you expect students to follow the rules when members of the administration don’t???,I love BYU. But have we ever been “greatly concerned” about a rise in flu cases in years where the flu was going around? I doubt it. The students are more at risk of danger crossing the street on 9th East with crazy drivers or sledding at an FHE activity than they are from the Covid flu.,Based on the comments here from students::: it seems both BYU and UVU are failing in educating their students with a proper understanding of basic biology::: statistics::: and the difference between legitimate sources of information and biased media.,"Please make this the last chance. We in the community don’t want to continue to suffer for the students selfishness or the administration’
s inability to hold them accountable/
take necessary action in the face of their recklessness.",Thank you for the warning and the reminder.

There's a reason college kids go to brick and mortar schools. It's so they can meet and be with other people their own age. If it wasn't for that motivation everyone would be doing online school.

She has tried for three days to be tested but the testing center tells her she can't afford it. What??? She has great insurance that will cover it::: and if not::: I will cover the cost::: so I don't understand why students who have symptoms and have been exposed are not able to have testing done. I have put a call into the state health office::: but honestly::: this frustrates me. I have also had friends post about their kids who are in the quarantined dorms unable to get food::: even those on food plans. ? I think BYU needs to form a plan and stick with a good one. First and foremost::: open testing to students (free in the state of Utah) so those testing positive willl stop spreading it to others. Maddening.,Those who are at risk should be free to stay home until the pandemic has passed. (Hint: Current stats suggest this has already happened.) Holding young people responsible for the mortality of their grandparents is cruel::: cowardly and scientifically indefensible.,Thank you! Students need to consider the consequences of their choices on the greater community. They can greatly impact the spread of COVID-19 in the community benefiting their vulnerable neighbors. I fully support BYU taking disciplinary action against individual students disregarding guidelines::: as well as implementing wider campus restrictions.,Honestly::: I’m surprised that BYU is reacting like this when there are a little over 12:::000 active cases total in the ENTIRE state,Why is the campus still open?...

I refuse to allow my BYU student to use my phone for this anti-freedom APP. I also am so disappointed in the random COVID testing and Mask mandates.

Right? I don't like to say this::: but I think the BYU administration was ""alarmingly"" negligent in being so open and non-chalant about students returning to campus.

This is a serious issue that needs to be dealt with!,I am very concerned by the delayed response of BYU in handling COVID-19 as they’ve reopened for fall. There are many other colleges that have shown a better response to support students who become ill::: contact tracing::: etc. Require compliance with masks and social distancing rather than just suggesting it. This is some progress but it almost feels like too little too late BYU. 😬,"It is sadly apparent from many of the responses to this post::: widespread misunderstandin
g and ignorance continue to abound. No wonder the numbers continue to rise. Proud of the universities for being proactive and protective of the community.",My son tested positive for Covid last week. He has firmly adhered to guidelines and doesn’t know where he picked it up from. His 3 room mates who weren’t as strict about wearing masks and not gathering all tested negative. The biggest issue is that BYU doesn’t have a firm plan in place and isn’t responding quickly enough to what is happening. My son was finally isolated 24 hours after his test came back::: and it took another 50 plus hours after that for his case worker to finally contact him. Luckily::: he had already texted everyone that he had had been into contact. Some people chose to get tested and others didn’t. He can only pass along the information. The other issue I see is just how difficult going into isolation is. These kids often feel sick and are placed in a situation in which they are entirely alone. It was stressful figuring out meals and how best to support him from afar. I think this needs to be better handled. My son felt a complete lack of compassion and I felt that he had been totally left alone and that he had no one checking in on him (until he received a call from his case worker 3 days later) and this is unacceptable. I understand that they are adults::: but I also believe that BYU has a responsibility try to take care of them. I worry that this may be preventing kids from being tested who probably should be. Without testing we can’t monitor or understand the way this virus is working.,Sounds like something's wrong with Utah County lol,Your colleges and have no power to tell people how to live their life’s if you’re really that scared and worried about it then close your schools but y’all won’t do that cause you want our money so shut up and teach the stupid classes and stay out of peoples personal life’s or put your money where your mouth is and close your schools and refund people...,Thank you byu for getting together with uvu and addressing the students like this.

Never again will these students have so many cultural and social resources at their disposal and the ability in their lives to partake. Never again will they have the perfect set of life circumstances that allow a building of peer to peer relationships::: relationships that can last a lifetime. The ends here do not seem to justify the means.",So they couldn't get racial segregation::: anyone want to bet on whether there will be mask segregation?,"https://

I know Thomas wouldn’t go to these parties::: but who had that he may have come in contact with. I have heard that there are battles between Orem and Provo and mayors and city councils about wearing masks. You are right that they have not taken care of the students as they should. The prophet said to wear masks::: they should not fight about whether to follow the guidelines or not.","This is insane. There is no clear goal to the end of mask wearing. If you’re trying to make Covid at ZERO cases::: that’s impossible. People aren’t gonna wear masks in their living quarters. As a student::: I think it’s ridiculous to ask us to mask up and stay inside for a time period that seems to never end. We’ve had our lives on hold since FEB. it’s extremely depressing::: and deteriorating on mental health. We can’t keep doing this month after month after month. (Over a flu!) Everyone is acting like this is some sort of mid evil Bubonic plague that’s killing tons of people. It’s not. Go ahead and put school online. (All my classes have been online at BYU since day 1.) People are still going to go hang out with their friends masks or not. You can’t ask people to have zero socialization::: it’s part of a human fundamental needs.
When school is online for everybody::: they are still going to go socialize::: no matter how much you try to force control.

EVERYONE that is saying “they are young and selfish” would do the exact SAME thing if you weren’t 40 with kids and no social needs.

You can’t just put your entire life on hold indefinitely and sit home and stare at your fridge.
Suicide is at an all time high from this “pandemic”. I think students and lots of other non-students realize that there’s a point where you draw the line and need to move on. It’s causing way more devastation from economic disaster than it is killing the infected.","I am extremely disheartened by many of the comments in this post. It saddens me to know that so many alumni and students are so unsympathetic and unChristlike. I would expect the majority of those connected to BYU to show Christlike compassion to the high-risk in our communities and to bear the burdens of our neighbors.

This is an incredibly difficult time::: nobody is forgetting that. Job insecurity and the loss of social interaction are both major issues. However::: nothing is more important than securing the health and safety of our state and I appreciate BYU and UVU taking a moment to remind their communities of the importance of showing compassion towards one another by social distancing::: wearing a mask::: and avoiding unnecessary gatherings.",Rachael Monson-Bishop,Aven Layton,What a load of crap BYU! EMBARRASSED that I attended and graduated from this university lromlting false informations and COVID hysteria. What a load!🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️,Jordan Meyer,Mary Beth Lea Tolman,"🛑 Stop the hysteria. According to the CDC:

• 0.003% of children 18 and younger who are infected with coronavirus die.
• The fatality rate is 0.02% of people aged 20 to 49.
• 0.5% of people aged 50 to 69.

Even though half the world now knows that the majority of those test results are false positives. And PCR tests aren't even supposed to be used for covid. But that's beside the point.

The real question is... what is the percentage of deaths? This virus has a 99.8% survival rate.

2 weeks to flatten the curve has turned into 6 months of businesses lost::: loneliness::: mandates::: depression & anxiety::: fear::: losing human connection::: suicide::: and giving up freedom.

What's next?? This is truly UNBELIEVABLE.

PLEASE!",Jacob Siaosi,Eleah Coral,Marisa Gonzalez,Irving Castillo,Do we think it’s just going to magically disappear if we stay away from eachother for long enough? Let it run its course.

Simple word of wisdom stuff we seem to have forgotten.,"BYU can you address the ""Covid surveillance testing"" you are requiring? If a student misses their mandatory time they are automatically counted positive and have to quarantine for 14 days.

Isn't it grossly irresponsible to run a program that way?","How many of us are living in FEAR::: and yet God has given us more tools than we can even comprehend. WHY ARE WE TRUSTING IN THE ARM OF FLESH???

“40 And there were some who died with fevers::: which at some seasons of the year were very frequent in the land—but not so much so with fevers::: because of the excellent qualities of the many plants and roots which God had prepared to *REMOVE the CAUSE* of diseases...” Alma 46:40

“10 And again::: verily I say unto you::: all wholesome herbs God hath ordained for the constitution::: nature::: and use of man—
11 Every herb in the season thereof::: and every fruit in the season thereof; all these to be used with prudence and thanksgiving.”

“18 And all saints who remember to keep and do these sayings::: walking in obedience to the commandments::: shall receive health in their navel and marrow to their bones;
19 And shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge::: even hidden treasures;
20 And shall run and not be weary::: and shall walk and not faint.
21 And I::: the Lord::: give unto them a promise::: that the destroying angel shall pass by them::: as the children of Israel::: and not slay them. Amen.”

2 Timothy 1:7
“For God hath not given us the spirit of fear ; but of power ::: and of love ::: and of a sound mind.”",I really wish people would understand the ridiculous PCR test! These “case numbers” are absolutely meaningless. The test was never intended to be used as a diagnostic tool and it was created almost 2 decades ago! There is no COVID-19 test! Care about truth!,"Wow what threatening language!!! BYU is allopathic spreading the dogma and fear. Wearing a mask is involved in many satanic rituals::: the glory of god is shown in our faces....

How disappointing! Just because cases rise doesn’t mean deaths do. More cases and low death rate mean herd immunity is happening!!! This is a good thing despite popular belief.","Herd immunity. That's how you eradicate a virus. Let people contract it and recover::: or die. Just like with the other thousand contagious diseases floating around. Can't shut down society for every single one of them::: because we'd be letting fear of a natural thingcontrol us.

{Public Health major}","Pres. Oaks...

“It’s evident that scientists and public health workers and political leaders have struggled with incomplete knowledge of what to do and say and require::: and when they have pretended to have more knowledge than they have::: they have fallen short.”",The students are being randomly tested daily. The rest of the population in Provo is not being tested. Most of the students are following the rules just as most of the population in Provo is following the rules. If they quit testing::: the changes would not be made. The college kids are the scapegoat for the higher numbers in Provo when in all reality they are the only ones being tested. I see kids all over campus and around it wearing masks outside (which is not required). For the most part::: they are doing an excellent job in the situation. Hang in there students! 💙,"I agree with Oxford's head of Evidence Based Medicine::: Prof. Carl Heneghan::: lockdowns are not the answer and we have to learn to live with this. It's never going to be eradicated. Spanish Flu hits us every year. It never left. These viruses never really appeared. They just jumped species. Imagine if regular influenza had not made the jump to humans until 2020 and we suddenly had 50:::000 excess deaths. We'd be locking down. But hindsight tells us we can live with it::: and viruses resulting in higher deaths because they're more contagious::: not because they're more intrinsically fatal. The scientists at schools like Oxford and Imperial College preached herd immunity from the beginning. They ultimately gave into the political backlash because people are uncomfortable with the idea::: and it will cost politicians their jobs. These same scientists are still saying we need the younger population to be exposed to this::: as a long term approach::: not a short term bandaid which lockdown is. We can't live in fear. This meme was making the rounds back in March::: but we seem to have forgotten - Per CS Lewis:::

In one way we think a great deal too much of the atomic bomb. “How are we to live in an atomic age?” I am tempted to reply: “Why::: as you would have lived in the sixteenth century when the plague visited London almost every year::: or as you would have lived in a Viking age when raiders from Scandinavia might land and cut your throat any night; or indeed::: as you are already living in an age of cancer::: an age of syphilis::: an age of paralysis::: an age of air raids::: an age of railway accidents::: an age of motor accidents.”

In other words::: do not let us begin by exaggerating the novelty of our situation. Believe me::: dear sir or madam::: you and all whom you love were already sentenced to death before the atomic bomb was invented: and quite a high percentage of us were going to die in unpleasant ways. We had::: indeed::: one very great advantage over our ancestors—anest
hetics; but we have that still. It is perfectly ridiculous to go about whimpering and drawing long faces because the scientists have added one more chance of painful and premature death to a world which already bristled with such chances and in which death itself was not a chance at all::: but a certainty.

This is the first point to be made: and the first action to be taken is to pull ourselves together. If we are all going to be destroyed by an atomic bomb::: let that bomb when it comes find us doing sensible and human things—praying:::
working::: teaching::: reading::: listening to music::: bathing the children::: playing tennis::: chatting to our friends over a pint and a game of darts—not huddled together like frightened sheep and thinking about bombs. They may break our bodies (a microbe can do that) but they need not dominate our minds.

— “On Living in an Atomic Age” (1948)","People do not think about this:
If the area under a flattened curve is much the same... What is the point?
(I know::: it was to keep hospitals from being overwhelmed. They have had time to assess and prepare::: and outside of NY they never got close to capacity. Relative to last year::: medical facilities are ghost towns with people avoiding or postponing non-covid matters.)
The relatively small amount of human suffering and death that come from this virus are not reduced by austere enforcements::: it's just dragged out over months (and years?)

Those at extreme risk (nursing home residents and staff::: chemo patients::: ect) should be the only ones quarantining (and they should be very strick about it).

All others::: especially young healthy college students::: should be living their lives and building the population's herd immunity. This is nature's vaccine if you will. A developed vaccine is going to take a while.

Look at Sweden: they did it right and they've had no 'second wave' like the US and elsewhere in europe. It's nearly over for them and their communities are intact.

Also::: even if on-campus students do their best::: you've got 6 or so students living together::: and each spends time with a different circle of classmates and co-workers. That is a recipe for virus spread even with masks. Regardless::: social interaction is important for humans. No need to be hard on students.

'2 weeks' became 'a few months'::: and will that become 'a few years'? You would never swear off driving because of the risk of death... Because you assess the benefits of transportation to be greater than the cost. We need to seriously reassess what an appropriate response looks like.

We have forgone the benefits of timely treatment for other medical issues::: quality education - especially for children::: healthy local economies with local businesses - in effect your neighbor's livelihood::: social interaction important for mental health::: ect. This will bring some decline in quality of life::: and some poverty::: which are predictors of shorter lifespans. Human life years are very possibly being lost::: but no one considers this as the effects are well-distribute
d.","Just a question for the people who won’t wear masks or socially distance: can I be allowed to refuse to provide medical treatment for you if you catch Covid?

I love how people here throw out statistics about Covid and act as if they know what they’re talking about and our state epidemiologists
and university health officials have no clue about what is going on. I highly doubt many of these commentators have even studied statistics or read a scientific paper before.",Booooooo.... live your life people! Your risk profile is LOW!,If you look at the number of positive cases at BYU compared to the number of enrolled students::: the number is actually very low. (My Daughter received an email saying it was approximately 450 cases if I remember correctly)Some increase in positive cases should be expected when you bring students from all over the country together. I don’t think the increasing numbers are due to “partying” or being irresponsible I think it’s just a mere matter of putting that many new people together who haven’t been around each other before i.e. new roommates living together etc. New roommates are not going to be wearing a mask around one another and if you’re asymptomatic you’re not going to know that you have Covid and possibly pass it to a roommate. I’m not saying some students weren’t being careless::: I’m just saying things need to be kept in perspective when it comes to percentage rates of people testing positive. When I went on campus with my daughter a few weeks ago everyone was wearing a mask and doing their best as I imagine most students are.,Hmm basically saying going to work is okay::: but being consumers and helping businesses survive isn't... so stop going out and contributing to the economy so we can further increase the unemployment percentage for when we all graduate. Got it!,Tyranny rears its ugly head again::: even in Utah County. So sad.,"Cases.... but there's no evidence that supports how many cases are 'sick' and how many are completely healthy (getting force tested but absolutely zero symptoms)

When at people going to wake up and fight back","To everyone saying ""how many deaths"" or ""there's a 99.7% survival rate""as an argument to reopen campus::: if all 43:::000 people at BYU::: roughly 100 (give or take) people will die. Which people in the BYU community should die so we can full open and stay open? In addition to that::: yes::: there is a 99.7% survival rate::: but how many people develop long term conditions from COVID? I know I did::: I now require an inhaler to walk to campus. I know countless other people my age did. But hey::: let's disregard science and fully reopen so 100 people can die and thousands develop long term conditions.",Whose deleting the comments? I've tried to like 3 comments but they were no longer available for comment. Were they deleted by the admin? Are we being censored?,"If masks work::: why the distance? If masks and distance work::: then why the continue in cases? Why are we not being told the end goal? Why are we only hearing bad things and things to scare us from the media? Why can thousands protest but 100 can’t watch a high school football game? I believe there are many false priests who oppress and wolves in sheep’s clothing among our government. We’re all just political pawns and the miracle vaccine will save us in November (Yes vaccine is scheduled to be ready by November::: what a coincidence!)

If you’re scared of COVID::: stay home. If you’re not::: go live your life and enjoy it. We don’t put the world on hold for strep::: the flu::: and so many other virus that kill thousands each year::: why is this different? Oh yeah because it’s an election year..

Do you remember when this all started? The roads were dead::: people were rarely outside. Playgrounds and even lakes were shut down. Yet the numbers kept rising somehow. We were ordered to wear masks and stay away.. 95% complied and the numbers still went up. We finally started getting things under control when guess what.. we were told “ COVID is spread by asymptotic people! but a symptomatic people can’t get tested because it will come back negative” In Michigan we were told to flatten the curve. Which we did in 14 days::: but the governor continued to restrict (she even said we couldn’t use boats with an engine on the lake::: row boats were fine though). Yet cases keep rising. Everyone in public has a mask on::: everyone is doing a pretty good job at standing on their colored lines like there getting ready for school recess. We’re being fed lies and miss lead. Wolves in sheep’s clothing are among us.","Maybe we should stick to common sense and listen to what intelligent medical experts (who have no skin in the game) advise.

T_rwHj8I","It’s the administrations
’ job to create guidelines that have a chance of reaching their goal (reasonable Covid incidence rates). It’s the students responsibility to adhere to those guidelines and support the goal behind them (all students had to agree to this one paper) else face discipline personally or global repercussions in the form of the warnings found in this memo (stricter guidelines). It’s pretty simple. They’re just saying that::: so far::: the guidelines haven’t worked so they may need to be changed.
If the problem really is that a significant portion of students aren’t following the guidelines (just can’t make it through a year without parties and tunnel singing) then they have a chance to do better or else have an even worse college experience.
If the problem is with the guidelines themselves (in other words::: if the virus has spread despite reasonable attempts at social distancing for at campus classes::: mask wearing and random tests) then the guidelines still need to be changed to meet the goal of reasonable Covid incidence rates.

A whole separate conversation is whether their definition of reasonable Covid incidence rate is::: in fact::: “reasonable”😆",No one should ever get tested unless you are deathly ill and need to go to the hospital::: and you should never tell if you are around someone that has tested!! If people would just stop this crazy testing !!! I’m in the medical field. Those tests we give people are not a covid 19 test. It is a generic covid. We’ve all had a covid virus before!!! A covid 19 test can only be determined by blood and we only give those once you’re admitted to the hospital. So those daily numbers..... they are mostly just the regular flu and colds!!! A positive result does not mean you have covid 19!!! But.... they do get quite a bit of money for every positive test!,"I don’t know if I agree that the kids are scapegoats. We live directly among them. There are at least twice weekly large75-100 kids getting together in our neighborhood. Nary a mask in site.

I believe many of them are making good choices. Unfortunately many are not","I have a few legitimate questions. I hope that a few of you or maybe even the University leaders can provide legitimate answers. Based on the ""New"" Orange level Covid guidelines sent out by BYU University Communications one of the new restrictions pertains to all on campus recreational facilities Gyms::: Pools and such are all included in the following: • ""All campus recreational facilities will be closed except for use by approved groups::: including academic classes."" What exactly are ""approved groups?"" Are these ""approved groups"" the schools sports teams? Since The football team has been seen practicing and the pool team just this morning was seen at the pool::: all close together::: certainly NOT social distancing at all::: I am assuming the answer to that is a ""Yes::: No one EXCEPT those who belong to a school team may use the Gyms ect..."" Next question: Since these are newly listed COVID restrictions::: Why are only team members allowed to use the Gyms and other recreational facilities? Has it been proven by the school that team members don't contract covid or don't test positive for covid but the rest of the student population is responsible for all of the new cases of late? Isn't that blatant discrimination of the majority of the student body who DONT participate on a school team? Another question. The majority of students in a dorm on campus::: are taking mostly zoom classes with very little in person classroom experiences. Everyone knows how tiny these dorms are and with 6 people in each it must be difficult to find space for every ""Zoom"" class. There is a huge ""activity room"" in each dorm. Students WERE using this room as a quiet place to go to for their Zoom classes but now that the ""New"" Orange Level Covid guidelines were issues those rooms are locked to students to use to study and watch zoom classes. Are these activity rooms also closed only to the general student population but open to students who participate on a team? (sarc) Why are these huge rooms closed to students who simply want a quiet place to watch their zoom classes. How in the world is locking thise room in each dorm to those that want to study::: helping keep the spread of covid down when there is never more than 2 students in one of these huge rooms at a time? Asking for a friend.","Yeah::: staying at home will stop a respiratory virus from spreading. That's why the flu virus goes away during the colder months when everyone is forced to stay inside... 🤥🤥🤥🤪🤪🤪

Wow! I expected this kind of stupidity from YBU::: but I'm surprised UVU stuck their heads up their butts::: too. Fascist idiots.",Sounds like a threat::: is it not? Sounds like coercion::: is it not? Aren't you aware we live in a Republic where we are SELF governed? It sounds like you're trying to assert authority that you do not have::: is that correct? You're asserting that you have the power over people's bodies::: but that side steps the law of creation does it not? You get government funding no?,"Yeah::: I see people at my apartment complex just hanging out or doing activities without masks. I suppose a germaphobic introvert like myself doesn’t face the risk that people who attend these activities do::: but I can only avoid such germs as long as the virus doesn’t get in my apartment of 6.

Honestly::: I kind of wish they had just done fall semester online. I understand that this makes it hard for certain majors to get things done::: but if the school needs to go to online anyway::: it could have saved hundreds of people the troubles associated with getting the virus.","What a moron. Seriously::: just change the ""COVID-19"" for any other benign sickness and the letter's ridiculousness becomes apparent to all.","If you're afraid of COVID-19 just wait until the vaccine comes out::: it has the potential of being far worse than anyone can imagine.

Message from Robert F. Kennedy::: Jr.
""To all my patients:
I would like to draw your attention urgently to important issues related to the next Covid-19 vaccination. For the first time in the history of vaccination::: the so-called last generation mRNA vaccines intervene directly in the genetic material of the patient and therefore alter the individual genetic material::: which represents the genetic manipulation::: something that was already forbidden and until then considered criminal. This intervention can be compared to genetically manipulated food::: which is also highly controversial. Even if the media and politicians currently trivialize the problem and even stupidly call for a new type of vaccine to return to normality::: this vaccination is problematic in terms of health::: morality and ethics::: and also in terms of genetic damage that::: unlike the damage caused by previous vaccines::: will be irreversible and irreparable.
Dear patients::: after an unprecedented mRNA vaccine::: you will no longer be able to treat the vaccine symptoms in a complementary way. They will have to live with the consequences::: because they can no longer be cured simply by removing toxins from the human body::: just as a person with a genetic defect like Down syndrome::: Klinefelter syndrome::: Turner syndrome::: genetic cardiac arrest::: hemophilia::: cystic fibrosis::: Rett syndrome::: etc.)::: because the genetic defect is forever!
This means clearly: if a vaccination symptom develops after an mRNA vaccination::: neither I nor any other therapist can help you::: because the damage caused by the vaccination will be genetically irreversible. In my opinion::: these new vaccines represent a crime against humanity that has never been committed in such a big way in history. As Dr. Wolfgang Wodarg::: an experienced doctor::: said: In fact::: this ""promising vaccine"" for the vast majority of people should be FORBIDDEN::: because it is genetic manipulation! ""
The vaccine::: developed and endorsed by Anthony Fauci and funded by Bill Gates::: uses experimental mRNA technology. Three of the 15 human guinea pigs (20%) experienced a ""serious adverse event"".
...
Note: messenger RNA or mRNA is the ribonucleic acid that transfers the genetic code of the DNA of the cell nucleus to a ribosome in the cytoplasm::: that is::: the one that determines the order in which the amino acids of a protein bind and act as a mold or pattern for the synthesis of that protein.

Vaccine COVID = IRREVERSIBLE GENETIC DAMAGE - A CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY.
[25/08 6:05 p. m.] +58 414-0750240: SCHOOLING FOR THE POPULATION TO BE NO MORE ENGAGED:
DOES CORONAVIRUS EXIST OR NOT?
- CLARIFICATION:
1. DOES THE VIRUS EXIST?
Yes::: like many other viruses.
2. DOES IT HAVE A CURE?
Yes::: if you use the proper medicines and do not leave your health in the hands of corrupt and mercantile health systems.
3. ARE THERE GOOD DOCTORS?
Yes and many::: some are acting discreetly giving appropriate treatments::: others have been bolder and there are many videos in the networks talking about these treatments::: and many have been threatened::: disqualified or silenced.
4. ARE SCIENTISTS INVESTIGATING?
Yes::: and there is a world union calling for more doctors and scientists called Doctors and Scientists for Truth::: to expose the falsity of the treatment they have given to the bug issue.
5. IS IT A PANDEMIC?
No. The WHO changed the term that referred to the pandemic::: before the bug was launched in order to end the pandemic.
6. IS IT CONTAGIOUS?
Yes::: like all flu.
7. IF I CATCH THE VIRUS::: DOES IT MEAN THAT I WILL DIE?
No. If you have symptoms::: just take the appropriate medicine from the first day (strengthen the immune system::: take anti-inflammato
ry and anti-influenza)
and cure yourself at home.
8. CAN IT BE PREVENTED?
Yes::: being as clean as you should be::: and maintaining a high immune system. And you also have: Ozone Therapy::: Chlorine Dioxide with the preventive protocol.
9. ARE THE COUNT OF INFECTED AND DEAD BY THE VIRUS CERTAIN?
No. In the USA it was discovered that any data::: would be in fact 10% of that number::: because the causes of deaths were other diseases::: and the tests are not reliable::: they give false positives.
10. ARE ASYMPTOMATIC REAL CASES OF POSITIVES?
The human being has many microorganisms and viruses in the body and this does not mean that you are a sick or infected person::: or that you have the virus::: however::: the viruses that are supposedly ""so aggressive"" present some symptoms in the patients because the body releases alarms from an intruder (fever::: headache::: vomiting::: etc.) and according to Koch's theory the answer is NO.
11. WAS THE VIRUS CREATED?
Yes::: in a laboratory.
13. FOR WHAT PURPOSE?
To be the excuse to restrict freedoms::: to change the current economic system to a more oppressive / enslaving::: scary::: blind flock obedience.
14. ARE MANY COUNTRIES PART OF THIS MALICIOUS PLAN?
Yes.
15. WILL WE GET OUT OF THIS
Yes. And all those who contributed to the deaths and the plan will fall::: and they will pay for what they did.
16. MUST I BE AFRAID?
No. Fear diminishes your immune system and makes you mentally controllable.
17. IS THE MEDIA PART OF THE PLAN?
Yes. The owners of the media are accomplices. This is called mind control.
18. WHAT SHOULD I DO?
You protect yourself::: and if you get sick you already know how to heal yourself at home::: or with your trusted doctor who will not commit to the abandonment protocol.
19. SHOULD I BE VACCINATED?
No. If you get healthy::: vaccines bring chemicals::: heavy metals and a series of ""bugs"" that will only affect your health more in the medium and long term::: both physically and mentally. It's your body::: and it's your right to decide about it::: and about your physical and mental health. Would you trust a vaccine after a virus has been created to exterminate humanity?
20. IS THIS A WAR?
Yes.! And we will be victorious! We need to stay together and wake other people up::: giving a lot of information.

I think glucosamine (via inhibition of il-6 activity and N/O-linked glycosylation) is helping them not get very sick and infect each other. I'm just a housewife with limited time::: but I'll bet some of you biology and premed students would have fun tracking this down. Especially if you've lived there and seen how close together they are packed.,Nathalie and friends come and join me in the frontlines::: then you will find out if you won’t care about the number of cases of COVID-19.,"This is insanity. Look at the statistics as reported by https://
coronavirus.utah
.gov/
case-counts/

The data is not very specific in the College age range::: of the age ranges 0-1::: 1-14::: 15-24::: and Unknown there have only been 2 confirmed deaths. That’s a death rate of 0.009% of cases. Now let’s assume both deaths occurred in the 15-24 age bracket::: that would be a death rate of 0.01% of those infected. And the data does not show if those cases had any comorbidities or other conditions.

According to the US Census data::: there are 522:::832 people in the 15-24 age bracket. With 2 deaths in that bracket::: that is a possible death rate of 0.00038% of students from High School to College.

Please tell me where the problem is?

Grown adults are complaining about students having fun at parties. Students get the probabilities. They understand the risks. It’s as close to zero as any other possibilities::: maybe less.

In contrast::: last year there were 109 suicides in the 18-24 age bracket in Utah. What is BYU doing about suicides? What is the amount of time BYU spends preventing suicides in contrast to the time spent stopping parties that students are actually having fun at? The concentration of effort placed on positive cases of Covid is absurd. Students get over viruses::: they don’t get over suicides. If you’re scared for yourselves::: don’t go to their parties and you wear a mask and goggles and your tin foil hats.","Read your OSHA standards! https://

"A collaborative album between the BYU Chamber Orchestra and Broadway superstar Lea Salonga recently received the 2020 BroadwayWorld Album Award for Best New EP/Solo Release.

The album beat out illustrious competition for the Best Solo Release award::: with runners-up including Ben Platt of “Dear Evan Hansen:::” Leslie Odom Jr. of “Hamilton” and star Kristin Chenoweth.

“This isn’t a college award:::” said BYU professor Kory Katseanes::: who conducted the performance. “It’s an award for professionally produced albums on Broadway. It’s unbelievable—but not undeserved—that BYU won.”

"A primitive insect-like creature that has survived 30 ice ages was recently rediscovered in Antarctica by a team of scientists who had been searching for it for decades.

Researchers::: led in part by BYU’s Byron Adams::: are using the history of the tiny little microscopic Antarctic animals to solidify exactly how ice sheet dynamics played out over time and how they impacted historical ecosystems.

“Biology can be a powerful tool for making inferences about earth history:::” said Adams::: who has traveled to the Ross Ice Shelf in Antarctica every year for the past 17 years to collect samples. “We were thrilled to see the evolutionary history of the organisms is consistent with current models and geological and glaciological estimates of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet dynamics.”",8/28/2020 21:41,TIME 4 FASTING & PRAYER,Tardigrade: Are you challenging me?,Romeo Bobila Lora Jr.,god´s creation is mysterious.,Malonne Ursal Pangan,"This is from the best things I've seen this year

"As the 2020 U.S. elections approach and the pandemic persists::: many states are considering a mandatory vote-by-mail system as a safe alternative to in-person voting. But policymakers are fiercely divided: Will vote-by-mail favor the Democrats::: mobilizing left-leaning voters who ordinarily avoid or miss the polls?

According to a new BYU study::: probably not.

Published in the journal Science Advances::: the research looked at voting patterns in areas that have historically implemented vote-by-mail for federal elections. The BYU professor and his co-author found that while vote-by-mail did increase overall voter turnout by about 2 to 3 percentage points::: it did not change the outcome of races.

“We ran dozens of analyses and every single time we found no impact in partisan vote shares. So whether you’re advocating for vote-by-mail because you think it’s going to be really good for your party or advocating against it because you think it’s going to be bad for your party::: you’re probably wasting your time:::” said Michael Barber::: a BYU professor and co-author of the study.

NEWS.BYU.EDU
Forty years of voting history reveals vote-by-mail does not give either party an edge",8/26/2020 19:45,My concern has always been about the sheer load. If every person voted by mail::: that is a lot more to be counted. A lot more to be delivered. I'd rather not burden the postal service . Besides::: after my sister's wedding pictures got lost in US mail::: I haven't really trusted it since.,You can stand in line at the grocery store but not to vote. Makes sense.,Why is BYU - a church owned school - publishing a story that has such political implications? Besides::: the real issue isn't comparable to absentee voting or traditional mail in voting when you request a ballot. The real issue is that hundreds of thousands of ballots will be mailed to people who have moved or died - resulting in hundreds and thousands of NEW opportunities for voter fraud.,If we can shop at Costco we can vote in person!,Almost a half million Mail-in votes were discounted in the primary elections this year alone. Perhaps no particular party has an edge::: but that’s a lot of voters who had no say in the election process...the voters certainly didn’t have an edge.,There is a difference between proactively sending ballots out to everyone and anyone and people requesting an absentee ballot through the mail.,Better yet::: get your mail in ballot::: vote it::: sign it and TAKE IT TO YOUR POLLING PLACE YOURSELF!! In our town::: it's a mailbox outside the library where you can drive up with no one around and drop it in. No risk of contracting COVID.,A scroll through the Twitter feeds of the co-authors doesn't really increase my confidence of impartiality here. What a shame.,If the goverment can't figure out how to get stimulus checks to everyone like they promised (cause I know people that have yet to see anything from the stimulus checks)::: why should people trust that mail in voting will be any more effective? I really think it's a lack of trust issue at this point. The government and USPS::: which would be facilitating the mail In Voting::: has already shown that they drop the ball too often to be trusted. I know that's the reason I would rather vote in person.,My biggest worry is voter fraud and ballots being mailed out correctly.,Vote by mail via absentee ballot is not the issue. The issue is mass mailing ballots to every name listed on precincts. Many move::: die::: etc and their names are not removed easily::: at least in CA. This opens door for wide scale dishonest voting.,Yeah::: wrong. BYU::: get your act together. Mail in voting is rife with fraud and not the same thing as absentee ballots. I can't believe you would post this.,I have several questions::: though::: BYU. How did your study determine that there was no measurable effect? How could you do that without twice holding a vote::: and then measuring the results? The other questions I have are these: Who is going to count the millions upon millions of mail-in ballots that could come in during this election::: and by when will they be counted? How many will be tossed aside or lost? What is 2 or 3 percentage points across millions of voters::: and what impact would that represent?,There is a vast difference between absentee ballots and universal mail in voting. The study posted here is academically dishonest and manipulative. Sad to see from my Alma mater,I don't trust them doing a nationwide vote in where something is going TO the system vs something coming from the system.,One people need to understand the difference between vote by mail::: and absentee voting. Vote by mail will just get ballots out to everyone and who’s to even say those ballots will get to people::: and if they will even get back in time or be counted correctly. Absentee voting you have to request and there’s tons of things in place to make sure it’s done right. Secondly if you can go to your Walmart::: Costco::: and many other places and wear your mask and social distance you can go and vote.,If they can riot and protest in person and the governors and mayors allow it then they can vote in person.,I still don't trust it. I was changed to democratic in 2016 without my knowledge or consent. I didn't even know about it until I got the ballot.,Does your study take into account all the fake ballots? The purposeful manipulation going into this particular election? 🤦🏻‍♀️,BYU is getting scarier by the moment - California/ liberal hires.....and east coast too! Sickening!!!!,Tell me.... what credibility does left leaning BYU have on this issue?,BYU is quickly losing credibility....,It’s less about giving one side an edge and more that we’ve seen multiple examples of the Democrat party manipulating numbers in past elections and this is just too easy of a system to cheat. If voting isn’t important enough to you for you to carve out some time on Election Day then you probably aren’t informed enough to cast a well thought out vote.,"We just had in-person voting yesterday for a school bond election (idaho). As a poll worker::: we offered a sanitization station with hand sanitizers and masks::: social distancing::: electronic check-in::: cleaning supplies to use on supplies and tables between voters. All wore masks. Everyone who came out appreciated it and felt ""safe"". Total overkill IMO::: but it worked. There's no reason to avoid in-person voting in November.",Another study for the right to be convinced of what everyone already knows. We shouldn’t be wasting studies on this but I guess here we are 🤷🏾‍♂️ Go Cougs,Probably wasting your time ... sort of like voting. That's why I like vote by mail. It wastes the least amount of my time.,Sometimes the professors at BYU need to get out of the UT bubble.,When the postal workers union endorsed Joe Biden - how do any citizens who don’t vote Joe trust the safe delivery of their ballot?,"Fraud is not an issue. It’s been proven over and over. Great study here showing now that one form of voting doesn’t favor one party over another.

And then looking through the comments the level of anti-intellectu
alism and conspiracy insanity on a page that should be dedicated to the search for truth is really sad.

Just like when you pick up an order at IKEA!!,"But now that you have the postal workers union endorsing a particular party/

Up until this year I know of many families with lds missionaries who were thrilled to allow their kids sent to other countries a vote to send back. Utah has lead mail in votes for many years::: but has only had an issue this year for some reason.,Why not vote in person? Nobody reading this hasn't stood in a line for a less important purpose in the last 6 months.,There should be a choice. Vote by mail or go to the polls.,30% of Mail is lost over the course of a year. The post office has already said that they don’t know how it will be possible because some laws just don’t line up. With the amount of ballots being brought in people will have to send them in 15 days prior in order for their vote to count. A lot of votes will potentially late or lost in the post office network,If people can go to the store::: they can vote in person. Voter fraud is rampant. Mail in ballots do not have the many checks absentee voter ballots do.,Vote by mail will favor the dishonest. It's that simple. Too many opportunities for fraud and not enough resulting oversight::: because oversight becomes such a huge task in the Vote-by-mail scenario.,I think you missed the point on this... Your Theory is only good if everyone is 100% honest.,There are huge differences between mail-in ballots that have safety measures in place to verify who completed the ballot (or things such as absentee ballots which are requested by the voter) versus the massive mailing of live ballots to residences based on outdated voter registrations. The latter are the problem & are ripe for fraud!,If it’s safe enough to stand in line at Walmart it’s safe enough to vote.,You’ve missed the entire issue. It’s not a matter of whether it favors one party over another. It’s that voter fraud prevalent with mail-in voting. Democrats::: actually Leftists within the Democrat party::: with their “ends justify the means” attitude are more likely to commit such fraud. So::: yes::: it does favor one party.,I still get mail for my ex::: my friend who lived here for a couple months while her house was being built and even her husband who died before she ever lived here.,The only election fraud will be by and/or on behalf of the current administration.,Simply mailing a ballot to a voter's last known address has fewer verification checks than absentee voting where voters must request a ballot. Both use the mail::: but the controls are different.,The amount of Voter Fraud with mail in voting is way too much. People are getting mailed ballots to people that are dead. There was even a story of a dead cat that got a ballot. In the last election for local stuff::: I got 2 ballots. There are many instances where ballot harvesters are caught whether through the postal workers or otherwise.,What if the reason you are opposed to it is because of neither of those reasons?,This election is different than most.,"Also::: you're getting ratioed now which is pretty hard to do on Facebook. Congratulations
on your dishonest reporting.",Just think about the long battle that is going to take place during the election when they start throwing out ballots that aren’t legal.,If a person fills out three hundred mail in ballots::: how does that make anything fair? And that's what liberals are all about.,This is a year with so much hate against one candidate that I would not discount the possibility of people trying to influence the election in ways not seen in the past.,Man::: it's sad how up and arms people get about what data say. 😬,The question is::: what kind of judges will be ruling when there is disputes about large scale failures in the system. The Democrats did vote by mail for their primary::: and no one knows who won.,The issue isn't which party it would favor::: the problem is voter fraud. This is a misleading article::: disappointing coming from BYU.,Prob written by associated press . Very liberal articles that does not reflect our church’s thinking . Trump 2020🇺🇸,"I wish you would have just studied the ""claim"" that it shows fraud or a problem. I'm not concerned about it favoring one party or another::: I just need to know that the obvious voter suppression is stopped.","Ballot harvesting? Take a look at Orange County::: California in November 2018. Over 300:::000 ""harvested ballots"" were dropped off in bundles at polling stations. These ballots were overwhelming for Democrats. Nearly every seat in Orange County flipped to the Democrats. Now::: what were you saying about outcome?",I had extra ballots sent to my home that I’ve been in for years from people who have lived here previously. And when I tried to comment on it on some of our elected officials twitter and nationally publicated articles I was censored.,"Let's just set up polling places at home depot or Walmart those all seem to be safe places for folks to gather..

We can sit on an airplanes with our masks::: can pop in to the gas or grocery store and waiting in line and use the same keypad as the others::: why can’t we go vote in person???,Applications never sent to people not asking for them to be sent before. Traditionally mail in ballots are for people who asked for them. We never tried to count tens of millions of mail in votes at a time. When an area has hundreds of thousands it takes days. It’s about delaying the victory or changing it. Disappointed every college is so liberal.,Sadly enough::: there have been some arrested for fraud!!! Not everyone is honest in there dealings with thtere fellow man!,I call BS on this. Has BYU gone woke? My father passed away July 30::: 2020.

It’s an imperfect system and we have to have faith in the process. As a mail in voter for years I have never felt concerned. I drop my ballot off at an official collection site days in advance.

There is a vast difference between absentee ballots::: which 20% are rejected each time::: versus vote-by-mail.,"For everyone worried that BYU is becoming ""too liberal:::"" the church (and by default BYU) does not support or oppose any platform or political perspectives. This was a study done to find facts::: not make a political statement. The study conducted is simply stating that voting by mail does not help one party or the other. It isn't trying to convince you to vote one way or another. https://

fraud",The communist and anti American BYU at it again. It’s pathetic that you consider yourself an educational institution when you can’t conduct a single “study” correctly. For a institution claiming to be of Christ::: you all have long since forsaken him.,"Calif has over 2million on the voter rolls::: more than eligible voters in the state!!
Who gets to send in the extra 2 million ballots that will be mailed? Fraud!",Shut up BYU. Stay out of politics. Vote by mail has never been a thing anyway::: morons. Absentee voting is different than vote by mail.,Crazy to see so many people decide their university is fraudulent after it posted studies saying masks are effective and voting by mail is reliable. Would you prefer they avoid researching current issues just in case it might go against what a politician says?,Lol::: first of all::: you only looked at federal elections where only a few states implemented mail in voting. Recent local elections show you how elections can be manipulated. Also the motivation for fraud is much higher given the political climate and that is something that cannot be measured. Also I’d ballots are marked with an R for republican and a D for Democrat as many people say they are::: then that is a huge red flag. This study is irrelevant to the times. Try again.,"The problem is sending ballots to names in the rolls that didn't deliberately request one. Mass mailing means there'll be blank ballots sent to address of the deceased::: people who have moved::: etc.::: which enables fraudulent votes to be cast (for either party).

A more secure election is one where individuals must actively request to receive a ballot and re-confirm their address. This is what has been going on for a while and it's fine.

Also::: any logical person can see that keeping polling places open for those that prefer it is not a problem. We have restaurants and grocery stores and we're fine. If you're not comfortable going in-person::: then request an absentee ballot.","This study appears to have nothing to do with mail-in voter fraud. However::: since that’s what everybody here is talking about::: here’s an unbiased look on its benefits and drawbacks.

82SA",Well I guess BYU has turned into morons! We are not talking about absentee ballots—but mailing ballots out to everyone without anyone having to prove you are who it says on the ballot!,There are thousands of people who handle the mail in ballots and not everyone is honest. It’s been known that mail in ballots have been thrown away by workers. The envelopes say on the outside if you’re republican or democrat.,"You sort of missed the point::: BYU.

The point of concern isn't whether or not simply ""vote by mail"" gives one party an ""edge"" over the other. I don't think anyone believes that if the vote is by mail::: that more people in one party will vote than the other. There's no reason for anyone to believe::: nor have I heard anyone say::: that one party uses the USPS more often than another::: or will refuse to vote if it's by mail. (Unless Green Party people refuse to do vote by mail because it uses more paper and kills more trees and they all decide not to vote? Somehow I doubt that.)

The issue is whether or not vote by mail makes it easier to commit voter FRAUD. Obviously::: there is a need for people to be able to vote by mail. Some people just can't get out to do it. But the concern is that the MORE vote-by-mail there is::: the more FRAUD there will be. A quick look at the CONVICTIONS of voter fraud cases shows that a LOT of them were committed THROUGH mail in::: absentee voting and creating false registrations for mail-in voting. And all jurisdictions KNOW that.

There have already been several instances::: just in the past couple months. People have been getting ballots for people who USED to live at their address. One woman had 4 ballots for 4 different people sent to her. Another woman noticed that the bar code on the envelopes included an ""R"" on hers::: and a ""D"" on her brother's::: and the city VERIFIED that the codes include R and D for party affiliation. There are more instances all over the country.

The other issue is the ""why"". Why ""mandatory"" mail in voting? It's very difficult to believe that the why is truly for Covid safety concerns::: when restaurants are open::: schools are open::: grocery stores are open::: and heaven knows::: the protestors and rioters are free to roam the streets with no social distancing being enforced. The ONLY reason to make it mandatory::: would be to allow more fraud to occur.

What were their experiences and what would happen if states were required to change their voting procedures. Would they be prepared in time to handle the increase in ballot processing?

Imagine ”ballot harvesting” where vast numbers of people from one party canvas large areas::: offering to ”assist” particular party voters in filling out their ballots and delivering them. Example result: Two years ago::: 5 California Congressional Republican candidates led comfortably on election night in an historically conservative county. However::: days later::: after mail-in ballots were counted::: all 5 Republicans lost to Democrats. Manipulation? Fraud? Fair?","The worst Fires in American History out west.

of Sin ! This is our chosen Standard Bearer for the Christian Church in America ?! Does anyone really believe that this is pleasing to GOD ?! Gatherings of neo Nazis in Germany are now chanting "" Trump is our Savior !!! Rev. 3:16-17 "" I will spit you out "" !
Some have excused this unholy alliance of Church and State by saying::: God sometimes uses ungodly evil persons to excercise his Will. In the Book of Revelation we learn that GOD will allow the ANTICHIST to bring the False Peace to Israel for three and a half years ! Yes BUT ! Never in the Testament of Jesus Christ has our LORD instructed His People to look up to and follow an ungodly leader. Pay taxes yes. Follow and support NO !

""Safely returning to campus is important for our community::: but it will be challenging. For us to succeed in this new and different environment::: we all have to play our part::: making adjustments that::: while perhaps are personally inconvenient::: are necessary for the good of the whole. The BYU mission statement says that all relationships within the BYU community should reflect 'a loving::: genuine concern for the welfare of our neighbor.' That love for each other is what can make this year’s BYU experience a remarkable period of growth for each member of our university community. We look forward to safely gathering soon.""

"A large-scale project from BYU professors and students is gathering lost stories of a generation that survived extreme hardships under the Khmer Rouge regime (1975-79) where nearly 2 million Cambodians were killed or died.

As a community that relies on oral and not written histories::: many of the stories of past Cambodian generations are being lost.

Known as the Cambodian Oral History Project::: the group from BYU has collected nearly 5:::000 interviews for this project through the help of local Cambodian leaders.

Telling their stories can help the Cambodian people heal in a small way from the devastation they faced years ago::: helping family members understand who their parents and grandparents are and also who they are.

For over 30 years living in a third country::: I’d tried hard to erase the scar of this bloody past::: but I can’t. The more I’d tried to forgive::: the more I can’t forget. Everyday::: I’d tried to run away from the bloody past::: the past caught up on me faster and stronger. It was like running away from a mountain.

But I’d tried all::: working two jobs::: burring myself in schoolwork::: involving in community activities::: never talking about the past::: etc. Not a single effort had worked. The scar of the past is too deep to erase. I still slept with nightmares. I still saw the tyrants with guns and cleavers chasing after me in my dream. I decided to walk straight back to my past. That was six years ago. I was tired living and walking with a bagful of the tragic past on my back. Somehow::: it wasn’t easy::: especially when I went back to an unknown graveyard where a man told me that he had buried my two beautiful children who’d perished one after another from prolonged starvation. The dark memory returned so fresh::: so vivid that I felt decimated::: hopeless. I sobbed.

Yours could be more painful than of mine. But ours could be less tragic than of our friends next door. Come out and tell your story.

"A new analysis of 115+ studies on the effectiveness of masks in controlling COVID-19 has gotten a lot of attention with stories from the Deseret News::: The Salt Lake Tribune::: KUER 90.1 and others today.

The analysis has also gone viral on Twitter and is spreading throughout Instagram via a spotlight in our story that just published.

What prompted the report: BYU professor Ben Abbott seeing a lengthy debate about masks::: where else::: but right here on Facebook. 🙂 (Details in the KUER story we've linked to.)

The comprehensive analysis by Dr. Abbott and three of his students provides important insight and context about mask wearing amid this global pandemic. Overall::: the researchers conclude from the research that:

""Masks could be one of the most powerful and cost-effective tools to stop COVID-19 and accelerate the economic recovery.""

Within the studies::: the researchers found that masks are highly safe::: with only minor and uncommon side effects. In addition to many medical studies::: public masking has been proven safe among children::: adults and the elderly.

""There is now convincing evidence from multiple controlled experiments and field observations that wearing masks reduces the transmission of COVID-19 for healthcare workers and the public. Most of this evidence is COVID-19 specific and has emerged in the past few months.""

BYU Researcher Says The Science Is Crystal Clear: Wear A Mask",7/21/2020 1:18,Don't mind us. Just checking in periodically to look at the comments and ...,"My opinion about this study has to do with the study itself and has nothing to do with my thoughts on mask wearing.

As a scientist myself::: I have two major problems with this report. One is that there is no original research in this report. It is a study of studies::: which I have no way to verify any of the methods used or data collected. I cannot simply accept a conclusion or what someone tells me the study says. In general::: I will totally ignore studies with no original research for this reason.
Two::: this is outside of the area of expertise of everyone involved. While there are some things that translate between scientific disciplines::: there are many things that don't. Being a scientist of any sort generally qualifies you to read and have an understanding of any report::: but does not qualify you to publish your conclusion.

I am sure they had good intentions. But::: I cannot (and really we should not) accept their conclusions.",This study is the answer to the wrong question. In a pandemic you are supposed to quarantine the sick::: not restrict the healthy. The entire COVID-19 response is an assault on our liberties. Far more people will die from the response to the pandemic than will be killed by the pandemic. Every job that feeds a family is an essential job.,Good work! Thank you for doing this vital research. It will bless many lives. God bless ❤️,Ok here’s what I don’t understand. My opinions (whether they be political or personal) aside::: if people are so scared about spreading the virus so much::: why does the answer ALWAYS have to be “wear a mask?” Regardless of whether people believe it’s the right thing to keep other people safe or whether the Leftist have an agenda with the virus and the mandatory use of masks::: why can’t there be an alternative solution to this whole problem? If the problem itself is the spreading of the virus::: aren’t there other ways to take care of it? Why not wear a face shield if people are so scared of the spreading? Can’t that be a compromise to Pro-Maskers and Anti-Maskers if anything?,Scientists will take a theory and try to pass it off as fact. Science is great when they actually do have some facts but this is beyond their scope of knowledge. Fishing in the dark is what I call it.,I do wonder::: if mask wearing is so powerful at preventing the spread of COVID-19::: how did it spread so quickly in the cities in China where the population wears masks on a daily basis::: often N95 masks?,Take it with a grain of salt and don't let someone else do the research for you. Most of the sources are from 2020. Not enough time to provide solid evidence that any study they did actually works. Also claiming the local news or BBC as a source is not a good idea either if you are trying to prove a point,Hi. My husband was one of the students who worked on this paper. First::: they received zero funding from BYU to do this research. There was absolutely no agenda. Second::: they looked at ALL of the data. Over 115 studies! They did not pick and choose studies that supported a certain ideology. They looked at all of the evidence::: explored all of the science::: and broke it down so the average person could understand it. Please::: just open the paper. You’ll see how much work they put it and how in depth they went. You’ll see that all of their sources are credible and peer reviewed. They did this out of their own time and free will because they wanted to explore the evidence (both pros and cons) of wearing masks. The evidence was overwhelming. Please don’t assume everything you read online is true. Don’t disregard the 115+ credible sources for the one you found online. Read the evidence yourself and form an educated opinion before you blindly attack those just trying to get to the bottom of this issue.,Say what you want. I don't trust anyone about this issue::: though I have read a great deal of stuff that is totally opposite of you and they make more sense.,"Can't see people's faces...no emotions...phys

Their response ”you shouldn't wear a mask unless you have been fitted and oxygen levels tested. This makes everything so confusing.,Are there maybe some anti-maskers on here who think they're being asked to wear masks all the time? Because you're not. It's just when you're around other people like at stores or at work. Is it really that big of a deal to you?,Y'all Utahns are wild man 😳 idk how anyone can argue that wearing a mask DOESNT prevent the spread of respiratory droplets...... But if you are going to refute science too I guess there's no getting though to any of you until your friends and family start contracting it.... Some of my best friends have parents who died. Fine one day and gone the next. There are many different strains and you have no way of being able to predict which you have and how badly it will hit you,D&C 45:31 says that “a desolating sickness shall cover the land.” The more arguments and disunity I see from church members here::: the more I think COVID-19 fits the bill. This disease is not only “desolating” because it makes people sick and some even die; it is “desolating” the economy::: people’s jobs::: and people’s relationships. I’m seeing the desolation::: in real time::: of church members who are becoming very disunified—the opposite of what Zion is. My opinion is that we should follow our church leaders on this. I don’t live in Utah::: but the advice to wear a mask shouldn’t only apply to Utahns. Some are saying that they won’t wear a mask unless it comes from the prophet::: but he has delegated authority to others. Moses tried to do all the work of prophet on his own until he was advised by Jethro to delegate smaller matters to others and only focus on the big things. It’s so sad to see how truly “desolating” this disease is::: not only for its medical issues.,Funny how the anti maskers I’ve seen have never actually treated COVID patients.🤔,The scientific research goes both ways.

I'll be hanging out in the other 20%,Sorry....I will not. And I am just disappointed that BYU has participated in this.....,If you truly love one another::: wear a mask,Sounds political to me. And the last line of the article::: “The evidence suggests that if we could all — 80%::: or more::: of us — wear masks for several weeks::: we could get this under control and start getting back to normal.” is a joke because we’ve been told something different beginning in March. Remember when this was supposed to “flatten the curve”?? That happened.

Meta-analyses are a common way for scientists to get a clearer picture.

Edit: Most of those asking for citations don't plan on reading them::: just as most of you didn't bother to read the actual study that is mentioned above::: for if you had::: you would see that it's not of any worth.

This study is the first RCT of cloth masks::: and the results caution against the use of cloth masks. This is an important finding to inform occupational health and safety. Moisture retention::: reuse of cloth masks and poor filtration may result in increased risk of infection. Further research is needed to inform the widespread use of cloth masks globally.

From the WHO: There is limited evidence that wearing a medical mask by healthy individuals in the households or among contacts of a sick patient::: or among attendees of mass gatherings may be beneficial as a preventive measure.14-23 However::: there is currently no evidence that wearing a mask (whether medical or other types) by healthy persons in the wider community setting::: including universal community masking::: can prevent them from infection with respiratory viruses::: including COVID-19.
Prolonged wearing of the surgical mask causes loss of intellect potential and cognitive performance due to a decrease in blood oxygen and subsequent brain hypoxia. Note - some changes may be irreversible.

n",Keep your distance and wash your hands::: the rest is garbage.,This is a study covering only a couple of months. Meta studies over more than decades show non-medical masks are ineffective against viruses including influenza and H1N1. There is a consensus in the medical world that the most effective means to avoid infection is WASH YOUR HANDS::: DON'T TOUCH YOUR FACE AND MAINTAIN PHYSICAL DISTANCE. If wearing a mask makes you feel safer::: you are free to do so even if there is no solid data to support it.,Um::: you don't 'stop' a virus. Flattening the curve means the same amount of infections over a longer time period. Not stopping it 🤦‍♀️,"This is why it is important to check the sources of even reputable organizations like BYU. One assistant professor of ecosystem ecology and 3 students is considered a comprehensive review and analysis of the data pertaining to mask wearing? 🤦‍♀️

I guess those pre-Covid hacks were just wrong.,"What am I missing? With all due respect a doo-rag covering your face does nothing. It has been said it’s like trying to stop mosquitoes from flying through a chain link fence. A placebo at best. Those blue surgical masks seem to be the other most common mask. They are also virtually useless too. Why? They are made to be used in a sterile environment::: like an operating room...a room where there are no tiny virus floating around. The blue mask is made to reduce things that are roughly 200x bigger like bacteria from the human mouth. Also::: they have virtually no seal face to mask. The topic of droplets and aerosols came up. Here too the masks do very little. You can make a small case that if you cough::: droplets are suppressed. Droplets fall to the ground quickly::: so that is not really the issue. What about aerosol? Like I said::: no cloth or surgical mask is stopping a tiny virus size particle. If you are talking N95 or N100::: they can make a difference. But reality shows that no one in any quantity has those. And face shields are really needed with them to do the best job. With the virus having a 99.65% survival rate anyhow::: wearing a mask is not going to make a difference. Personally::: I wear one to make others ""feel"" better::: but it does little. Wash your hands::: stay apart (no riots & looting please). That will help more that a mask in the outdoors. No??","So::: is the goal again to slow the spread so that the availability of health care resources is not overwhelmed? Because the only end to this pandemic is innoculation::: either by infection and recovery or a vaccine. Run-and-hide isn't gonna get us to the other side of this.

There are a few references in the meta-analysis that suggest that masking is intended to ""stop the spread"" and a lot of the media messaging continues to imply (brow-beat::: more like) that masking will help us end this faster. That's not going to happen. We'll just rubber band from a low infection rate to a high infection rate until enough people have the antibodies that this is effectively over. The theoretical ideal::: given the lack of a safe and effective and widely available vaccine::: is for the virus to spread as quickly as possible without overwhelming hospitals and with special precautions to isolate high-risk individuals.

If we need to mask up in order to manage the availability of health care resources without unnecessarily dragging this out::: then great. So far::: that hasn't been the case and::: as has been pointed out::: the politicos and media have burned up what little credibility they had left when they kept shifting the goalposts to keep people scared when their initial apocalyptic forecast of 2M people dying fell completely flat. Classic ""boy who cried wolf"" scenario.

I got the cringes from Goldman Sachs's analysis that masking would prevent ""the need for a second round of economic shutdowns"". The available data analysis on that demonstrated that there was no statistically significant correlation between the severity of economic lockdowns and the spread of COVID-19 (offhand::: I recall that the p-value was in the neighborhood of .35). Anybody suggesting this route again should be immediately dismissed and discredited.

I appreciate the honest effort to show what's out there in the medical literature::: but it's difficult to trust what anyone is saying. The politicization of the issue was its downfall from the beginning.",It’s funny but I’ve seen several other reports of doctors refute wearing masks because of the harm it does making people breathe back in their own carbon dioxide::: other pathogens and bacteria. The reason you don’t see a lot of these reports and studies is because YouTube and other social media outlets keep shutting them down and won’t let the truth be known about them.,Okay where are the 115 studies you researched? I would love an index referencing each one::: so I can do my own research. Nothing in this article shows where you came up with your claims. What the science is to back up your claims. Also::: by saying only those who can not take them off themselves should be exempt from wearing them::: shows your ignorance to those adults and children with special needs. Specifically sensory issues::: or trauma related anxiety::: ect. This article is not based on any scientific evidence or proof. It's from a self decided expert.,"What if it happen like this?

BYU study::: June 2021::: “mandatory vaccines are the only way to prevent the spread of COVID-19.”

Marriott school study::: September 2021::: digitally imbedded vaccine ID chip is the only option to maintain the ability to buy and sell and keep the economy functioning. We must become a cashless society.

Conference::: October 2021. Digital vaccine ID is the mark of the beast as foretold in Revelation 13.

BYU statement::: October 10::: 2021. “We were wrong.”

Maybe it turns out differently and I sincerely hope I’m wrong::: but regardless the Overton window has officially shifted.

Those of us who are against the use of masks recognize the political manipulation and fear mongering. We are against the shifting Overton Window on this policy. Mandatory masks in schools during flu season would be considered unconscionable in October 2019.

On another note::: The secret combinations warned about throughout the Book of Mormon won’t let this good crisis go to waste. They’ll say::: you don’t have to wear masks if you get the vaccine and show your Vax-ID.

Remember the Book of Mormon is a witness and warning for our day and the thing that destroyed both the Jaredite and Nephite civilizations was secret combinations.

Will Latter-day Saints stand up against the great secret combination::: the mother of harlots::: the great and abominable church?

Or will they go to their Gadianton masters and ask them for salvation? “I’ll wear your mask::: I’ll get your shot::: I’ll get your mark....”

Remember Ether 8::: Helaman 2:12-13::: and look up President Benson’s October 1988 talk “I testify.”

Is this what we were warned against? Maybe I’m wrong::: but when good citizens are chastised for not wearing masks and anarchists are excused during race riots::: I call BS.

And before you comment::: read Benson’s ‘88 talk. “More Highly organized::: more cleverly disguised::: and more powerfully promoted...” That was 30 years ago!!!

You’ve been warned. Now sling your arrows and rocks....",Wow no one came up with a cogent answer to my question... which is what I am looking for... just personal attacks. I guess I have a valid point. doo-rags and those blue masks are basically placebos.,Shaming and mandating is the real issue.

Idaho knew this back in the fifties when the salk vaxx killed little kids there. Be ye clean that bear the vessels of the Lord.","⚡️The pandemic is over⚡️ most states NEVER should have issued lockdowns. we knew then but we KNOW even better now.
🔥Dr. Jayanta Bhattacharya::: a medical professor at Stanford University
🔥Dr. Martin Kulldorff::: a medical professor at Harvard University
🔥 Michael Levitt::: a structural biology professor at Stanford University
“..schools could reopen without enforcing mask-wearing::: citing schools in Sweden that remained open during the pandemic without masks in a recently published editorial in the Wall Street Journal::: co-authored by Bhattachayra.

“At this point::: we know that the benefits of a lockdown are small. ... All they do is push cases off into the future; it doesn’t actually prevent the disease from happening. And the costs are absolutely catastrophic::: enormous:::” Bhattacharya said.

Hunting for asymptomatic cases encourages pointless shutdowns. Protect the vulnerable instead.
Bhattacharya has also been vocal about lockdowns and mandates being ineffective in combating the virus’ spread and recently came under fire for his participation in an antibody study that estimated the number of COVID-19 infections is significantly higher than numbers show::: Buzzfeed News reported.
Levitt::: who received the 2013 Nobel Prize in chemistry::: has been quoted in news outlets across the country for predicting back in March that the pandemic would not result in millions of deaths and months of shutdowns::: the L.A. Times reported.
A central question DeSantis posed to each was whether another statewide lockdown should no longer be an option. The three experts agreed that another lockdown would cause more damage than good.
Bhattacharya answered DeSantis by saying another lockdown in Florida “would be disastrous.”

Kulldorff said elected officials should be doing as much as possible to protect the elderly while still allowing children and young adults to go about life normally::: albeit with more frequent hand-washing.
“These sort of general lockdowns for closing schools::: for closing restaurants::: for closing beaches or whatever::: that actually has a detrimental effect on public health ...” he said. “We are protecting very low-risk college students and professionals who can work from home while we are putting all the working-class people at risk because they have to work.”

Kulldorff said universities should operate “almost normally” and that students should be on campus attending in-person classes and that there does not need to be testing at colleges and universities.
People are still locking down and engaging in behavior which is likely to be detrimental in the long run:::” Levitt said.

From the WHO: There is limited evidence that wearing a medical mask by healthy individuals in the households or among contacts of a sick patient::: or among attendees of mass gatherings may be beneficial as a preventive measure.14-23 However::: there is currently no evidence that wearing a mask (whether medical or other types) by healthy persons in the wider community setting::: including universal community masking::: can prevent them from infection with respiratory viruses::: including COVID-19.
Prolonged wearing of the surgical mask causes loss of intellect potential and cognitive performance due to a decrease in blood oxygen and subsequent brain hypoxia. Note - some changes may be irreversible.

"In the United States::: girls represent only about 20% of autism diagnoses. While boys may simply be more likely to have autism than girls::: mental health professionals suspect that girls are also more adroit at suppressing autistic traits::: which could prevent their autism from being diagnosed::: if it is diagnosed at all::: until they are adults. Without an autism diagnosis::: any mental health concerns these women experience may be misinterpreted.

New BYU research draws attention to the challenges such women face. The study showed a strong correlation between how much women with autistic traits camouflage—hide or compensate for autistic qualities to fit in—and the severity of their mental health concerns.

"We’re announcing today plans for an in-person fall semester. This decision is subject to change depending on trends in disease prevalence and guidance from state and local governments.

The following are the general plans::: and we will keep detailed updates coming as fall semester draws near.

- Fall semester will start August 31 with a hybrid of in-person and remote delivery.
- Fall semester classes and exams will be remote after Thanksgiving break. If you travel home for Thanksgiving::: you’ll be encouraged to finish the semester there.
- Face coverings will be required in all classroom settings::: inside all university buildings::: during interactions with campus guests or customers and in other areas where directed.
- Priority registration for fall semester will begin July 6. You’ll be notified via YMessage of your specific registration date. Class schedules and the registration cart with be available later this afternoon.
- There will be a phased return to campus for students in on-campus housing.

The safety and protection of the BYU community is BYU’s first priority. BYU students in high-risk categories::: including older adults and those who are immunocompromised::: are strongly encouraged to not be on campus during fall semester 2020. Additionally::: those who will be caring for or sharing living spaces with high-risk individuals are encouraged to not be on campus during fall semester 2020. Remote coursework options are available for students in these situations. Students will have the ability during class registration to choose from those courses designated as “live remote delivery” and ""on-demand remote delivery."" High-risk students can contact their advisement centers or call (801) 422-4104 for registration assistance.

From President Worthen:

“For this to succeed::: we all have to play our part. The BYU mission statement says that all relationships within the BYU community should reflect ‘a loving::: genuine concern for the welfare of our neighbor.’ Certainly that can be our motivation for wearing a face covering::: washing our hands often::: and staying home when we're sick. We can react with empathy when someone we know tests positive for COVID-19. We can fight the virus of contempt with kindness even as we debate how to best respond as a society to the pandemic.

That genuine love for each other is what will make this year's BYU experience a remarkable period of growth for each one of us. We look forward to safely gathering soon.”

ABR is a non-profit firm which has been the subject of criminal referrals from House and Senate committees investigating whether Planned Parenthood or any other entity was illegally profiting from the handling of fetal tissue from aborted babies.
“These documents are a horror show:::” said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton. “These records show that the FDA was trafficking in human fetal parts. Incredibly::: there continues to be a push to reopen these monstrous experiments!”

conflict:::
3. As a teacher::: mixing online and in-person is a mess logistically but::: more particularly::: is inevitably unequal. Students who feel compelled to attend online are necessarily disadvantaged compared to their in-person peers::: which is only aggravated by departments' insistence that grades follow predetermined distributions:::
4. The fact that this is all subject to change means that we cannot reasonably rely or plan based on this announcement. This will also lead to landlord-tenant

Compared to 1965::: fathers spend 3 times more time with their kids during the week. A new BYU study found that employers who help facilitate a fair work-life balance are a big reason those dads feel more connected with their children.

“Researchers know that quality father involvement has a meaningful impact on kids’ social::: emotional and cognitive development::: as well as their overall sense of well-being:::” said BYU professor Erin Holmes::: the study's lead researcher.

"At the request of President Kevin J Worthen and under the direction of Academic Vice President Shane Reese::: last week a committee was appointed to examine issues of race and inequality at BYU and provide recommendations to the university about specific actions to address these issues. The committee will meet for the first time this week.

The committee will first prioritize opportunities to better listen to::: and better understand::: the experiences of black students::: faculty and staff on campus to help inform adjustments and changes that can assist BYU in being a more safe and welcoming place for BYU’s community members of color.

The committee takes seriously the charge issued by President Russell M. Nelson and leaders of the NAACP:

“We likewise call on government::: business::: and educational leaders at every level to review processes::: laws::: and organizational attitudes regarding racism and root them out once and for all. It is past time for every one of us to elevate our conversations above divisive and polarizing rhetoric. Treating others with respect matters. Treating each other as sons and daughters of God matters.”

Along with President Nelson’s encouragement on social media to:

- Foster our faith in the Fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man.
- Foster a fundamental respect for the human dignity of every human soul::: regardless of their color::: creed or cause.
- Work tirelessly to build bridges of understanding rather than creating walls of segregation.

The newly-appointed committee members are:

Moises Aguirre::: Multicultural Student Services
Ryan Gabriel::: Department of Sociology
Lita Little Giddins::: College of Family::: Home::: and Social Science
Vern Heperi::: Office of Student Success and Inclusion
Carl Hernandez III::: J. Reuben Clark Law School
Jon McBride::: University Communications
Stephani Perkins::: Athletics – Women’s Track
Shane Reese::: Academic Vice President’s Office

Beyond this committee::: many other members of our BYU community will be utilized in assisting in this work. Of particular importance will be the voice of BYU students.

The committee is eager to get started::: and will immediately commence its work by reaching out to many students and members of the BYU community::: ready to listen.",6/18/2020 17:04,"One final thought as stakeholders move forward: let's consider what it means to ""care""-\-\why do we ""care about"" these issues related to race and inequality? Are we simply responding to external pressures? Do we care enough to be bold in our actions? And pressing forward::: how do we show that we ""care for"" one another as members of the body of Christ?","I love that you want to address inequality::: and this is a great step in the right direction!💙 But inequality cannot be fully addressed without including someone with a disability in the conversation::: too.

If you’re purely focusing on racism::: then you should be more clear with the committee title. Because the disabled experience inequality::: too.

#ableism #chronicallystro
ng #t1d",Boarding the media train? What issues are being addressed::: and why have we waited until now if there have been racial issues?,Civil Rights is about equality::: not segregation. Celebrate our ancestral cultures where appropriate::: but be united in all things.,If someone ask me what I am::: I’m gonna tell them that I’m Mandalorian.,One positive from this announcement already is that it shines the spotlight on BYU's Multicultural Student Services. It often feels like the special education classroom in a portable building separate from the rest of the school...,"I’m very happy to hear this. I hope that the committee and those receiving their recommendations
can be open minded and have the courage to make real changes.",Thank you!!!,Please consider changing the name of the school. There are many::: many great people in church history who are not heavily associated with racism. Name BYU after someone else,"Liked ""Of particular importance will be the voice of BYU students."" The BYU student body looks forward to understanding how our voices will be heard. Importantly::: how will our voices::: especially the voices of those who feel marginalized::: be incorporated into change?",Today::: I am actually proud to be a cougar.,Shouldn't this have already been a priority a long time ago!?,"BYU GREAT START FOR CHANGE!

I am not one to post strong opinions on social media like this. Nevertheless::: I felt a very strong need to do so as it is something that is so near and dear to my heart. I would::: however::: like to preface this by saying that it is not my intention to tarnish the name of BYU in any way::: because I am in fact a very proud graduate of Brigham Young University.

Believe me::: there are many great lessons and experiences that BYU and the people that I met here brought into my life. However::: there is an undeniable::: unfortunate truth that accompanied me throughout my time at BYU and that is a constant feeling of inadequacy rooted in my not being part of the majority (i.e.::: a Caucasian student).

Looking back::: I should’ve been more involved in BYUSA and activities::: but I wasn’t. Why? Because I never felt I belonged or that my opinion would be valued the same as that of my Caucasian peers. The truth is there is strength in numbers. Assuming that BYUSA membership is an accurate representation of the ethnic demographics of the university::: that would mean my opinion as a minority student would be 81% more likely to be outvoted by my peers.

I think that multicultural student should be encouraged to take part in student body leadership. How::: you may ask? By demonstrating and fostering a welcoming atmosphere towards other cultures::: backgrounds::: opinions::: experiences::: and languages.

I propose two small actionable items that can demonstrate additional desire for change:

1. Move the BYU Multicultural and International offices #outofthebasemen
t floor and unto the same level as BYUSA. This will help prevent multicultural students from feeling they are not on the same level as their Caucasian peers.

2. Have BYUSA promote and engage in the multicultural activities organized by Multicultural Student Service and International Service Offices. (Once::: I asked if I could leave some flyers for a Multicultural Student Services event::: a university sponsored event::: an event supported by the Dean::: and I was told NO::: because they only promoted BYUSA events.)

Riddle me this: are we not on the same team? are we not on the same level?

Let’s continue towards Becoming One.",I am happy to see Lita Little Giddins’ name on that list. She is filled with experience::: wisdom::: talent and love.,Fatherhood of God and brotherhood of man is certainly accurate but has an unpleasant Victorian history. And how about changing the school's name to Eliza Snow University. How about some statues of female leaders?,There is always a concern that the representation of diverse voices from an institution becomes an exercise in tokenism. The selection must be judicious to avoid that appearance. I doubt not that the members are up to the task but must be wary of any power dynamics that will hamper the efforts of fulfilling the objectives delineated::: first::: to listen and understand and::: then::: enact change.,Is it just black students? There are other skin colors there.,Where are the accountants on the committee? LOL,I like the NAACP mission statement and history. I became a member. I google for the BLM creed and was grieved to read the anti-family stance.,I hope they don't even consider changing the name of BYU. I remember wonderful times there with people of many races and cultures. I love that so many languages are spoken on campus. I love the spiritual atmosphere and the great musical performances. Please don't change what is so good.,In some cases::: it takes a crisis to recognize and meet the challenges of the past and present (e.g.::: institutional racism). Beyond it being a reactionary move as some may construed it to be::: I hope this is more than that.,Just as long as us other minorities also are thought of::: then great!,I suggest you go to a different school if you don’t like it.,I hope BYU does make a drastic move of racism. Back in the 50's some of our students from our home town of Laie in including my sister did confront racism from kids within the area they were living in Provo.,Thank you!! This is great news.,And y is it always a black and white issue? This could be good but mostly ur going with group think.,How can we contact the committee to voice our opinions?,This is great news! I’m excited to see more progress,"""Only the gospel will save the world from the calamity of its own self-destructio
n. Only the gospel will unite men of all races and nationalities in peace. Only the gospel will bring joy::: happiness::: and salvation to the human family.""
-Ezra Taft Benson
BYU is in good hands with its leaders. It is important that each individual comes together and becomes unified in the gospel. As those leaders do so::: I do not see a problem coming forward out of decisions made. What a wonderful blessing it is to have our Heavenly Father's trust to be sent here at this time!",What about discussions related to the experience of other minoritized groups including Latino students?,I hope BYU stays strong and does not rename buildings or take down any statues. They are our history. Cancel culture needs to stop.,"This kind of thinking is not in keeping with the church....I hope that they will reconsider and not cave to the chaos that is happening around us. There are obviously some areas where improvement should be made(more of a matter of personal accountability)
::: but consideration of restructuring::: renaming::: and delving into those kind of changes that ""the world "" is demanding::: is not who we are. We need to get back to the principle of being in but not of the world::: and remembering who we are at all times. No where in either of the quotes listed does it say that jumping into name changing::: or any other ""history changing"" activities::: or policies::: are included. If a toe hold is given in this part::: then there is no stopping it from going into other areas....if that happens::: we are done.",Good work 👍,This is a great step::: but it is long overdue. Having a global institution with tens of thousands of students and employees but not having a dedicated team of leaders to advocate for their needs until 2020 (and only after allegations of racism and prejudice) is unacceptable. It wasn't a secret that minority students were struggling at the school before now...why did it take national protests for the campus to decide that it needed to change? And how long will any actual change take? Is this committee just a PR measure? I hate to sound so negative::: but when it comes to racism and students of color::: BYU has taught me not to hold my breath.,Ban the display of the confederate flag on campus::: including dorm rooms.,This is wonderful news and as a BYU alumna I am thrilled. Can we please instead have a focus on fostering our faith in the Parenthood of God and the kinship of humankind? Language matters. Please stop excluding women in your language. As you seek to embrace the black students on BYU campus who suffer more than they should::: why not get on with doing the same for women? Also—not trying to make this about women. This is about black students. It just seems utterly ironic to me to be posting about something so necessary for inclusion of a historically and currently excluded group while simultaneously using language that is exclusionary toward another group of people who are historically and currently excluded.,A large portion of non-white students at BYU are international students::: who often come from low-income families in developing countries and who struggle financially through college at a much::: much higher rate than their American counterparts. And at least while I was there::: BYU's attitude towards us was very unhelpful. For example: the vast majority of financial aid was based on your GPA::: as if students who have to work to put themselves through college can really compete for grades against students who get all their expenses paid for by their parents. So a good first step would be to recognize that BYU should have more income-based financial aid::: especially for international students who cannot apply for US government grants and loans. If you are serious about decreasing racial inequality::: put your money where your mouth is.,It’s the right think to do. To bad Yoeli isn’t available.,It’s not the first time BYU has been through an investigation. During the 1969-70 year the same thing happened,Great step. Put people of color in leadership positions if you want to have equality. In the honor code office too so they can see things from different angles. Five years studying::: and I never been more than just an FHE guy or activities committee while I used to be in the leadership position in my own country. I’m not saying I want one at all::: and not looking for it::: but that will be a great start.,I'll believe it when I see it tbh. And when we get the name changed away from one of the most racist people in the church's history...,Great news::: can we start with renaming the Abraham Smoot Administration building?,How can I follow the findings and progress of this committee?,When will you change the name of your school? Young believed in the Curse of Cain::: after all.,I really hope they make some big changes.,This is great news::: and I really hope they're the right steps to help improve the racial disparity that occurs on campus. It's heartbreaking to hear of how black students have encountered insensitive remarks::: and I know that BYU can do a better job of fostering a safe environment for everyone regardless of skin color.,"In recent days::: I noticed how what is detailed below has become a significant point for growth among us as many in society have engaged in virtue signaling::: or publicly patting themselves on the back for being good to others of a different race:

""Feel proud of yourself when you behave well toward someone of another race.""

It is expressly noted in the article that this pattern of behavior should be specifically avoided in our ongoing pursuance of Christlike nature. When we feel we deserve to congratulate ourselves publicly or privately every time we treat someone of a different race with dignity::: we are engaging in a very real form of racist behavior. In reality::: we should be treating everyone everyday with love and kindness naturally and normally independent and irrespective of the race that child of God belongs to.

And yes I am an alumni.,This procedure should apply to all races.,This is exciting. As apart of educating the student body I would hope that this committee will look closely at the black lives matter group and the website they run and educate the student body on what that group stands for. As an alumni I believe all people need to be treated with respect but the messaging behind this blm group is very detrimental to society and I would hope as a committee will distance themselves from the group . (If anything please read what the blm is about from their website ),At BYU::: there is some systemic racism toward all minority students::: not just blacks. Please include Asians::: Native Americans::: Hispanics::: Filipinos and Polynesians in your discussions. I suspect you’ll be shocked to learn about the racial issues these students have experienced at BYU and Utah in general. You are going to have to acknowledge and confront the teachings of President Kimball vs the teachings of modern day church leaders regarding interracial marriages because this conflict is partly to blame for the way minorities are treated within BYU’s religious community::: particularly when it comes to dating relationships.,"BYU is considered today an equal employment opportunity employer yet for decades administrative:::
staff::: faculty::: and certain student jobs has been predominately and disproportionat
ely held by Caucasian::: the MTC hires through BYU as well and is also predominately and disproportionat
ely Caucasian in staff::: administrative:::
and certain student jobs where policy and organizational attitudes are created and shaped. Group think and exclusion has existed as a result. Independent of the fact that BYU is predominately Caucasian the hiring process must be more inclusive of minority groups::: such as the black student body::: in considering and hiring them in administrative:::
faculty::: and staff positions where organizational attitudes::: culture:::policy and processes are created and shaped. What specific actions will you the Committee recommend to address and begin to change this from top to bottom in order for BYU to truly reflect a more equal employment opportunity practice and culture?

And some of the comments here illustrate how necessary this really is!,So sad to see my beloved BYU caught up in this muck. Might as well put up posters BLM. SMH,"Just some ideas:
1. Add a required cultural awareness gen ed
2. Make racist acts or comments explicitly against the honor code and punishable by the university
3. Ban racist symbols from campus (swastikas::: confederate flags::: etc)
4. Rename buildings named after racist people
5. Hire more BIPOC professors and staff::: have them high positions and in the university management","Maybe moving the Multicultural and International Student Offices to a more prominent::: visible::: accesible location could be a start. They're literally in a corner of the basement of the Wilkinson Center (at least they were there 4yrs ago when I graduated). Maybe incorporate mandatory GE credits on diversity and inclusion. Maybe audit and monitor scholarship and grant allocation to ensure fair allocation removing bias based on race or national origin-\-\or even better::: accounting for those proactively. There is so much more that can be done. Remove barriers that go counter to greater diversity and inclusion-\-\like
outrageous admission deposits put in a 0% escrow account that international students need to pay to be admitted that end up keeping BYU out of reach of less-privileged
international candidates. Empower minorities. Trust them. They are not dumb. They are smart. And they are brave-\-\after all they chose BYU::: despite what that entails for a minority student. You don't have the luxury of having many of them in numbers. As they're in short supply::: they are precious; they are an undervalued stock that does not shine as it should. I hope this committee does not end up being a symbolic move and that some tangible actions come out of it.","I hope you also reach out to faculty you've lost to ask about the impact of racist academia practices at BYU

Marguerite Dreissen comes to mind",Maybe a woman president for BYU? That could start things too.,Affirmative action is racist::: so don't go that route,"Have more Latinos::: Asians::: and Blacks::: and Native Americans on campus.

Make it more international like BYU-Hawaii.","Brigham Young was a racist. The church before 1978 was thick and ripe with racist teachings. It wasn't until lawsuits emerged that in 1978 they became inclusive to POC.

Brigham Young was and always will be a racist.",Make sure you include white voices. Too often counsels like this devolve into white criticism and handouts for minorities (and white liberals indoctrinated to criticize whites are not a white voice). Whites also face racism in the form of racial abuse- treating whites like racists. And race and ethnic studies classes at BYU are built on white criticism and ignore white voices and racism and violence whites face. I took graduate courses at BYU::: I know from experience. Judging from this list::: looks like you have no whites who recognize racism and violence towards white people.,How about starting by changing the name of the Abraham O. Smoot Building.

"A message from President Worthen:

With the tragic deaths of George Floyd::: Breonna Taylor::: Ahmaud Arbery and others over the years::: and the confluence of recent events::: important conversations are happening throughout the nation::: including at BYU.

We extend our love and concern to all members of our university community who are impacted by these events.

We know there is work to do::: on campus and throughout the nation::: for us to better come together::: to address injustice and to truly love one another. It will take sustained effort from all of us to make things better. We remain committed to doing that. We can do that in a unique way at BYU because of our understanding of the important truth that each of us are children of heavenly parents.

BYU stands firmly against racism and violence in any form and is committed to promoting a culture of safety::: kindness::: respect and love.

A call to action with no action doesn't mean much,Jasmine from the First Name Basis podcast says talking about race is a muscle you build up over time. I'm currently in a business ethics class at BYU and we talk about how everybody at BYU wants to be ethical::: but we have to practice talking about ethics and specific ethical scenarios in order to be prepared for when those moments come. I wish we had a similar class about race at BYU. I would take it in a heartbeat. Everyone I know believes every person is equal::: but talking about race is difficult without practice.,"Brigham Young said ""I am a firm believer in slavery."" Change your name.","I suppose if the motto of BYU is “Enter to Learn. Go forth to serve.”::: we know that likely many of our graduates will move throughout the nation and the world. We will meet upon a variety of God’s children.

I left Provo and found myself teaching in a school in Kentucky where I was the minority in the room for the first time in my life. I had to recognize my biases to do my job well and to truly be a Christian. And decades later::: even just this week::: I recognize I could have definitely done it better. But when we know better::: we do better. I wish I would have known more then. Denying that I had any racism in my heart just because I thought I treated everyone fairly was pretty naive::: I now recognize.

My hope is that our elected officials work together to improve policing and take better care of officers too. Partisan bickering isn't going to get us far.

"“If we want liberty from the pandemic for ourselves::: we can only truly get it by making sacrifices to liberate others.”

In today's Deseret News::: BYU associate professor in the Department of Public Health Chantel Sloan outlines important considerations amid this pandemic.

Guest opinion: An epidemiologist’s view on mask-wearing and personal liberty",5/28/2020 19:16,Personally::: I felt the article was a refreshingly calm and kind look at the situation; a perspective considering one's neighbor instead of thinking solely of one's self. I know many will disagree with me and that's fine. What I think is not fine is viciously attacking others and citing personal liberty or any other reason as the justification. Can't we disagree with others without attacking them? How can we say we are following Jesus Christ when we are being contentious or not doing to others what we would want them to do to us? We can be better than that.,I am a physical therapist and lds author. I work with cironavirus patients all day. Your flimsy cloth mask gives you 50% protection. If you go to the grocery store you got to purell gel your hands when your done because your not wearing gloves. It is droplet and contact precautions. You can go to my facebook page to see what I am required to wear. So wear a mask. Be considerate to others,It’s one point if Brie among many. Personally I have started wearing my mask less and less. I am a nurse and wear it all day at work but when I come home-no more. Sick people get quarantined and sick and at risk people wear the mask. Just another opinion.,❤️❤️❤️❤️,"https://

Nothing could be further from the truth. We are trying to defeat a disease which to certain people among us is very deadly. It requires us to think beyond our personal borders and consider others. It's not political.",interesting article.,Oh brother...,Yeah...if you want to wear a mask I'm all for it. Placebos work great at making some people feel like they're doing something.

Sometimes::: having the right balance of restrictions provides us with the most freedom.

This pandemic is practically harmless to children::: flu-level threat to teens and young adults::: and only a major issue for the elderly::: the smokers::: and the generally immuno compromised.

It’s no skin off my (young adult) teeth to wash my hands an extra few seconds::: stand away from others::: and not help the elderly get a large jug of salsa off the top shelf at the grocery store.
The high risk group::: and those living/
interacting with them::: will need to be extra precautious when going out. They need the masks::: constant sanitization::: and to replace gloves as they transition to a new surface/
location.

It’s not a loss of freedom to let cars and school kids cross at a 4-way stop sign instead of charging through::: or to come to a full stop even when the intersection is clear. It shouldn’t be a loss of freedom to act defensively as the quarantine loosens its restrictions.","What does it cost you to wear a mask? If you equate being 'asked' to wear a mask with oppression then you might not have much experience with oppression.

Are road rules and public decency laws also signs of oppression? We follow the rules in respect of each other.

People are still dying of this virus and we could help prevent that with a minor inconvenience to ourselves. Or maybe you could explain your freedom-loving objections to the sick::: dying::: and immunocompromis
ed - I'm sure they'll understand the risk you are taking with their health.",I'm not allowed to post it here::: but there's a picture going around of the side of a surgical mask box warning that it does not prevent the spread of viruses. In the hospital::: we are trained and fitted for N95s. Masks are single use::: per interaction. People are running errands all over town::: touching their masks::: wearing them with one strap off::: visible gaps. There is no solid data to back daily use of masks by the general public. Try opening a Splenda packet with a mask on if you want an eye opening experience. If you can taste a fine powder::: how is a mask stopping microscopic droplets?,Conrad Zolman,"""We must forcibly reduce the liberty of others so that we the state can give you back that liberty when everything is safe.""
Let the people be free and they will make the decision to be safe. Not the state.",Of course this would only be a question for American's and I find it really discouraging that a church page would post something like this given the fact it will likely divide our brothers and sisters.,We have to remember not everyone can wear them for various reasons. I hate that people are judgmental when someone doesn’t wear one. Maybe they can’t! You don’t know! People with autism and anxiety struggle with them and people with breathing problems like asthma. That’s what I hate is people being judgmental and you dont know their situation.,"I’m trying to do some research using only open sources. Has BYU done any studies to determine the true risk of asymptomatic transmission of any respiratory virus?

I recently found a few studies claiming they monitored asymptomatic cases. However::: they only used nasal swabs. That is only a screening test that confirms exposure but not necessarily infection. It definitely didn’t confirm that viruses were being emitted.

I’m looking for a study that captured the breathing of asymptomatic subjects and analyzed how many viral particles were emitted.","Miss Sloan::: if you are truly concerned about liberty::: trust that there are things afoot in the world that will help you and others lose your liberties.
Mask wearing MAY help in some cases of extreme exposure and confined spaces. However::: the garden variety masks we see daily are not adequate for anything but the most rudimentary tasks::: and not worth the paper they are made of.
Perhaps the larger concern here is behavior modification::: like Pavlov's dogs. Combine this with draconian measures to isolate the ""non sick"" and scare them daily with lies and false reporting::: and WE become the ones being conditioned. Conditioned for control. For manipulation. For subjects of those who would exercise unrighteous dominion.
We are alive today because our Wonderful Creator designed us to be adaptive and self maintaining.
I chose to go bare footed::: drink from a garden hose::: ride in the back of pickup trucks::: eat apples right from the tree::: tomatoes from the garden::: share a soda pop::: pet a doggie or three::: swim in a creek::: eat candy i found under the car seat::: and on and on.....
You are welcome to your opinions. As our we. I chose to try to maintain what I can these days by what has served me for decades. I chose not to wear a mask.",It all comes down to consideration for others. Wearing a mask is to protect others from you::: not vice versa. Ignoring these rules is the height of selfishness.,Funny::: nobody objects to places of business requiring shirts and shoes::: but wearing a mask is tyranny....,🙄 funny how this won’t get removed from fb yet other experts saying the opposite are removed or blocked by fb all the time. Gotta keep that fear and control going.,Yes! Masks help the spread of the virus::: so help to save lives! It’s not about you::: it’s about how much you care about others! It’s service! and of course::: washing your hands will help you too! 🙂,My question is why haven’t we been wearing masks previously to prevent the spread of viruses such as the flu or RSV? Or H1N1? Are we planning to wear masks from now on to protect people from the flu?,"More fear-based advice based on typical bad public health science::: the result of which advice is false security::: and misdirected people. By now these ""experts"" should have concluded with all the failed predictions of deaths from opening up::: the 50-85X inflation of deaths (Stanford & USC studies) that the great lockdown was unnecessary::: that instead wise and prudent advice was all that was necessary (Sweden::: S Dakota::: Georgia) in all but perhaps the population-dens

Many cultures like ours wear special clothing as a reminder of the first great commandment to love God with all their hearts. In a pandemic::: wearing a mask is a way of following the 2nd great commandment to love our neighbors.

Even with masks being partially effective::: we can treat it like that overdone starfish on the shore analogy and say ""It mattered to that one"" each time we put on our masks/chuck a starfish back out to sea.",Everyone’s an expert now thanks to google and Facebook! Frankly::: I appreciate his educated point of view.,Jaren G. Sommerfeld “for YOUR safety”🤣,Its truly amazing to see an institution that honors the American Revolution but would never have participated in fighting for freedom itself. BYU is quiet about this. We would never have disobeyed the British and would still be British subjects if we followed BYU's obey::: obey::: obey!,You can wear anything for a mask because it's not about safety. It is about compliance.,Just an opinion. A lot of the LDS world would disagree. 🤷🏼‍♀️,Interesting that BYU is sharing an opinion article from Deseret news. An article that supposes that if some model suggests less people can get sick by wearing a mask that we should do so. Well by that reasoning we should always wear a mask for the rest of time. As more data comes in::: it seems that the CDC shouldn't have ever declared covid-19 a pandemic. An epidemic yes::: but not a pandemic. When it was new and we didn't know what could happen it was right to be careful. But now we know that it's not much different than any other illness. The older::: more frail::: and those with weaker immune systems are more susceptible and are hit harder. This is the same for just about any virus or infection. If the flu is not a pandemic::: then covid-19 shouldn't be considered one any longer in my opinion.,"Exactly! The western world secured democracy during WWII because they sacrificed greatly in terms of lives lost and a whole generation who suffered through the economic results during and after the war.

The same thing is happening today::: only that it is far worse - we cannot actually see the enemy! Wearing a mask is such a small gesture::: no one is asking you to potentially kill yourself in combat. But you sure can kill someone else in case you infect them unknowingly.

We seem to make big speeches about how we would do anything for someone we love. Well::: step up and do that right thing. Everyone in this world has someone they love or loves them.",I love this.

"New 2020 The Wall Street Journal ranking: BYU is No. 1️⃣ in the west::: and No. 4️⃣ in the nation::: for student engagement. 🎉

To address the first 10 or so comments we typically see when talking about this metric::: this ranking is NOT about engagements to be married. We fully understand BYU would be at the top of such a ranking as well. Feel free to still make your engagement-related joke in the comment section::: if you'd like::: but the reality of this ranking is actually pretty important and valuable as you look at what it means for the holistic BYU experience.

For the WSJ's purposes in this ranking::: ""student engagement"" is defined as how connected students feel to their school::: each other and the outside world.

So … in a time when we’re all more physically-separated than ever::: we’re fortunate to still be a part of a BYU community where individuals feel much more connected than most.

From President Worthen:

“You students have the rare opportunity to be part of … a compact society that God has prepared to help you learn and develop Christlike attributes. You are not here by accident. You have been gathered here by God. Whatever your background::: whatever your talents::: whatever your challenges or perceived weaknesses::: you are a vital part of this gathering. You have something to gain from and something to offer in your interactions with those around you.

May each of you recognize and delight in the blessings of being fully engaged in this unique kind of gathering ‘of learners and lifters’ is my prayer.”

COVID killed half a million people (perhaps half that when all the false attributions are filtered out down the road)::: virtually all of which were the same people who are killed each and every year by the garden variety flu::: and which was substantially exacerbated by the lockdowns::: mass quarantining (especially of nursing homes and assisted living facilities etc.) and short-circuitin
g of natural herd immunity.

Let's get this straight: COVID did not ""turn our lives upside down;"" that was accomplished by the mainstream media::: politicians and bureaucrats at the state::: municipal and federal levels.

judge-connors","COVID - 19 turns one's life upside down because they allow it to. Just like BYU mandating masks. The data is very clear when it comes to the ineffectiveness
of cloth and surgical masks. Many studies were done during the height of the pandemic that supposedly proved they worked. The problem with these studies is that none of them were conducted under conditions of a randomized controlled trial::: which has been recognized by scientists & physicians for 50+ years as the gold standard of scientific testing. In these trials::: researchers recruit people and split them into evenly matched groups. They offer one group a certain treatment and another group no treatment. This way when they test for the outcome they have a control group to measure against.

Pre-Covid::: a total of ten ""gold standard""::: randomized controlled tests were done for medical masks. All of them came to the same conclusion... they don't work::: unless you are wearing an N95 mask::: sealed & fitted to your beardless face::: and only then if the wearer is trained on how to use it. All of these studies showed very low effective rates for surgical masks and next to zero effectiveness for cloth masks. You can see the data and the summary of these 10 studies here: https://
wwwnc.cdc.gov/
eid/article/26/
5/
19-0994_article. The medical and science community did not see the need to invest further research funding into doing subsequent tests from that point forward because the results were so conclusive.

Post Covid::: only one randomized controlled test has been conducted on masks (to my knowledge) and was conducted specifically to examine whether masks protected their wearers from the Coronavirus. It was a study out of Denmark published in November of 2020. The results were the same as previous tests::: in that mask wearing ""did not reduce::: at conventional levels of statistical significance::: the incidence of Sars-Cov-2 infection"". See that study here: https://
www.acpjournals.
org/doi/
10.7326/M20-6817.

To this day::: even the World Health Organization says the evidence of mask efficacy is underwhelming: https://

Unless future::: large randomized controlled trials find different results::: the Danish mask study::: matched with its predecessors::: essentially should end the debate of whether surgical masks protect people who wear them outside hospitals (much less cloth masks).

"What happens when women are outnumbered? After years spent analyzing lab and real-life settings to determine what it takes for a woman to really be heard—to truly be perceived as competent and influential—a trio of BYU professors have found the same truth: for women::: having a seat at the table does not mean having a voice.

“Women are systematically seen as less authoritative:::” says BYU Political Science Jessica Preece. “And their influence is systematically lower. And they’re speaking less. And when they’re speaking up::: they’re not being listened to as much::: and they are being interrupted more.”

But there are changes we can make to help women speak up and be listened to more.

MAGAZINE.BYU.EDU
When Women Don’t Speak",4/30/2020 19:55,Samantha Pentz Sandstrom,One thing left out in this study though it was ever so gently touched on: it is my experience that women often make decisions or respond based on not hurting feelings::: being sensitive to the repercussion::: even when doing so conflicts with the facts. When the conclusion that 2+3=5 hurts feelings::: a woman will much more likely than man go with not hurting feelings. Yeah::: with mom's children that might be the right approach::: but outside of that setting::: do that and you lose your credibility and confidence of others and become a deficit.,Rose Elizabeth Elbert,"Loved this. The biggest takeaway for me was the end: men assume they are useful contributors regardless of what groups they are in. And that actually makes them better contributors. Step into your power ladies and don't wait for invitations. Fear of being bossy or that other b-word::: actually make you a worse team member. An epiphany.

Also I have always thought unanimous decisions were way too much work::: I need to reassess.",Feedlot,Yes. Do you think men will read this? 😜🌹,True just about everywhere.,"I remember some painful experiences as ward RS president:::when a sarcastic type brother was our HC ward rep::: and would make derogatory comments aimed at me::: as the only sister at our ward leadership meetings::: and no one in the bishopric said anything in my defense. I remember another meeting when YW and Primary presidents also attended and this brother attacked me again. The Primary president spoke right up::: and said::: Brothers are you letting him talk to her like that?"". I'm grateful now that all ward leadership meetings include all auxiliary presidents::: so no sister is by herself with only brothers.",Sometimes when we speak up we are not listened and very likely to be ignored in the church specially if we point out controversial issues ...,Reneé Schlueter Amanda Bonney Claire Goodwin Jefferson Now we know what those studies we did were for haha,"Love this article!!
My daughter graduated three years ago with her masters of accountancy from BYU. She had a guy tell her straight to her face he didn’t want her in his group.
She graduated magna cum laude in the top 1% off her class. After graduation::: while working in the same city::: he credited her with helping him make it through the program.",Afton Izu Melissa Connor 😇😇,I almost cried reading this. I’m so glad to have a real study that validates my feelings about this.,Abby::: thought you'd find this an interesting read!,Ann Robertson Groo- I found the article and I loved it. Thanks for the head's up.,So good.,"Sadly::: some of my worst experiences with this came as a graduate student in the college of Humanities at BYU. I once heard one of my male colleagues disparage some women in a graduate seminar as ""Turning it into a Relief Society Meeting."" #mansplainersEve
rywhere",Interesting read!,We don't have to be heard by everyone::: just by the people who need what we can give.,Instead of claiming that women are weak and being repressed how about produce research on effective methods of men and women working together despite differences? Oh but that would require ACTUAL RESEARCH WITH ACTUAL RESULTS::: heaven forbid our great professors produce useful things.,"I love how this paper is being paraded because it had the ""right"" conclusions. If it had said anything else it would have been tossed on the pile and forgotten. Classy BYU::: classy.",I mean its the same for men::: personality decides a lot at the table. This article said a lot about nothing. And if its the perception that women are less authoritative that we are talking about then thats mainly because an awful lot of women in business and authority tend to act like vixen and be overly difficult to work with.,Brooke McCauley Callahan,Mediocre white man: Yeah::: but here's an anecdotal story that invalidates your years of data and expertise.,Gissella Del Portillo Garcia Jessica Pérez,"Love the article. I could say that I do strive for this between my wife & I::: as well as with my own daughter. I'm definitely not perfect at it though.

I agree with the fact that our society & culture is broken. There's a need for everyone in general to make changes. For us men::: the majority will need to learn how to listen with real intent to understand::: while also learning how to genuinely appreciate::: love::: & see the positives in others. There's more::: but I don't want to write a novel::: only a short story. 😜

For Women::: it does tend to be more outgoing and fearless::: but I also don't want them to simply forsake their God given talents for charity::: compassion::: tenderness::: etc... Women are absolutely essential to listen and counsel with.",How many general conference talks are by women?,How many mission presidents are women?,The study wasn't what I was expecting given the headline but predicable in any case. I thought someone might have taken on the very difficult question of what happens to other women as a result of women not speaking up about abusive men...i.e. other women end up getting abused.,How many women are on your board of directors?,"am I the only one that sees that in church settings women don't have the priesthood so that automatically puts their ""authority"" in 2nd place?",What a terrific article! It,How? I am a bishops wife and have pleaded for training as we get none::: and no one has listened. I know many bishops wives that would love training for the couple when they are called because there are men that know how to include their wife appropriately as in not sharing confidential things but asking their opinions on church activities for example etc... There are men that exclude their wives from every single thing. If there was training::: the couple would know how to handle the calling together. I feel like I have no voice as I have tried to explain this but it has been brushed off::: like it's of no importance. When a man is called to be a bishop::: it affects his entire family for 5 years. As of now::: we are expected to figure it out with no help. The first year was very tough. I am blessed with a good husband that values my ideas::: but have heard too many sisters in my position that are hurting and I would love to see a uniform training across every stake::: so that every couple does things consistently.,No one ever listens to me. 😆,Dallin Whitaker we were just talking about this.,Interesting. But doesn’t that happen with anyone put into a group of individuals different than they are? For instance::: one man in a team of women? How about one uneducated person in a group of scholars? One pencil pushers in a group of steel workers? Etc.,According to the article I can ignore this article. Lol,Amazing article!! I see this all the time in groups at BYU and elsewhere ::: but the groups I’ve been in where I feel more comfortable (really many of my groups I’ve been a part of in the finance program surprisingly enough) participating even if I am the minority have been amazing experiences for me.,It’s the culture!,This so so true in our stake. We have great spiritual priesthood leaders. Most are Hispanic which is a good thing in our area. However::: woman play little to no role in major decisions such as boundaries changes. Women know their place. It’s been frustrating to me for decades. I’ve always supported the priesthood leaders::: but they are missing out on the nuances and wisdom of their sister leaders.,Fascinating article! Love Professor Karpowitz.,"I think the author is projecting their insecurities. I've attended a class that was filled with women. I was one of only two men in the class. I think the ""problem"" is 99% emotional. Also it isn't accurate. Women are far more expressive than men. It is men that are expected not to complain::: speak-up or agitate. For example there are 20 full-time lobbyists for breast cancer research. There are only 2 lobbyists for prostate cancer::: both are women::: both work only part time on the matter. If you actually look at the data::: men's lives are far worse than women's lives.",These are really insightful comments. I’ll read this article carefully. I’m afraid I’ll owe my wife a big apology.,I was recently trying to explain to my husband how different the talking dynamic is between Sunday school and RS. In Sunday school::: the men jump in immediately on every question and the women don’t chime in. I teach RS and I’ve noticed that the women take more time to think on the question and their reply before they answer (meanwhile the men are off to the races). When I would try to participate in Sunday school::: I would raise my hand (I’m a teacher)::: but the men just shout out::: rapid fire::: one right after another::: and then the teacher moves on to the next question. 🤷🏼‍♀️ I’d guess 90-95% of the talking was from men and id guess the numbers in the room were about 40/60 favoring the men. I did notice a difference when the Sunday school teacher was female. The men raised their hands and the teacher waited more before calling on someone. She seemed to call on women about half of the time. More women raised their hands because she gave time before calling for responses. It’s all very interesting to watch and think about.,I loved this thank you,"Yes::: I have seen this happening in meetings I've been in and it has also happened directly to me in meetings I've been in.
“Women are systematically seen as less authoritative:::”
says BYU Political Science Jessica Preece. “And their influence is systematically lower. And they’re speaking less. And when they’re speaking up::: they’re not being listened to as much::: and they are being interrupted more.”",I have definitely experienced this in BYU classrooms::: at work::: on my mission::: and at church. I am forever grateful for the male BYU professors I had who not only welcomed women’s voices::: but demanded them.,I’m grateful for the female professors I’ve had in my major! I appreciate all of my professors::: but it is so helpful to learn from their unique perspective on finding balance in life::: especially as most people in my major are female 😊,Excellent article!

My first job was not what I expected and was not until a few months after graduation. Look for any opportunity to get in to your field. I started as a contractor through a temp agency as a chemist (degree in chemical engineering)::: a year later turned that in to a full time hire position (using my experience as a temp chemist to get a job as a full time engineer for the same process::: but on an industrial scale instead of a lab)::: and advanced steadily from there.,The degree might get you the interview::: but your ability to solve someone's problems gets you hired.,"From those of us who faced the Great Recession:
- Find out what needs to be done and become an expert in it.
- Make yourself invaluable to those in need of your expertise. Be willing to work harder and smarter than everyone else and be the one that gets the job done.
- Be willing to go down paths you didn’t plan on if that is where the need lies. Ex: my husband graduated in engineering and took a job in state corrections because that was what was hiring. He is now the payroll manager using skills he learned in his business classes.
- Be realistic about what you can tolerate on a day-to-day basis. Being stuck in a job that makes you miserable will hurt you and impair your ability to succeed. But also seize on your strengths and be willing to put in the hard work to advance. Ex: working in a call center was NOT for me! But working in the healthcare administration field fit my skills and talents quite well.",We had 3 kids in our family graduating from BYU this year.

"We’re not saying unlimited screen time is fine for kids::: but new research is showing that kids who’ve grown up with the internet and more technology than others from previous generations are no less socially skilled.

NEWS.BYU.EDU
Is too much screen time for kids making it harder to talk in person?",4/16/2020 21:05,Yes,"The study compared 1998 to 2010::: when kids did not have such a great tablet/
smartphone/
smartv use. These last 10 years have been the cause of many people's concern. I'd like to wait for new studies that include this last decade.",I think it would be interesting to see the effects long term - how do high school and college aged people interact socially after so many years of increased screen time? My goals in parenting are long-term. If my kid isn't reading by 8 years old::: I'm not worried because science says that children who learn to read at 11 and those who learn to read at 5 show now difference in literacy skills by the time they're 12. So I don't really care that there's no difference::: socially::: between a child who is regularly exposed to screen time and one who isn't::: I want to know what science says about adults who were regularly exposed to screen time as children vs those who weren't.,I wrote a paper while at BYU about how communication via technology (whether in realtime or delayed) opens up so many social avenues for populations who can otherwise struggle in that arena::: like Autistic folks! <3,You can definitely find a study to support whatever point of view you have. lol,This presumes talking in person is desirable.,Amanda Budgett Webb,"Not surprised really. Kids have literally always had anti-social outlets they could access. All that matters is who wants to do what.

Both use the same amount of screen time. Two are very social and one isn’t. The one that isn’t has adhd-they are about 3 years behind their peers social behavior.

Classes:

Classes on March 13::: 16 and 17 are cancelled. All courses at BYU::: including its Salt Lake Center::: will resume March 18 through remote instruction. Some courses cannot reasonably meet remotely::: such as lab courses or performance-based courses. College deans will communicate with departments about any specific exceptions.

Travel home:

BYU encourages students to consider leaving campus and returning home to finish Winter semester through remote coursework. We recognize individual circumstances may not allow this. Services and on-campus housing will continue to be available for those who choose to remain.

"In a new study::: researchers from BYU's public health department found that kids playing youth sports consume more calories in post-game snacks than they actually burn during their games.

NEWS.BYU.EDU
Study: Kids eat more calories in post-game snacks than they burn during the game",2/27/2020 17:56,Seriously::: skip the trip!,Duh. You can’t outwork poor nutrition. It’s also something most kids don’t need to worry about.,This is me after the gym 😂😂🤡🤡,Directions unclear: stopped playing sports to avoid eating the post game goodies.,They also get more trophies after the game than they earn during the game.,Actually::: it muscle was gained::: the calories burned overtime might even out.,So do I. It’s so easy to over eat after working out.,My 4 year old’s soccer team does summersaults and chases butterflies the entire game. Of course their cookies and Capri suns are more calories than that.,What happened to oranges and water?,I always hated post snack requirements. I wanted to just do cold water and fruit...,I just want to slow clap for the person who studied this phenomenon in the first place! Well done you!,This generation feeds their kids WAY TOO many snacks. Then they don’t eat the meals which have (or should) the nutrition. But the little snackies are so cute::: the mommies just can’t resist!!,After raising 4 kids I can tell you that kids do not needs snacks all the time. Everyone has gotten into the bad habit that when their kid is a bit hungry they need a snack. Reasons they don’t: 1) It is good for them to feel some hunger 2) it teaches patience 3) It teaches them to appreciate food when they get it. 4) It teaches them what kids throughout the world go through. Of course there are all kinds of exceptions to this and I certainly am not talking about starving your child but if they go hungry for 30 minutes that’s okay.,I could have told you that without a study....,Thank you. Many people on this thread must not realize the unhealthy habits we are teaching our kids with the usual snacks I’ve seen served over and over after youth sports. This study is not about shaming kids for eating a snack::: it is teaching kids to have a good relationship with food and exercise. As a parent and a nurse::: I’ve been horrified at the snacks offered my kids after youth sports. No one needs a bottle of Gatorade (full of sugar)::: Oreos::: or crackers and “gummy fruit snacks” after a workout. I would try to bring water::: popcorn or fruit and I was the “weird parent”. American culture needs to rethink what we are teaching our kids to eat. Childhood obesity is an epidemic.,"And it’s okay. Calories are a unit of energy::: not something to be feared.
Let’s not encourage food fear. It’s NEDA week. Check out some articles on Intuitive Eating instead!",For my daughter's soccer there were half time snacks and after game snacks. We had no snacks growing up. Not sure how it's come to this.,I’m a pediatric dentist and have coached many seasons of basketball::: soccer and flag football. I’m glad to see a study like this come out that supports what I’ve been telling parents for a long time. Thank you!,"It seems like a lot of the comments are focused on the idea of restrictive eating and calorie counting and how that's detrimental to an approach to food in one's life. But I think just as much of the article is focused on replacing empty calories with more nutrient dense foods. That is important::: and not a toxic mindset::: especially in the world of athletics.

It also isn't saying ""never have snacks or sweet foods or enjoy higher-calorie treats."" But to have baked goods and sugary drinks at every sports game isn't exactly helpful or doing the kids a favor.

Also::: it's soooo important to teach good habits to children when they are younger so they don't have to fight for years to undo them in the future. It's so much easier to maintain a healthy weight and healthy habits than to make big changes to your life to lose weight or alter eating habits.",Because post game snacks used to be water and fruit and now they are Pinterest worthy robots built from granola bars::: Gatorade::: candy and junk. Water. The kids need water. Not a 20 ounce blue dyed Gatorade.,Whatever happened to water and orange slices like when I was a kid? I got parents angry with me when I didn’t provide a junk bag full of tons of snacks after a soccer game for my kid.,It's cause we count Billy who just stands half the game unless the ball hits him....,But that’s not necessarily a bad thing!? Depending on where calories are coming from... and how active kids are the test of the week...,And I consume more calories at dinner than I do watching TV afterwards.,Lol so? Not like they need to replenish their energy stores or anything 🙄,"I have a coworker who struggled with eating disorders for many years and she expresses to me a lot how difficult it is to live in this world that preaches CALORIES and BURNING off what you EAT and losing weight. It’s a very toxic mentality to limit yourself what you eat based off what you burn/don’t burn - teaching this to kids at such a young age is just awful. The term “calories” is very vague here in the title - could be coming from spinach for all we know (which is healthy::: yes?). So this study is a bit frustrating to me since it’s very triggering in the eating disorder umbrella. People need to give their bodies food. Kids need to give their bodies food. It’s essential to their mental and physical wellbeing. Some may say “people are just too sensitive about this - it’s just a silly study” but... we are all neighbors here struggling/
dealing with something so let’s put ourselves in their shoes for a moment 💕",I bet they ate more calories at dinner than they expended washing their hands beforehand::: too.,I get worried when I see kids more excited about a snack than a game. Can’t we get through any gathering without food being the point?,Well::: so what. I know that parents consume more calories during post-game brewsky binges.,So not surprised. I hate all the junk food the parents give out. And the quantity is ridiculous!,So what? You think kids play to lose weight?,That's because exercise::: while a good thing::: will never do much in the way of offsetting the calories you intake. 🙄,Yay! Kids love the post game treats! That is at least half the reason why they like to play!,This completely ignores calories burned during practices::: after which kids don't get sugary snacks.,Not sure when orange slices turned into fruit snacks::: chips::: donuts and Gatorade::: but yeah::: the newfound post-game sugar consumption is a joke.,Interesting that during National Eating Disorder Awareness Week this is the article you decide to share. This article is biased::: the study has a relatively small sample size and missing so many other factors. I would be skeptical taking this study to heart and seek other studies and sources that are unbiased and have better research protocols.,Weird thing to do: play a game::: eat a snack then remain perfectly still and inactive the rest of the day. Sounds like kids.,why is this a supersize to anyone?,Growing kids need activities they love but also calories. If they’re facing obesity::: that’s a different issue.,I find it strange how many people are having issues with the study. Kids don't need that much sugar at all the different events they go too. Teaching them to eat healthy snacks instead of them learning to expect snacks that go over the daily recommended amount of sugar is a good thing. And sure::: kids are burning more calories throughout the day but I bet they are eating more sugar too.,So NOT getting McDonald's after playing soccer will help me stay fit? I think we need more research into this.,I can’t stand this trend of having to provide snack bags after the game. When I was a kid it was cut up orange quarters at half time. That’s it. Now everything has to be a big production.,This is interesting research::: but I think you have to be careful with how you're framing it. A few thoughts: 1. While I agree children should choose healthier snacks (fruit::: as suggested in the article)::: post workout is the best time to replenish glycogen stores::: which can be accomplished with simple carbohydrates. 2. I think it's dangerous to get kids and parents thinking about trying to burn more calories in exercise than they consume afterward. That could be a recipe for disordered eating in the future. Young children shouldn't be playing soccer to lose weight. 3. I'd be more concerned about the kids who AREN'T in the game—who might not be developing a healthy sense of enjoyment about physical activity.,I'm still waiting for the study that shows that beards do not affect academic performance in any way.,So...are they not going to move the rest of the day? Kids are amazing intuitive eaters if us adults got out of the way and stopped micromanaging their appetites. So they eat a bit more after the soccer game. They will likely account for that increase in energy intake later in the day by moving more or eating less. Let them be kids.,we've been volunteering to coach city sports for almost 10 years now and I completely believe this!,"It is me. I am ""kids.""",Kids are growing::: they need the calories,Well::: that would also mean that as a parent::: I probably don't burn as many calories from watching them play as I thought—and I should probably stop stealing their Sunny D at halftime.,"Same with people and the gym. ""I just jogged for 3 miles. Now I need my 600 calorie post workout shake and bar.""",Eat more water,Melanie::: BYU has justified our hatred of post game meal-snacks.,Oranges.,So?,"1. It’s pretty sickening to calorie count CHILDREN
2. Snack Culture? It’s called being hungry
3. God forbid they EAT","Positive Nutrition with Paige Smathers::: RDN. -
We need expert weigh in on this... so damaging.",Robert Dale Smith another reason to stop snacks!,Trina Rush Burdge definitely true lololol,"As a therapist who specializes in treating individuals with eating disorders/
disordered eating::: I find so many problems here (both in the study and in the article published by BYU)::: it’s hard to know where to begin. Here goes::: in no particular order:

1. Just to get this one out of the way: “Kids are getting inundated with snack culture all the time.” Snack culture?? A culture in which children eat snacks? And that’s a bad thing?

2. The “finding” looking at calories burned vs. calories eaten. Focusing on this finding perpetuates a huge issue that really DOES have negative impacts on health: the idea that movement is about earning or compensating for food. This idea is disordered. Whether or not the study was specifically trying to say that kids should consume the exact number of calories they burned (or fewer) to be healthy::: the fact that the study was using this metric to draw conclusions about the health of youth in sports is problematic.

3. This quote: “So many kids are at games just to get their treat afterwards::: which really isn’t helping to develop healthy habits long term:::” Spruance said. “The reward should be::: ‘I got to have fun::: I got to run around with my friend or score a goal.’” More problems here. First of all::: vilifying eating for pleasure is a slippery slope into more disordered ideas. If having “treats” becomes a bad thing::: we’re introducing shame into a perfectly normal part of eating. Shame about eating can lead to disordered eating. Eating can be fun::: can be social::: can be pleasurable::: and still be “healthy” because food is not JUST fuel::: and health is not just about food or weight. Food is fuel::: and the type of fuel we give our bodies does matter::: but we are also built to enjoy eating for many purposes::: not just to balance energy expenditure. Furthermore::: having food be a fun part of playing sports does not detract from the other rewards of sports::: as the author seems to imply in this quote.

4. The whole design of the study (as well as its sample size) is problematic if it is being used to create interventions or recommendations
for youth sports. The study essentially took a tiny snapshot of a child’s activity levels and eating::: and concluded that there was a problem because kids ate more than the recommended daily intake of sugar::: plus an “extra” 43 calories. This type of fragmented view is also an example of a perspective that is edging on disordered. Our bodies are resilient and flexible when it comes to eating. As has been recommended::: please see the research on intuitive eating. The books Anti-Diet::: by Christy Harrison::: and Intuitive Eating::: by Evelyn Tribole and Elyse Resch::: are great starting points. If we look at ANY tiny snapshot of a day and try to compare calories burned vs. calories eaten as a marker of health::: we won’t get the full picture. There is nothing wrong with inviting parents to bring a greater variety of foods to the post-game snack::: but there IS a problem with fear-mongering about food based on findings from tiny moments in the lives of a tiny sample size of kids.

Vilifying sugar::: vilifying “treats:::” vilifying snacks::: reducing food to output vs. intake::: focusing on calories in both eating and exercise::: fear-mongering about obesity… SO many problems here::: and many of them in the realm of disordered eating.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Keep it up Cougs!,An amazing game! BUT I was so disappointed in the BYU students. They were on national TV shouting and acting so rudely. The posters and obnoxious banners were uncalled for. When I attended BYU we were asked to stand apart from the world-to be unique. President Wilkerson would be very upset. We can win without the childish antics!,It was an awesome game. I was so proud to be a Cougar. I am so happy for this team who has overcome so much adversity this year.,That was an amazing game!! We were screaming at the tv!’,Kudos for finally beating Gonzaga. However::: why storm the court? But I can’t say much more::: Utah beat you and Kentucky and we still play sub-.500 basketball.,Baylor had already lost to Kansas::: so the Zags were essentially the number one team fighting to maintain their number one spot. They mentioned that at the start of the broadcast.,Yay! And you'all did it with so much talent. Gonna miss the Seniors. Congrats!!!,Hope to see BYU in March Madness.,I don’t think people realize how huge of a win it was last night ! If BYU lost they probably would have dropped out of being ranked !

Nice company…,"Absolutely loved it! Congratulations
!",Congrats to BYU for a great game. My only complaint is questionable sportsmanship. I don’t care for the taunting and distracting student display behind the basket on every free throw. I was also unhappy that some Cougar fans threw things onto the court. BYU should display better sportsmanship than that!,Great game! Although since my family has alumni ties to both schools::: I am excited for BYU but sad for Gonzaga. 🙂😢,"TJs baby is our good luck charm::: just saying #haventlostsince

"The power of positivity.

BYU researchers in the BYU McKay School of Education spent three years observing elementary school teachers::: in 151 classrooms::: in three different states. They found by praising::: instead of reprimanding::: teachers saw up to a 30 percent increase in students’ focus in the classroom.

Or in the words of the researchers::: the higher the teachers’ praise-to-reprimand ratio::: the higher the students’ on-task behavior percentage.

I've only taught Sunday School from 7 years old up to the 16-year-olds. It holds true at any age.,I taught preschool for years. I had one class that fought constantly. A few kids were always excluded or bullied. I started doing a daily “sunshine friend”. I would choose a different child every day. All the teachers and aides would watch that child and write down good things they witnessed. At the end of the day we would publicly recognize that child and all the good things we saw. Soon the kids were looking for good things in everyone. Instead of tattling they would tell the teachers when they saw good things. And they began to praise each other. At the end of the year we had an amazing class where the kids wanted to be together and to learn. They tried to do what was right and help each other. Best class ever!,"Landon Soelberg

"Things we've noticed that people have a lot of opinions about here on our social media accounts: BYU Football::: beards::: Disney princesses::: caffeinated soda ... and apparently now milk.

Not a surprise for this study's author::: exercise science professor Larry Tucker:

“Milk is probably the most controversial food in our country:::” Tucker said. “If someone asked me to put together a presentation on the value of drinking milk::: I could put together a 1-hour presentation that would knock your socks off. You’d think::: ‘Whoa::: everybody should be drinking more milk.’ If someone said do the opposite::: I could also do that. At the very least::: the findings of this study are definitely worth pondering. Maybe there’s something here that requires a little more attention.”

It’s really not all that healthy. We drink whole milk and have less stomach issues.,This is only an indirect correlation.

They also exercised more::: lived in safer neighborhoods::: drove safer cars::: and could afford better healthcare. In the end::: they lived nine years longer. The professor notices a correlation where those who drank skim milk lived longer. He then credits the skim milk for the whole nine years.

"Needless to say ... the past decade at BYU had A LOT.

From Old Spice parody and fictitious goaltender face trauma to Jimmermania and the Miracle at Memorial. From Vocal Point on The Sing Off to Cosmo and the Cougarettes going super viral. From #BYUHalloween to the Freshman Y. From No. 1 rankings to a new BYU president. From researching superhydrophic surfaces to Disney princesses to fireflies to helicopter parenting to bulletproof origami ... and a lot more.

"The road to adulthood—whatever that means—has never been longer. BYU researchers say a few things have changed dramatically in the last 25 years about how young people transition to adulthood. Today’s young adults are hitting traditional adult milestones (landing full-time jobs::: marrying::: having kids) later than any of their predecessors have.

Read more in the link below on what emerging adults can do to navigate this sometimes difficult period.

MAGAZINE.BYU.EDU
Why are young people struggling with adulthood?",12/20/2019 17:59,Look at the parents who raised them.,"I think it's more apt to say that people ""in Utah"" may be having trouble hitting the ""Utah adult milestones""::: namely getting married when you're 18 or 21::: having kids when you're 22::: and so forth. The rest of the world doesn't necessarily do things so quickly.

Here's the thing: not all of us wanted to ""treat our 20's as an adult playland"". I wanted to get married and have kids in my 20's. It was really frustrating to see everyone go on to this so called ""adulthood"". I didn't have my ""career"" until I was 31 when I became a Registered Nurse. I was trying to have a career doing other things but it wasn't panning out. But in my 30's::: I established a solid career::: found a great woman::: got married and started having kids. Now we also own a home.

But just because you are technically doing all the adult things now doesn't mean you can't do the things you loved as a kid. I still play guitar in a rock band.

Your life is YOUR life. It's not going to be the same as everyone else's. An adult is just a grown human. Just because you don't own a home or have kids or go to bed at 9 pm doesn't mean you are irresponsible or ""not an adult"".

Do what you want and life the life you want to. If you don't want to get married and have kids::: don't! It's a big sacrifice::: and you have to really want it.

Would I be sad if I didn't have my wife and kids? Yes::: it would be lonesome. But I hope I would look at the bright side of it all. I'd have more money and freedom to travel::: try different things::: move around.

Sometimes things work out to where you have the happy marriage::: kids::: house and all that. Sometimes it doesn't. I volunteered at a homeless shelter where I helped young families with 2-3 children::: just grateful to have a place to stay and some toast and coffee to eat for breakfast.

There is a good part of life that is beyond our control. Love and marriage don't always work out like we want them to. Maybe we need to be more willing to give people a chance. Maybe we have unrealistic expectations. Who knows? Just be honest with yourself::: what you want out of life::: and go get it.","Great ideas here. But I would also hope that the church (both the formal organization and the culture) would stop treating YSAs like kids. When I was in the RS president YSA ward at age 30::: we were required to have chaperones on an overnight temple trip to another city. When I asked if I could be on the of the chaperones::: I was told no::: *per the handbook*::: the chaperones had to be married people (and who ended up being younger than us...so basically sending the clear message that only married people were full adults who are able to control themselves.) I have many more examples like this from my experiences as a YSA all over the country.

If the church is serious about helping YSAs move into adulthood::: then there should be a greater effort especially in family wards to give YSAs greater responsibility by for example considering them for ""big"" callings and making sure their viewpoints and perspectives are considered and listened to. It can be very discouraging) and frankly alienating) to have responsibility and be trusted in worldly contexts like at work and then come to church and be told and treated as if you aren't a full adult and thus don't matter unless you get married.",Eleisha Oviatt This is by my human development professor. Looks interesting!,They finally got smarter than previous generations and realized there is no need to rush into the heavy burdens of life.,Colleges are offering an “how to adult” class because this is so common,I can commiserate,Emerging adulthood is good.,Interesting how this article does everything but explain why this “emerging adulthood” is something to be avoided. It’s written from the perspective of older researchers who think their way of life was the only good way.,Interesting😑,Everything is done for them . My kids all worked in high school . Every kid did . And you were responsible for your own health care at 18. When you got married you paid for your wedding. And college.,"The ease of the way. And I'm guilty of this. Carving out a life and carving out of yourself a better person is no job for wimps. But why do it when you don't have to?

We are blessed beyond measure. The common person has access to better food::: better transportation:::
finer things than all the kings of the earth up until the last century. Adulthood is a call to responsibility and its hard to not expect the world for doing nothing when that is how so many of us came into this life.

Props to every parent who makes work vital in all they are teaching their kids.",Monique Marie I haven’t had a chance to finish reading this. But it reminded me of our conversation this week!!!,Yes::: but they get to learn algebra in 3rd grade! 😂,"I wish anthropologists
could be more valuable to these kinds of researches. This is not just a psychological or sociological change::: it is cultural. Culture needs to be understood in all aspects of life to be able to understand this topic. What it means to be an adult? How adulthood was seen in the past? How it is seen today? The article kind of states that adulthood means to have a full time job::: married and kids. It is just a way of seeing things based on perspectives from the past. I think there is too much pressure on young adults. That’s the problem. In the past they had just one vision of things: life was to get married::: have kids and work. But now this globalized and multiculturalis
m world changes the way things are seen. So the transitions need to be well understood::: but again::: culture needs to be understood too. If you would ask me what adulthood is I would probably say: be responsible for your own actions::: put priorities first::: sacrifice your time::: money and talents in behalf of others::: make clear and reasonable decisions::: live a life to meet your professional goals (I would never say in order to be an adult have kids). So many different subcultures::: that’s why it is very complex to generalize a result. I am 29 years old::: 2 kids::: and sometimes I don’t feel I am a complete adult like my parents and their friends used to be in the past. So. 🤷🏻‍♀️",Jill Ashby Binns GREAT read,I know for me::: it took a bit longer because of the push to finish my education and start a career. We got married after we both graduated and in the 6 years we have been married::: we have had to live with my spouse's parents twice. Housing costs way more than it used to::: higher education too. Plus having a healthy pregnancy and uncomplicated unmedicated birth for both my girls cost us a combined $7:::000 with insurance! Almost double what the insurance had told us. I don't know if we will have any more kids just based on the cost. In the neighborhood we live in::: it cost $80:::000 to build a home here in 1991. Houses are now being sold for almost $300:::000 for a home that is considered a first family home. School in my parents time could be paid by working in the summer. I worked the entire time just to pay rent::: car insurance::: and phone with not much left over besides a plane home for the holidays. Plus when my parents had kids::: I cost them a total of $100. So yes::: we waited because everything costs a ton. I recently tried going back to work::: but it wouldn't have been worth it because I'd be paying most of my paycheck to a babysitter. *Sigh*,Thanks Larry Nelson. Means more to me now that I've got teenagers. Finances are a huge part of this as you say. Also::: that dynamic where parents now try to delay their kids on marriage feels like a complete reversal from how things used to work.,I mean. Adulthood ain't what it cracked up to be anymore lol,Do y'all have a letter to the editor.,By the way. I hope someone who published this article read this.,Michael Rayback We’ve discussed this a lot. Matthew Rayback,Adults have careers? Do you know how many 30 or 40 somrthings work at Wal-Mart. Either it is because they can't afford college::: college isn't for them or the way there lives just turned out. Do you think they consider that a career? Probably. But if you are an adult with a job you are doing good.,Plus do you know some cultures encourage adult children and parents to live together or live close by. This article is too Americanized,Have y'all ever though that one of the reasons why young adults are having a faith crisis because of this constant pressure to get married. Well at least LDS people I mean. Stop pressuring us. You are so annoying. That is what leads us into depression and low self-esteem. Come on now. This is what I am saying LDS people sometime live in a bubble. Maybe they should marry later for they can have time to get out of the bubble. No missions don't count.,Because some of our parents our poor. And only BYU will think young adults marrying in their late 20s and early 30s as a bad thing. Y'all need to stop pressuring young adults to get married.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

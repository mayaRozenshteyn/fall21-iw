The Virginia Tech community is invited to join President Tim Sands for his sixth State of the University Address on Wednesday::: Jan. 19 at 1:30 p.m.  The address will take place at the Moss Arts Center::: Virginia Tech with a virtual option for those who are unable to attend in person.  Get all the details. ‚¨áÔ∏è  WED::: JAN 19 AT 10:30 AM PST 2022 State of the University Address,2022-01-04 15:31:56,I think President Sands needs to address how Virginia Tech is going to waste all these precious Covid tests on the unvaccinated BUT healthy? This is not fiscally responsible or even scientifically responsible. Testing of the asymptomatic goes against what the CDC says and now::: there are no tests to be found anywhere for those that TRULY need it.  I don‚Äôt really need anybody to comment on my comment - as a parent or student or alumni or employee or pro-vax or anti-vax or just plain monetary donor::: you should have the same exact question!,Moss Arts Center::: Virginia Tech::: Institute for Creativity::: Arts::: and Technology - ICAT & Virginia Tech College of Architecture and Urban Studies collaborated to terminate my employment for reporting being sexually assaulted by senior faculty emeritus Virginia Tech School of Visual Arts Ray Kass::: and covered it all up. https:// docs.google.com/ document/d/e/ 2PACX-1vStYq3gIW FqLv9a2NKYhZTTc H4CLPV4cjcvSlqb MFV3cOV14unzmUR 8lS4gBp7M23LElT cMTaSI7q8t/pub,Read what the new attorney general elect said. Time for VT to drop mandates GOVERNOR-ELECT YOUNGKIN AND ATTORNEY GENERAL-ELECT MIYARES TO CHALLENGE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE & MEDICAID SERVICES‚Äô VACCINE MANDATE  RICHMOND::: VA ‚Äì Governor-elect Glenn Youngkin and Attorney General-elect Jason Miyares today announced their intent to challenge the unconstitutiona l vaccine mandate imposed by President Biden‚Äôs Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).  ‚ÄúThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused heartbreaking health::: societal::: and economic loss and suffering throughout the Commonwealth and the United States. Our children have experienced severe learning loss and developmental challenges that will last decades::: strained and stressed hospital systems are suffering from an historic staffing crisis::: and a crippled supply chain has driven up Virginians‚Äô cost of living.  ‚ÄúInstead of supporting state and local governments‚Äô efforts to protect the lives and livelihoods of their citizens::: the Biden administration has resorted to unlawful vaccine mandates that force hardworking Virginians to walk away from their paychecks. President Biden's CMS mandate::: ignores the hospital systems' long-establishe d policies designed to keep staff and patients safe and threatens the tenure of essential medical personnel at a time when staffing shortages threaten the health and safety of Virginians.  ‚ÄúWhile we believe that the vaccine is a critical tool in the fight against COVID-19::: we strongly believe that the Federal government cannot impose its will and restrict the freedoms of Americans and that Virginia is at its best when her people are allowed to make the best decisions for their families or businesses.  ‚ÄúAfter the January 15th inauguration::: the Commonwealth of Virginia will quickly move to protect Virginians‚Äô freedoms and challenge President Biden‚Äôs unlawful CMS::: OSHA::: and Head Start vaccine mandates. Removing some of the staffing barriers to our hospitals::: will provide much needed relief for our overworked medical professionals.‚Äù,this place is magic at any season,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A message from President Tim Sands with three important steps the Virginia Tech community is required to take as we turn to the spring semester. ‚¨áÔ∏è  VTX.VT.EDU From President Tim Sands: Booster shots::: tests::: and masks required for spring semester start,2021-12-28 16:30:02,For FAQs about public health requirements at Virginia Tech::: please visit https:// ready.vt.edu/ faq.html,DO NOT COMPLY - THIS IS WRONG - IT IS UNSCIENTIC::: UNETHICAL AND COMPLETELY MEDICALLY UNNECESSARY FOR HEALTHY COLLEGE AGED STUDENTS. NOW IS THE TIME TO TAKE A STAND - IF ENOUGH OF YOU REFUSE TO COMPLY IT WILL STOP. ALL STUDENTS WHO WERE COERCED INTO GETTING THE VACCINE AGAINST THEIR WILL IN THE FIRST PLACE AND DO NOT WANT OR NEED A BOOSTER SHOULD CONTACT THE SCHOOL ADMINISTRATION TO PUT PRESSURE ON THEM TO DROP THIS REQUIREMENT. YOU SHOULD ALSO CONSIDER FILING EXEMPTIONS AND/OR LAWSUITS AND CONTACT THE INCOMING GOVERNOR ELECT GLENN YOUNGKIN AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL MIYARES IMMEDIATELY. ALSO CONTACT YOUR STATE DELEGATES AND STATE SENATORS. PARENTS AND STUDENTS WHO ARE AGAINST THIS MUST JOIN TOGETHER NOW.,What if a vaccinated student tests positive over break but has no more symptoms? How‚Äôs testing handled given that you can continue to test positive for a while after?,Let‚Äôs go Hokies,Is this really a surprise? Jim Ryan at UVA sent the same booster requirement email/message to students::: parents and faculty on 12/21 and we all know that both universities have similar protocols so we knew this was coming.,I wonder what will happen when we get a new Virginia AG‚Ä¶,Good job Tech! That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm proud to be an alumna‚Ä¶,When I went to Tech we protested the Vietnam War. Now students and parents are protesting science. Progress?,Everyone I know with Covid now had three shots::: and studies are showing the booster ‚Äúlasts‚Äù only ten weeks. Even without a booster::: having two shots still prevents severe illness. When does this insanity end???,Very disappointing decision by VT leadership.,What a joke. When will this madness end?,This is ridiculous. There‚Äôs no rapid at home tests to be found and the only tests you can get at clinics are the ones that take 3+ days to come back. Or pay upwards of $200 for a rapid test. If they‚Äôre vaccinated they shouldn‚Äôt need a dang test!,"My son transferred for spring semester. So glad to say ""adios::: President Sands!"". Good luck to everyone.",I'm so glad Sands wasn't President when I went to VT...,It will never be enough. The bar just keeps moving and moving and moving........,Sure sounds like a ton of spoiled brats on here wanting to act like adults and make their own decisions. They can start by being adults and respecting the decision of the school made for the safety of all students::: faculty::: and staff!! Grow up!!,Sounds like it‚Äôs time for a new President.,Glad I don't go to school anymore. This is nuts.,Good for tech! Already got my booster! üò∑,What if we currently have a covid positive student. They can‚Äôt test for 3 months. Also he is vaccinated so...I‚Äôd rather he keep his natural immunity for 3 months instead of getting another jab which didn‚Äôt protect him in the first place. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,Unbelievable. VT forcing vaccines::: midyear::: no less. Sad. It's a personal decision for so many reasons.,I am a Virginia Tech hokie and I also work in HOUSEKEEPING to make sure your adult kid is safe 8 hrs a day,All the people angry-reacting LOOK like they would be angered by this news announcing that one has to be considerate of their community,Just here for the comments. Sad to see so many showing their ignorance.,No surprise! This will last the rest of the year! ü§£ü§£ü§£,I am appalled that an institution for higher education is so uneducated as to the science of Covid. Tech has become Woke. Making decisions based on fear and power,Very disappointed in VT. Are they going to take responsibility for any severe reactions to the shots even death. Will they compensate these potential families. It is very rare for someone under thirty to have a serious reaction or death from ChinaV in general.,What a joke. Double down what‚Äôs already not working. ü§®,Umm‚Ä¶there are 0 tests available in NC and elsewhere! Plus::: depending on when students got their last shot::: they might not be eligible for booster yet. How‚Äôs this going to work??üôÑüôÉü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,Tech is officially being ran by bureaucrats. Two weeks before you return Sands dictates vaccine booster requirementsüò°,Ummm. We‚Äôre a science school. Polytechnic even. If you want to join a death cult::: go to Liberty.,This is absolutely ridiculous. My sons has had Covid and the ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù and now needs a booster!!! Oh and wear a mask because the shots don‚Äôt really work.,Absolute disappointment. Teaching our young people to be sheep. Hasn‚Äôt the past month proven to you that the Vaccines don‚Äôt work (omicron) and don‚Äôt help the young. Additionally you are completely discounting the impact of a positive test. Where is the science in that?,For those who don‚Äôt want to get a dangerous and unnecessary booster::: file for a religious exemption. It is YOUR choice to get a vaccine and you should NEVER be forced into that decision. I am ASHAMED of this school‚Äôs administration for requiring this.,Will never give another dime to this school. Paid my last tuition payment and will never donate after this fiasco. I hope others do the same.,A lot of ‚Äúboohoo‚Äù‚Äòs in this comment section. Good for a science/ engineering heavy school to enforce real science mandates.,I know VT isn‚Äôt exactly up there with top notch medical research::: but maybe a Dr or researcher could stretch their imagination to maybe do some research on the previously accepted scientific idea of ‚Äúnatural immunity‚Äù before kids are given yet another dose. I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs still a thing. üôÑ,I will say::: I‚Äôm vaccinated and have had Covid twice since August now and attend VT. I just got over Covid the second time around. It‚Äôs still transmissible::: but the symptoms are lesser. I for one::: living on campus::: don‚Äôt want to have to worry about dodging my friends because they‚Äôre sick::: so if they test negative and have no symptoms then it should be all good::: but if they‚Äôre sick and just come back it‚Äôs risking a lot for us because then we risk going virtual- which NONE of us want to do‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a sad situation honestly. We‚Äôve already heard that GWU is going all online for the spring semester and a lot of the people on my floor of my dorm hall have already sparked concerns about that alone. None of us want to be virtual::: it‚Äôs so hard and straining on our mental health. If taking certain precautions will prevent us from having to go online::: we‚Äôre fine to do it.,Since there is ‚Äú no Federal solution ‚Äú ::: how will the above mentioned measures do any good ? They are the same things the Feds tell us to do .,From my Hokie daughter. ‚ÄúThe parents need to stop getting so angry and let their adult children make their own decisions about these measures‚Äù,Here are the numbers so you can see the reasoning. This is good policy.,No wonder there is a shortage of tests for people that need them when compulsory testing is required for thousands.,This is what concern for students::: faculty and staff looks like. This is leadership.  #utprosim,Can we just not and say we did.,If you believe students at this university are so intelligent::: why don't you give them the opportunity to make the best decisions for themselves?,Literally what‚Äôs next? Booster #2? 3? 17? Do y‚Äôall not see a trend here?,I‚Äôm so done with this administration,Ridiculous. Ignores natural immunity::: low risk to students::: low efficacy of shots::: far reduced severity of virus and individual choice. And other colleges that didn‚Äôt require have done just fine.,So much for FREEDOM,Good job VT. It‚Äôs been awhile since I was a student there::: but I had to show proof of vaccines when I registered. To protect myself::: and the other ~ 28:::000 students (at the time) plus faculty and residents of Montgomery Co. Many don‚Äôt realize how large the faculty is. Not everyone is 18-25 in good health. Students don‚Äôt just go from housing to class and back. Montgomery county is not a wealthy county. Nearly 20% live in poverty::: nearly 1 in 10 (under 65) has no health insurance. So while Covid may not impact your son or daughter::: someone your child passed it onto may not have the same means or health to overcome it so easily. I guarantee your child doesn‚Äôt want to go back to virtual learning. I hope students get a better grasp of science and public health in their years as a Hokie than some parents seem to have.,Proud of my Alma Mater,Y‚Äôall are about to have a drastic drop in students leaving and faculty quitting,This is fantastic. It's also nothing new. I went to Tech in the early-mid 90's and I was almost booted from campus becasue of a clerical error (exact date of my shot as an infant was unclear) on my MMR vaccine records. In the end::: I had to get an additional vaccine shot to stay on campus::: not because I was in reality any less vaccinated::: but becasue of the clerical error. I just did it. Yes I thought it was dumb and sort of bureaucratic::: but these rules are in place for the public good. In my case it probably didnt make a huge difference but the rules are there to ensure that it will make a difference in some cases.,"My entire family is ""vaxxed"" and all of us got covid (delta). It's not a ""vaccine""::: it's a therapeutic. Yes we didn't die::: but still had same severe symptoms. It doesn't prevent anything.  Omicron is milder. Goes away more quickly. Stop the madness.",I applaud the strong leadership at Tech::: and am deeply grateful. I know my student is safe. Thank you.,January 15th can‚Äôt come soon enough.,A little protection is the best direction... protect others & you protect yourself... One rotten apple in a basket may yield a casket....,VT used to believe in science...smh.. .,And the same people screeching about vaccines and masks would be pissed if they had to move back to virtual due to infection rates. ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,Maybe Tech can work to get the vaccine to high risk and disadvantaged populations instead of requiring it for low risk college kids. Tech is Ut Prosim for $$$$$. Above all else keep it rolling in.,UVA did the same. I‚Äôm sure most universities will do the same. Many businesses are also requiring the same. If you are transferring your kid due to a vaccine mandate good luck. When the school you transferred your kid to rolls out the same measure are you going to pull your kid out of that school too?,Virtual instruction can never happen again. That is all we know.,Good to see some common sense. Stay angry::: covidiots.,Disappointing to say the least,Go to a different school.,Since the vaccinated could be a host::: why are we continuing to booster our children? Are we going to continue iignoring natural immunity?? You should be producing independent thinkers and let each individual make their own decision so disappointed in Virginia Tech,Such a shame on VT. As its graduate::: I am saddened by how this place has been ruined by Democratic fearmongering. It used to have the spirit that respects human liberty.,I wonder if we do a FOIA request::: how much funding has VT accepted from Pfizer::: Moderna::: NIH and J and J???,Change your message to stressed out kids who can‚Äôt find a test anywhere. It‚Äôs not right::: fair or moral to stress out these kids with this kind of messaging when the tests aren‚Äôt available.,Well what I talked to Youngkin before the election. He is going to rescind all emergency / executive order for jabber mandates,Nope!!! You are not forcing my kid to be injected with anything else!!!,Virginia Tech has become a woke joke!,What a joke of a school.,What is the protocol for students who cannot get a booster because they are too early (not eligible) in the booster cycle. If some students did not receive their booster until August::: which VA Tech allowed them to do::: they won‚Äôt be eligible for a booster until April. Tech has a Feb 1 deadline. What happens to those students? Will there be accommodations for them?Pharmacies check to see your last vaccine date.,No Covid testing appointments open before my child has to be back at school. How will you remedy this problem.,Ah yes. Money::: and pushing the liberal agenda is what VT has come too.  Recently confirmed by science and facts::: just as they preach.,The deadline is 2/1. Two weeks AFTER classes start. Sorority recruitment has been moved to online.  Strongly suspect next communication is classes remote for first two weeks until 2/1.,Like deaths are so low that there‚Äôs almost no chance of death. There‚Äôs has no been very little covid + across campus and yet we still need them.,Hey VT::: here at Sterrett Facilities to get my covid test‚Ä¶no swabs no staff::: no nothing! Is testing canceled due to inclement weather?,By spring::: we will realize what some scientists have been saying for some time‚Ä¶ we can‚Äôt escape Covid. The goal is to push getting it to the right until it becomes less dangerous. Hopefully by ‚Äúpi‚Äù we realize that everyone will have had it or will get it. Then we can treat it like the flu and go on about our lives.,But it is obvious Covid doesn‚Äôt spread at athletic events based on the complete lack of mask enforcement at the last basketball game I went to in Cassell. The hypocrisy is astounding.,All of you complaining about the mandates‚Ä¶ college is a privilege not a right. So if you don‚Äôt wanna follow the rules::: don‚Äôt go. And if you think it IS a right then I‚Äôm sure you advocate for free or affordable education::: right?,Good move.,Tim Sands? Can you find a test?,How do we upload test results? And if an at home antigen test do we take a picture of the test kit with the results and upload?,Sounds like most of the pro people are anti freedom as well,I love being told I have to get a booster that only provides 33% protection against a mild variant. I was already planning to get the booster but was waiting for an updated version::: not one designed to target the wild variant.,Lol::: you actually thought you were fully vaxed ü§£ü§£::: this is what happens when you don't fight big pharma.,Not the school I went too!!,Devon Stosser,Katie Tyndall,Dylan Quinn,üôÑ,üôÑ,Joe Puleo Sam Moser,You call yourself an institute of higher learning and are condoning this nonsense? So ashamed,How sad that so many people who‚Äôs kids go to a science based school don‚Äôt believe in or understand science.,Boosters for what the common cold we have every yearü§£common sense,I‚Äôm just here looking at all the comments::: likely from people who were never students at tech::: laughing about how grieved some of these people are who don‚Äôt even have a dog in this fight‚Ä¶.,I forgot to mention : Not only does the booster have no positive affect but its efficacy only lasts 10 weeks. https:// www.nytimes.com/ 2021/12/23/ health/ booster-protecti on-omicron.amp. html,Horrible,So all of you whining about a covid vaccine::: did you or your student get the mandatory meningitis vaccine prior to starting?,Thank you President Sands.,Good,They are proven to not be effective.

Since the beginning of the pandemic::: Michael Mulhare from Virginia Tech Emergency Management has been at the forefront of the university's response to the virus.  Mulhare's leadership and dedication to the health and safety of our community has been exceptional since he arrived at Virginia Tech in 2008. ‚¨áÔ∏è  VTX.VT.EDU Michael Mulhare recognized for service and leadership during Virginia Tech‚Äôs COVID-19 response,2021-11-12 15:00:02,Perhaps it is time for health administrators like him to seriously reconsider and reevaluate the mandatory masking policy based on current data on the dashboard. Low weekly case numbers (on campus) and a decreasing severity (an overwhelming percentage of the student body and professors are vaccinated) suggest these measures are no longer needed and can be loosened. The university enforced the measures they felt they needed to early on::: but at this point these measures are becoming increasingly unnecessary. Especially considering their predications on contradictions (a small grad-level class of 4 people is a health risk::: but a full football game is not). Most places in Blacksburg do not require masks and despite that there hasn‚Äôt been a surge in cases amongst Tech Students going to and crowding in TOTS::: Kroger::: or other local bars and businesses. People say ‚Äúlook at the county data‚Äù::: but Tech numbers::: despite the fact that Tech students interact with the Townies and visit stores and restaurants around the county (often without a mask)::: have not gone up much. Also one cannot ignore the large numbers of students openly ignoring the mandate in Newman and while walking around in the dining halls::: the measures at this point are just being increasingly disregarded (and despite that::: the numbers are still low). At this point the available mask infrastructure doesn‚Äôt help the matter either; if students forget or accidentally drop their masks there is no other alternative but for students to pick a used one off the ground (which I have observed that many are already doing; black masks are littered across campus)::: and I can assure you picking a dirty used mask off the ground is far less ‚Äúhygienic‚Äù than wearing no mask. The mask policies do not reflect the current realities of November::: 2021. They did not in September of 2021 and certainly do not today.,Congrats Mike.

Divide and marginalize...,It is Columbus's Day and the people in his country of origin have been celebrating it for decades for this recognition. His statue in many places have honored his achievements. His explorations are written in many books and read throughout the world.,These two need diversity training to be more inclusive.

No::: this isn't ""anti-Catholic propaganda"". Us latino folks are the largest Catholic population in the world and we're all well aware that Columbus was an unsavory character who did more than a little genocide. Does that erase his accomplishments as an explorer? No. But lionizing a mass murderer to ""own the libs"" isn't just poor history::: it's the equivalent of holding up Attila the Hun or Genghis Khan as a figurehead to aspire for. Also::: interesting to see folks who normally have an anti-immigrant stance bending over backwards to defend Columbus Day as a ""holiday to celebrate immigrant contributions"". If you want to celebrate immigrants::: maybe reevaluate how you treat them outside of one day a year?",Thank you President Sands for your woke message.,Today is Columbus Day...,Contrary to the popular myth::: Christopher Columbus treated native Americans with great respect and friendship::: never intended their enslavement::: and even hanged members of his own crew who harmed them.,This is nothing but virtue signaling,Honestly::: if VT feels Soooooo bad about ‚Äúconfiscating‚Äù indigenous people‚Äôs land::: stop talking and give it back. Either give the land and all the buildings to the original historical Native Americans or STOP talking about how bad you feel about it. Better yet::: demo the entire campus and give it back as it was. Happy Columbus Day!!,All countries were formed by somebody conquering someone.

It was nearly a century later when Columbus Day became a federal holiday::: due in large part to lobbying efforts of the Knights of Columbus::: a Catholic service organization. While Christopher Columbus was a central symbol for the organization and the day::: the celebration was never meant to be about Columbus::: but rather recognize the work::: sacrifice::: and contributions of immigrants. The popular emphasis on Columbus is the result of ignorance::: xenophobia::: and anti-Catholic sentiment: ""if we focus on the man:::"" the Anglo-Protestan t majority reasoned::: ""we can appease the minority factions without acknowledging the meaning of the day.""

VTX.VT.EDU Virginia Cooperative Extension agents to be trusted messengers for COVID-19 vaccine information  Virginia Cooperative Extension September 23::: 2021 at 6:33 AM ¬∑  Researchers at Virginia Tech and Virginia State University are working to deliver facts about the #COVID19 vaccine in southern central and southwest Virginia through messengers community members know and trust: #VirginiaCooperativeExtension agents  This project is funded by grants from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the CDC.  Learn more ‚¨áÔ∏è bit.ly/VCECDC21,2021-09-23 13:32:10,I‚Äôm from a rural area in southwest VA that is currently being devastated by covid. I hope this helps some people move away from gossip and listen to science-proven facts ü§ûüèª,How about allowing for therapeutics? Medications that when given early are successful in treating COVID patients. With breakthrough infections the vaccine cannot do it all. We can walk and chew gum at same time. Why doesn‚Äôt the CDC recognize antibodies/ natural immunity? We can get free COVID vaccines::: free COVID tests::: but have to pay for antibody testing. Why? Some say natural immunity isn‚Äôt long-lasting (even though study after study proves it is). Apparently::: neither is immunity with vaccines since a booster is needed after 6 months. Seems testing for antibodies would be the most effective means of ascertaining safety from virus.  I graduated from nursing school in 1985. AIDS was a major health issue. There was 0% survivability then. Zero. I went to work in a white uniform and blue sweater I laundered at home even though I was surrounded by blood::: bodily fluids and sharp things all shift. Gloves were not available for patient care. HIV was not yet separated from AIDS. It was not affecting only one demographic. I took care of babies and toddlers who were diagnosed with AIDS who had zero chance of survival. Good thing we didn‚Äôt wait for a vaccine (that::: btw::: Dr. Fauci was working on). Good medications/ therapeutics were developed::: thanks be to God. Now HIV/AIDS is no longer a death sentence. More than 35 yrs later::: still no AIDS vaccine::: but patients who are HIV/AIDS positive not only survive::: but thrive::: because of good therapeutics/ medications. The same can be done for COVID 19.,Thank you::: Virginia Cooperative Extension::: for sharing FACTS and SCIENCE. As evidenced by the comments::: you have your work cut out for you.,The people that live in rural Virginia aren‚Äôt stupid::: backward::: or uneducated. Most of them can smell üí© a mile away. And many are VA Tech grads. Did anyone Consult the Cooperative Extension agents before they decided to spend money on this?,Okay::: let‚Äôs talk from anti-vaxxers‚Äô standpoint.  You don‚Äôt want to wear a mask::: social distance and get vaccinated::: for it curbs your so-called ‚ÄòFREEDOM‚Äô.  If you say COVID is real and recognize this as a global virus that has killed and is killing millions of people::: what then is YOUR SOLUTION?  Do you think wearing a lipstick will make COVID go away? Being gregarious like a herd of cattle will usher in herd immunity and you don‚Äôt need to do anything?  If you say you have natural immunity from any disease::: so I assume you have NEVER taken any medication in your life::: right? No cold/headache/ fever pills::: no shots for flu::: no medical treatment whatsoever::: right? And you you don‚Äôt trust any medicine until you do a through research yourself::: right?  Do you think using your ‚ÄòFREEDOM‚Äô to do whatever you want and however you want (from example::: crying from the rooftops that you are not willing to be a guinea pig) will make COVID disappear?

President Sands shares that 96% of the Virginia Tech population is vaccinated and positive tests are down::: while larger events like football games are not increasing the spread of COVID. Our mitigation measures are working::: but we must remain vigilant. ‚¨áÔ∏è  VTX.VT.EDU President Tim Sands updates Blacksburg campus on COVID-19 status,2021-09-20 13:51:42,As of 9/16/21 98% students reported vaccinated. 88% employees reported vaccinated.,I feel much better about the environment for our students this year.,Wow so 40% of the positives were unvaccinated people which are required to be tested weekly. This means that the remaining 60% were among the vaccinated people who are not required to be tested weekly. To make it clear: all unvaccinated are tested weekly::: all vaccinated are tested if they want to and of course risk missing classes and possibly having to leave campus for 10 days. How many vaccinated students do you think are risking that if they have mild or no symptoms.,I'm glad they're giving the virus some time off and the kids get a break from wearing masks indoors on weekends and evenings.,Keep up the great work protecting the health of students and staff! ü•∞,While I‚Äôm glad there are low cases::: you‚Äôre comparing apples to oranges. Weekly required testing of 100% of one group can‚Äôt be compared to requested::: symptomatic testing of another group. That‚Äôs basic math::: and VT should do better. Furthermore::: many sick students are having to wait multiple days to be tested on campus.,From what I‚Äôm hearing most of the students aren‚Äôt going to get tested- there was a huge upswing of students sick according to my freshman- it could have been a regular cold but no one went into a clinic to check. So if students are dealing with symptoms themselves without testing Pres. Sands won‚Äôt know if the illness was a common cold/flu or CoVID,Thank you for requiring vaccinations!,This is really great news! These kids get to have somewhat of a college experience this year ‚ù§Ô∏è,Way to go::: VT!,What about fans?,Really? 96% vaccinated?

Since all students are required to be vaccinated there's no requirement for testing even if sick.,I'm not looking to debate this topic::: but just trying to understand the data provided. If I'm reading the data correctly::: of the 139 students who were diagnosed with Covid::: 40% (or 56 students) were unvaccinated. This means 60% (83 students) were vaccinated and were diagnosed with covid. Meaning more vaccinated students were diagnosed then unvaccinated. Tabitha Johnson Plecker::: am I reading this correctly?,"""while larger events like football games are not increasing the spread of COVID."" - President Sands SERIOUSLY?! You can catch covid one on one but not in crowds of 65:::000+? What kind of insanity is that?! Where did he get his degree? CDC U?",You may want to point out that testing is mandatory for the unvaccinated on a weekly basis while testing for vaccinated is voluntary testing. Even random testing of vaccinated would make a big difference in the numbers. Many vaccinated students are testing off campus. I don‚Äôt believe you truly want to know the numbers for Covid on campus or you would expand your testing to everyone at VT. You only want to know the positivity rate for unvaccinated. Blacksburg population doubles when VT is in session. Look at the jump in Covid numbers in Blacksburg since school started. Suspect many of the cases are students testing off campus.,Just a note::: enough time has not passed for him to know if the football games are resulting in cases or not. Give it another month and look at the days first.,It would be great if more employees were vaccinated . My daughter an her roommate are vaccinated and still got sick,Why isn't it 100% after the news release that you are turning away the unvaccinated?,Can‚Äôt do better than VT.  Smart leadership::: smart students! Vaccinate!!,What About Masks::: we Still need to use them.,Bravo::: that is good news!,Amazing that you can have 100:::000 people in close contact and not worry @ any uptick in cases. How does one interpret Sands feeling that this doesn't pose a problem? Can it be extrapolated to a larger population?,Can‚Äôt we just hear the good news without the ‚Äúvigilant‚Äù statement? We know. We know.,Did he say anything about running a jet sweep to the boundary side?,Meanwhile at Schiffert::: the medical staff is drowning. Whether that's from the large amount of sick students or managements inability to hire. Considering the pay is so low::: you could probably be a manager at a grocery store and make more.,Before covid I have literally witnessed your sons and daughters going home with complete strangers they just met that night at tots. In the same night I have seen them drop Benny's pizza slices on the sidewalk and pick them up and eat them.  You can pass whatever mandate you want but it's not gonna stop young people from acting young,Don't have to be vaccinated or have a mask on at the football games::: I guess that is because the virus has that time off. Lol.,So thankful my sophomore is able to enjoy VT this year! Grateful for in person experiences!!,Awesome!!,It‚Äôs easy to get people to comply with your tyrannical mandates when you threaten their professional future with expulsion if they don‚Äôt go along with your whims. 40% of covid confirmed cases are unvaccinated. 60% are vaccinated. I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs more of a joke: Tim Sands decision making or Brad Cornelsen‚Äôs play calling.,Riley Jenkins you are among very smart people!,Awesome VA Tech!,Frani Smith,Great news,Excellent news!!üéâüéâ,How come the health center is so backed up?  A huge number of students are self testing local stores are sold out of test kits.

If we the public know how long can and will VT continue to ignore this ?,Abby Sykes you went to school where there are really smart people!,Wait are y‚Äôall testing vaccinated folks too? The state wide positives for fully vaccinated is about 36 percent? Are y‚Äôall seeing the same data?,Is the university still doing wastewater testing?

Recently::: the Corps of Cadets hosted their Corps Reunion::: the Hokies' Military Appreciation Game in Lane Stadium White Effect::: and a one-of-a-kind sesquicentennial show projected onto Lane Hall.  ‚û°Ô∏è https://vtcc.vt.edu,2021-09-16 19:31:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rather than house the four counselors at Cook Counseling Center or at one of the center‚Äôs satellite offices on campus::: university officials are embedding these new counselors within three separate colleges::: putting them closer to the students who traverse those hallways every day and to the faculty members who instruct them.

Update: After a thorough review of public health data including high transmission rates in the New River Valley and across Virginia::: and consistent with the advice provided by local and state public health officials::: Virginia Tech will extend its requirement of proper use of masks by all individuals::: regardless of vaccination status::: when indoors in designated public areas until further notice. üò∑  See original notice ‚¨áÔ∏è  VTX.VT.EDU University issues updated mask requirements for indoor spaces,2021-09-15 14:57:01,It‚Äôs amazing how polarized we are on this issue and every COVID decision. No one is going to convince the other camp::: so please stop trying. And please quit saying to follow the science‚Ä¶it is truly all over the map. For every scientist spouting one thing::: there is another scientist saying the opposite. The CDC continues to give conflicting information::: and honestly NONE of us has all the answers. So please stop pointing fingers and blaming others::: because usually those fingers come right back at you. Everyone has to make decisions and choices for themselves according to each situation. Respect each other. Just don‚Äôt forget to live life and do what you have to do to feel comfortable doing it. You can only control yourself!!,Funny::: all these indoor masks didn‚Äôt keep the campus crud from completely annihilating the student body. Four+ hour long waits at urgent cares::: nothing on the shelves at the drugstores::: etc‚Ä¶. Almost makes one realize the masks don‚Äôt do what they are thought to do. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Maybe VT should start listening to other scientists‚Ä¶,Interested to see the scientific studies that show that masks do anything to prevent the spread.,Give vaccinations at the games.......... ..,We have been to both games and::: although our family is vaccinated::: we wore our masks the whole time. I was amazed at how many people did not wear masks. The worst was children under 12 not wearing them. Why take a chance? I would rather try to stay safe.,Curious why they do not have to wear them at football games!!! Guess Covid doesn‚Äôt spread when VT is making money at the games.,Just here for the comments. Sadly::: they never disappoint. It‚Äôs amazing how many armchair scientist and experts are available to comment on this. Is it really that hard to be a decent human being a do something so easy to help protect yourself and others? I don‚Äôt care what ‚Äúside‚Äù your on. This is one simple thing that is asked of all of us. Now let the bashing of my comment begin‚Ä¶..,What about at Lane Stadium??? That‚Äôs an awful lot of people all crammed into one space!!!! It‚Äôs infuriating to me to see this at all the colleges and NFL!!!,I will tell you that my DS is fully vaccinated::: had Covid last February before he was vaccinated::: masked at VT indoors when he could and came home after one week at VT as he got Covid again as a breakthrough Covid. If mild Covid means you are sick::: fatigued::: headache::: sore throat::: have a fever and a cough::: then he was mild. And 10 days later he now has pneumonia::: can‚Äôt go to class again until next Monday and wants to stay at school even though is miserable and super sick. If by wearing a mask it‚Äôs possible to not have this happen to another student::: I‚Äôm all for it. This is not fun for anyone::: especially when YOUR DS or DD is the one that‚Äôs getting sick.,Hope you will enforce mask policy at Games too. That‚Äôs too many people sitting so close without masks !!,I read nothing we did not already know::: except they‚Äôve extended the date. I think parents whine more than the students. I‚Äôm thrilled my kid has in person classes::: is able to chill with friends and is having a blast at games. Looking forward to seeing him soon! üò∑,Cuz we have to protect the vaccinated right?,Due to a low rate of fear::: VT is mandating mask in order to bring fear levels up high enough to complete indoctrination of the strong students.,Are we looking at the same data? Because according to YOUR Covid dashboard::: out of the 8:::930 tests given this semester so far::: only 143 have tested positive. Now::: my calculator tells me that is a 0.016% positive rate. What does your calculator tell you? And correct me if I‚Äôm wrong::: but 0% of those positive tests have sent someone to the hospital on their death bed. It‚Äôs time you start making decisions based on actual data::: instead of fear.,Except for games thought right?,Like that cloth mask really does anything. It‚Äôs a politically correct look to appease. Wouldn‚Äôt work even if worn properly which they are not.,So 8:::930 tests have been done since the beginning of the school year. Only 127 positive results for students and 16 faculty/staff. Almost everyone is vaccinated. Football games are at full capacity with no masks required. Doesn‚Äôt sound like you‚Äôre following science to me.,Virginia Tech is pushing straight liberal propaganda to keep funding.  Clowns.,Soo you signed a contract with covid not to attack anyone at the stadium::: in the dormitories::: libraries::: study lounges::: food courts etc....such a smart virus!!,Good call. Hope NC can be receptive to similar. I don‚Äôt love wearing my mask but if it‚Äôs a means to quicker end of Covid I‚Äôm all in.,Good god when did logic and science get thrown to the wind for political optics?,Ridiculous. If you required everyone to be vaccinated before attending classes::: why make them mask up? Apparently you don‚Äôt believe the vaccine works.,Good::: keep students and faculty safe!,Why are 5% of students not vaccinated?,Glad to hear it!,Just a quick heads-up: There are other people in this area and that come to campus besides students.,Remember guys you can only transfer covid in classrooms but not at football games üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,Positive tests have never risen above 2.1% of tested students- just the ones that were tested within about three days. These is zero science behind this decision,"ü§£ü§£ indoor. Yet lane stadium is still at ""your discretion"" This is a joke. Right?",They don‚Äôt work. Exactly what science are you following?,I guess you don‚Äôt read the real research on masks. What a shame,Should‚Äôve saved your money like I told ya kids earlier this summer. VT had no intention of giving you freedom there. You paid them and they played you. Maybe next year lol,‚ÄúIf you do your part and get vaccinated::: we can all get ‚Äòback to normal‚Äô‚Äù FACT: science is fluid. The LIE that was told is the worst part.,When up against Covid-19::: there‚Äôs no safety in numbers. Let‚Äôs social distance to ensure our days are not numbered.  Get Vaccinated | Wear a Face Mask | Embrace Social Distancing | COVID ‚Äì Public Enemy Number One üôè üôè üôè üôè üôè üôè üôè üôè üôè üôè üôè üôè üôè üôè üôèüôè,There is no Science masks they don‚Äôt work period! Show me the science you can‚Äôt there is none. The Jab is no good ether just makes it worse.,Thank you,So sad,üôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑ,All that::: and cloth masks (like the ones in the picture) don't work. Go figure.,$c1‚Ç¨Nc‚Ç¨!,Alyssa Jorgensen at least I didn‚Äôt waste $30 on custom masks lol,Based on what I witnessed last week::: VT has a bigger issue with rampant underage drinking and drug use but no one seems to care about that.,Didn't expect anything different. VT likes the power,ü§°,ü§°ü§°ü§°,Those who oppose all the scientific methods::: vaccine & masks::: to protect students and staffs against CoViD19 needs to face penalties the same way for someone who is prosecuted for DUI. If you choose to drink & drive or unvaccinated & unmasked::: I believe you are endangering others and yourself. Punto!,Might want to require all students to learn Chinese also. Just sayin‚Ä¶..,This is news? That is literally what you're already doing,Soon very soon. üëÄ,Mask Mandates are Unlawful,Patrick Brookover,Be Conscious...,So 2.1 % positive rate of tested students... any hospitalization s? Deaths? More data please.,Thank youüëçüëå,There is no way these masks protect anyone from the aerosolized virus. I would like to see bio and chem students doing some experiments on the effectiveness of these cloth masks.,Because of the vaccine. Duh,Masks don‚Äôt work::: they only mitigate what they can. Reducing the amount of oxygen to the brain::: and increasing a higher rate CO2 caught within your mask.  Vaccines don‚Äôt work like they were supposed to. People are still getting covid.  Ivermectin is being shot down by all mainstream outlets::: yet it won Nobel Prize in 2015 for its miraculous work against viral infections and diseases. One of the cures was against malaria!,So the vaccines don‚Äôt work? Ok cool,It's not about your health it's about control::: do not comply,ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,These masks don‚Äôt stop anything You‚Äôre all brainwashed ü§åüèºüòµ‚Äçüí´,Absolutely ridiculous.,https:// www.wired.com/ story/ the-teeny-tiny-s cientific-screw up-that-helped- covid-kill/ One of Virginia Tech‚Äôs own researchers proved masks don‚Äôt work and that Fauci was wrong,Mask don‚Äôt work::: COVID has a 99.7 percent survival rate ::: y‚Äôall are crazy,Yariane Soto Mel√©ndez Yairis Soto Mel√©ndez,At least use a picture of a hokie mask üò∑,Requiring masks after the shot is anti-vax nonsense,Sheep,AJ Salisbury,Let‚Äôs go Hokies!,So::: what you are saying is that the vaccines don't work. Then why are you pushing our children to get the vaccine?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mental Health Initiatives Coordinator for Hokie Wellness::: Swathi Prabhu::: talks about the Mindful Campus Practices::: a series of short::: five-minute guided mindfulness practice recordings that combine imagery::: sound::: and other senses such as smell and feel.

But how are we protecting the students if there are unvaccinated or someone with COVID tested negative? Just a concern and worry as a parent.,It‚Äôs going to be a false positive this game because it won‚Äôt be a sell out night game.,They need to have more than once scanner at the gates. It took 45 minutes to get in last week. Ridiculous.,Mary Cote,Something to consider. UNCC ran into similar concession issues last Friday.,Less than packed game against MT yesterday and the lines for concessions were still incredibly long.

"VP for Virginia Tech Student Affairs Frank Shushok asks Hokies to remember who they are while cheering for their team at Saturday's football game. üèàü¶É  ""Let's hold ourselves to the highest standards of respect and care as we cheer on the Hokies."" ‚¨áÔ∏è https://fal.cn/3i5I3  VTX.VT.EDU From Frank Shushok::: Vice President for Student Affairs: Help set a high standard for game-day behavior",2021-09-09 16:00:02,The last time we went to a game we felt there was a tremendous push for the ‚ÄúDrive for 25‚Äù campaign and zero push for ‚ÄúHokie Respect‚Äù. Perhaps it‚Äôs time to refocus‚Ä¶,‚ÄúPlease speak up when others aren‚Äôt living up to Hokies Respect.‚Äù Hitler would be proud of you Frank...,This type of behavior inside Lane is what happens when alcohol is allowed at the games‚Ä¶ While the sale of alcohol increases revenue::: it lowers the standards of those unable to drink in moderation‚Ä¶ And while there has always been a presence of alcohol during the games::: it wasn‚Äôt as readily available::: or consumed so openly‚Ä¶,Whenever an organization decides to sell alcohol at an event::: they knowing what they are getting into ... just ask the NFL and PGA Tour.,We attended the Friday night game and the section we sat in was completely civil. Been going to VT games since I was 12 years old::: never have I seen a fight in the stands. Even heard a few VT fans say ‚Äúhey::: good game‚Äù to several Tarheel fans as they were leaving and not in a sarcastic tone. Our daughter is a sophomore at UNC::: we will be attending several of their games this season too. Basically::: if you have zero self control::: stay home and watch the game on television.,I grew up in WV and opted for VT because I didn‚Äôt want to be associated with the ‚Äúcouch burning‚Äù sort of behavior. Hokies Respect.,The behavior by our students and fans was truly an embarrassment to the university. Instead of celebrating our big win on Friday night::: we were portrayed on the national media as a bunch of drunken out of control fans and students. We need to keep the reputation of being a very loud and intimating place to play::: due to making Lane roar from cheers and vibrate from jumping. However::: shouting obscenities and throwing objects at opposing fans shows little class and isn‚Äôt who we are as a university. I appreciate and applaud our VP of Student Affairs writing his letter to address these behavior issues.,The chant is called Freedom of speech!,If we could keep it about football and Hokie spirit and save the political commentary for rallies or other appropriate forum::: that would be greeeeaaaat. Go Hokies!,If they did that to Trump those students would be called heros... not given instructions to hold to a higher standard...,So they can‚Äôt disparage Biden? I was proud of them Frank! #FirstAmendment,Yes üôåüèº class::: respect and hokie spirit!,meanwhile the behavior by many college students this past year has been ignored and applauded but yet when that behavior then starts directly affecting the reputation of the school it is all of a sudden a problem. . . .,I just wonder . . . if the same happened with Trump as prez would Shushok say the same thing? Highly doubtful.,WAS NOT VERY GOOD HIT A N.C. FAN WITH A BEER CAN HE WENT UP IN THE STANDS TO GET THE PERSON THAT HIT HIM WAS BEATEN POOR SPORTSMANSHIP ALTHOUGH I LOVE THE HOKIES.,Oh because it‚Äôs embarrassing when certain other chants are said? Maybe we should ask them WHY they are chanting? Because he‚Äôs a dictator perhaps?!?!?,What has happened to our students? What is wrong with people?,I was most offended by the incorrect stick it in chant,They‚Äôre pretty much guaranteeing that chant now‚Ä¶,Frank Shushok is the fun police! He needs replacing!,"Make sure every opposing fan leaves Blacksburg loving everything about their visit... except the results on the field.  We're not Morgantown. But don't draw the line at ""we're not as bad as Morgantown"". Draw the line at ""we're as far from Morgantown as we can be.""  Cheer::: scream::: make noise like mad during the game. And after the game::: find a visiting fan and thank them for coming to OUR town::: spending their hard earned money in OUR town::: and wish them the best for the rest of the season.  When Nebraska fans visited us in 2009::: and we broke their hearts at the end of that game::: the Nebraska fans next to me and my friends congratulated us on a great game and shook our hands. With tears in their eyes::: it hurt so bad for them. I took no joy in their pain (we've all been on that side of a loss)::: and Nebraska fans will always have a place at any tailgate I'm at.  Be that kind of fan. Be an AWESOME host AND an awesomely intimidating crowd for opposing teams. We can be both.",Stop kicking out students!,The lack of consideration is growing expediently in our country. Mix that with alcohol sales and big crowds and it‚Äôs a recipe for disaster.,This is a lesson for all hokies. We need to hold ourselves accountable on and off the football field. Even online.,Since when is a football game about Joe Biden? I thought it was about playing a football game with another team. Grow up people. I am a Hokie - how sad............ ...,Timothy Rowland,That was respecting our Country. Go Hokies,Kinda annoyed I passed up the first game. Looked and sounded awesome. My son loved his first game. A little drinking I guessüòâ. Kids will be kidsüëç I'm sure the Military game will be a great game üá∫üá≤. Can't wait...üí™üá∫üá≤üí™,Lol I‚Äôm sorry but telling any group of people ‚Äúnot‚Äù to do something is pretty much a guarantee they will do it. It‚Äôs so odd to me people only get scolded for certain behaviors. Maybe the fact that it happened at each and every college game last weekend might be a small wake up call.,"How about we being back the stick it in chant? Ever since Weaver I haven't seen much 'spirit' at games. Yelling at refs and at the other team::: stomping the bleachers::: the key jangle on third down::: and the hokey pokey are what make football watching fun. Take that away and you might as well watch a boring tennis match on TV at home for free. Not saying we need Eagles stadium levels of rowdiness but the games 10+ yrs ago were more fun to attend then they are now w ""Hokies Respect"". Team played better then too.",I am appalled at the ‚Äúinstructions‚Äù that went out to the students this week. They were smart enough to get into Tech::: but need to be talked to like elementary students? Their seating area will be designated by a tarp so they know where to sit? Can they not read their tickets? These are young adults. They should be able to follow the rules without hand holding. There was plenty of crazy at the games I attended in the 70‚Äôs~ and too much alcohol. But the guys looked out for each other and took care of the ones who had gone too far. This is beyond what I saw then or have seen in recent years. Do better::: Hokies.,Act like you‚Äôve been there and beating as rank opponent is nothing new.,Trying to control every aspect of peoples lives. How to act::: how to think::: how to live.

This ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù is not out there to help us but to cause us to become more sick hence the reason virologists have warned that a vaccine would cause many variants to show up. It‚Äôs done it with every corona virus that has been. Why did they think this was going to be any different. The contents of the virus itself will cause your body to attack itself and many diseases are going to result from it. But keep up the Vit c::: D Selenium and zinc to fight the virus and to fight the side affects of the virus. I‚Äôve had too many people I know die from it or have nerve damage or not be able to function mentally losing their cognitive abilities. This vaccine has not been around long enough. The FDA knew of these side effects and still allowed it out. Why not use Ivermectin to stop the virus and prevent it from speading rather than forcing people to take something harmful and possibly fatal to them? Forcing those who have had Covid to take it too. There are immunities there!! I just don‚Äôt get it!!,You are pushing unapproved::: experimental gene therapy on people against their will. I thought we humans had learned our lessons regarding human experimentation ? The masks do absolutely nothing::: they state such on the sides of the boxes.

If you had required 100% of the students and staff to be vaccinated::: then no masks would be required right and our children could have a normal college experience.,Good job VT WAY TO GO,If you are going to mandate masks::: you better mandate N95 masks or something equivalent. Otherwise::: you are actually not applying ANY scientific basis at all and this is just an excercise in tyranny. I hope somebody with brains reads this and understands and appreciates what I am saying. Cloth and nylon masks that I see most people wearing do absolutely NOTHING. You might as well put women's stockings over your face.  And for those who think that these types of masks actually prevent the micron-sized virons from entering your airway because the virons are surrounded by spittle::: think again. If anything::: they would breakup the larger particles into smaller ones thereby causing you to potentially receive a higher viral load than if you weren't wearing any sufficiently protective mask.,#protectyourfami ly,üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª,Great job::: Hokies!!!,Way to lead the way VT!!!!,Vaccine isn't working don't yall understand.

Natural immunity should have always been the gold standard with early treatment and a healthy lifestyle as the goal - this provides both antibodies as well as T cell long term memory. Vaccines don‚Äôt. Any deaths from this virus are simply due to both the government officials::: agencies::: and media lies - not just during this pandemic - but stemming from the food and environmental practices allowed to detrimentally harm us as a population beginning in the 70s. That is why society as a whole is not healthy enough to withstand this virus without casualty. Wake up people. You‚Äôre fighting the wrong enemy.,News Flash: the vaccine does not make you immune. Even the CDC you so clearly trust says so. Stop the lies.,Woke! Woke! Woke!,The CDC director said just weeks ago the vaccine no longer works to slow the spread. It‚Äôs like everyone is willfully ignorant or so political about this they can‚Äôt even see when new data comes out. They also say the vaccine is only 42% effective now based on a recent Israeli study. At my place employment we lost 4 fully vaccinated employees just this week. The vaccine is a joke and y‚Äôall are the perfect puppets. Y‚Äôall obey out of fear and misinformation,Josh Zylka,üëéüèº,I am waiting for someone to refuse the jab::: get fired and sue.

You may be entitled to a settlement!,Thank you!,"What in the world is a ""Surveillance Testing Program?"" Sounds kind of 1984ish.",When I attended VT::: it was much more open and less totalitarian. You need more professors like this award-winning law prof at New Mexico State University who lays out the COVID vaccine stats for his students and why he want be getting the jab.  Did you know they pulled the fully FDA-approved swine flu vaccine after only 32 deaths? Yet there have been over 12000 deaths from emergency-only COVID vaccines and they're not pulling them::: they're mandating them. https:// rumble.com/ vlf3ua-law-profe ssor-refuses-to -mask-up-or-get -the-jab.html,According to the CDC::: Pfizer and Moderna clinical trial submissions::: and reported by the Washington Post::: the vaccinated and unvaccinated carry the same risks.

She completely ignores this fact obvious to anyone with a basic understanding of adaptation. We are also not so stupid that we need 5 year old donut analogies.

'fascinating... .',True but not the whole truth. This is another push for vaccines and masks which isn‚Äôt as necessary anymore (unless you have a compromised immune system - then you should likely get the vaccine - talk to your doctor).  Variants are still transmitted by those with the vaccine right? Therefore the vaccinated are also providing opportunities for the virus to mutate upon transmission.  Also::: she said there is now 1000 times more presence in the nasal passage::: meaning there is increased transmission through masks that aren‚Äôt rated for trapping virus particles. That means all those cloth masks::: blue surgery masks and any other cheap masks (which actually state they don‚Äôt stop virus transmission) are pretty much useless against it. Masks are a PLACEBO at this point. Something to make people feel like they are playing their part. They (masks) are already polluting the environment by the 10‚Äôs of millions now (look it up) so unless you are buying M95 or similar ones::: it isn‚Äôt worth it.  The vulnerable should get vaccinated::: the young and the healthy do not. Then make life choices that best suits your families but don‚Äôt try to force others to do the same.

Whatever it takes to keep everyone safe. Go Hokies!,Do what it takes to stop the spread of this deadly delta variant. Protect immunocompromis ed kids and college community who have no other options to protect themselves. Good lord::: wearing a mask and getting a shot is not much of a sacrifice.,So every student on campus will have a least one shot covid since yall are denrolling students who haven't gotten their shots yet we all need to wear mask? The question is if you guys are pushing for vaccine saying that it's backed by science and it works then way do we need to wear masks again. The CDC has been flip flopping their position almost every other week. You're a well respected university do some thinking on your own for once.,If classes are going virtual::: why mandate the vaccine then? Who pushed who in this mandate which ONLY applied to students and NOT faculty and staff. Sorry::: this makes no sense to me.,Also::: I don‚Äôt think this is a coincidence that this dropped THE FINAL DAY the vaccine card upload is required AND tuition payment is due.

Why did you force students to upload vaccine status if they have to wear masks? I‚Äôve defended my alma mater on a lot of things the past few years but this is ridiculous and there‚Äôs no reason for it.

A lot of comments that aren't very VT. Whenever people dont agree the name calling starts. People we are allowed to disagree with one another. If you want the shot do it.

I find that hard to believe,Cant wait to see everyone masked up at center and lane ü§†üëçüèº,ME: CDC::: should I get a poke if I already had Covid?  CDC: ‚ÄúYes::: you should be poked regardless of whether you already had COVID-19. That‚Äôs because experts do not yet know how long you are protected from getting sick again after recovering from COVID-19.‚Äù  ME: Oh::: okay::: we don‚Äôt know how long natural immunity lasts. Got it. So::: how long does poke-induced immunity last?  CDC: ‚ÄúThere is still a lot we are learning about COVID-19 pokes and CDC is constantly reviewing evidence and updating guidance. We don‚Äôt know how long protection lasts for those who are poked.‚Äù  ME: Okay ‚Ä¶ but wait a second. I thought you said the reason I need the poke was because we don‚Äôt know how long my natural immunity lasts::: but it seems like you‚Äôre saying we ALSO don‚Äôt know how long poke immunity lasts either. So::: how exactly is the poke immunity better than my natural immunity?  CDC: ‚Ä¶  ME: Uh ‚Ä¶ alright. But::: haven‚Äôt there been a bunch of studies suggesting that natural immunity could last for years or decades?  CDC: Yes.  NEWYORKTIMES: ‚ÄúYears::: maybe even decades::: according to a new study.‚Äù  ME: Ah. So natural immunity might last longer than poke immunity?  CDC: Possibly. You never know.  ME: Okay. If I get the poke::: does that mean I won‚Äôt get sick?  BRITAIN: Nope. We are just now entering a seasonal spike and about half of our infections and hospital admissions are poked people.  ME: CDC::: is this true? Are there a lot of people in the U.S. catching Covid after getting the poke?  CDC: We stopped tracking breakthrough cases. We accept voluntary reports of breakthroughs but aren‚Äôt out there looking for them.  ME: Does that mean that if someone comes in the hospital with Covid::: you don‚Äôt track them because they‚Äôve been poked? You only track the UN-poked Covid cases?  CDC: That‚Äôs right.  ME: Oh::: okay. Hmm. Well::: if I can still get sick after I get the poke::: how is it helping me?  CDC: We never said you wouldn‚Äôt get sick. We said it would reduce your chances of serious illness or death.  ME: Oh::: sorry. Alright::: exactly how much does it reduce my chance of serious illness or death.  CDC: We don‚Äôt know ‚Äúexactly.‚Äù  ME: Oh. Then what‚Äôs your best estimate for how much risk reduction there is?  CDC: We don‚Äôt know::: okay? Next question.  ME: Um::: if I‚Äôm healthy and don‚Äôt want the poke::: is there any reason I should get it?  CDC: Yes::: for the collective.  ME: How does the collective benefit from me getting poked?  CDC: Because you could spread the virus to someone else who might get sick and die.  ME: Can a poked person spread the virus to someone else?  CDC: Yes.  ME: So if I get poked::: I could still spread the virus to someone else?  CDC: Yes.  ME: But I thought you just said::: the REASON I should get poked was to prevent me spreading the virus? How does that make sense if I can still catch Covid and spread it after getting the poke?  CDC: Never mind that. The other thing is::: if you stay unpoked::: there‚Äôs a chance the virus could possibly mutate into a strain that escapes the pokes protection::: putting all poked people at risk.  ME: So the poke stops the virus from mutating?  CDC: No.  ME: So it can still mutate in poked people?  CDC: Yes.  ME: This seems confusing. If the poke doesn‚Äôt stop mutations::: and it doesn‚Äôt stop infections::: then how does me getting poked help prevent a more deadly strain from evolving to escape the poke?  CDC: You aren‚Äôt listening::: okay? The bottom line is: as long as you are unpoked::: you pose a threat to poked people.  ME: But what KIND of threat??  CDC: The threat that they could get a serious case of Covid and possibly die.  ME: My brain hurts. Didn‚Äôt you JUST say that the poke doesn‚Äôt keep people from catching Covid::: but prevents a serious case or dying? Now it seems like you‚Äôre saying poked people can still easily die from Covid even after they got the poke just by running into an unpoked person! Which is it??  CDC: That‚Äôs it::: we‚Äôre hanging up now.  ME: Wait! I just want to make sure I understand all this. So::: even if I ALREADY had Covid::: I should STILL get poked::: because we don‚Äôt know how long natural immunity lasts::: and we also don‚Äôt know how long poke immunity lasts. And I should get the poke to keep a poked person from catching Covid from me::: but even if I get the poke::: I can give it to the poked person anyways. And::: the other poked person can still easily catch a serious case of Covid from me and die. Do I have all that right?  ‚Ä¶  ME: Um::: hello? Is anyone there?

Does that qualify as a ‚Äúmask‚Äù/‚Äúface covering‚Äù?,What is really disappointing is to see so many blindly agreeing with this form of control!,So was the CDC wrong the first time they told people with the shot to take the masks off? Or are they just making things up as they go?  Either way::: they do not deserve anyone's trust or respect.,So is football still going to happen? That‚Äôs outside::: so it sounds like you can tailgate all day::: go to the game::: then hit the bars all in large crowds without a mask::: but to go to class monday you need one. Does that make even a little bit of sense,Glad to see they‚Äôre taking steps to stop the spread and keep students/ staff healthy‚Ä¶especially with the variants.,Ridiculous! You tested them every week last year::: required them to be vaccinated::: took away a year of their ‚Äúnormal‚Äù college experience and now you are doing it again! Keep it up and you may find it difficult to get kids to continue coming to college when their experience it greatly diminished!,So disappointed in VT. It‚Äôs all politics and Sands is ruining this once great university.,This means that the vaccine is not as good as they said? This is a campus where everyone was required to have the vaccine.,Not much incentive to get the vaccine::: eh? This policies implies that it doesn't work,Power and control over freedom and personal liberty. It‚Äôs not about safety and is surely not about education.,My god the amount of people that don‚Äôt know how science works is staggering. On a prestigious university page no less (though I‚Äôm assuming most of the comments like that aren‚Äôt people that attend). Yikes üò¨,Okay::: this is absolutely insane. 88% of students are fully vaccinated with a day left to upload our cards. That‚Äôs a larger percentage than you will find in most communities around the entire world. Seriously::: how large is the risk here?  You already treat students that refuse to get the vaccine as second-class citizens who don‚Äôt deserve rights. The vaccinate isn‚Äôt understood any better than COVID itself - you can‚Äôt treat it like the flu shot. Stop blaming and judging people for being hesitant.  How many more guilt-trip emails will we receive from Frank Shushok telling us how horrible all us students are for wanting to INTERACT with other people? How long until the school once again threatens to send police to arrest students in large gatherings way off campus?  We are adults. We have to be able to make our own choices. It is a total lie to say that we will still receive the full educational experience with our masks on. Professors cannot built strong rapport with their students::: words in lectures can be hard to make out::: facial expressions can‚Äôt be understood etc. And as winter approaches I think we all know that the school won‚Äôt be dropping this mandate any time soon.  At the very least::: have the decency to charge your students fair tuition based on the circumstances. You can‚Äôt make these changes FOUR days before tuition is due and not expect outrage. You are leaving us all in a bottomless pit of debt while you spend our money to construct all of your precious new buildings. This administration is ridiculous‚Ä¶,Why don't they mandate a personal bubble::: goggles::: a fan on your head::: and some condoms?! HAHAHAHAHA!,üòÇ require everyone to get the vaccine::: then tell them the vaccine doesn‚Äôt work and still require masks. What a joke.

üì£ Hey Hokies! Check out this updated information on our testing program and public health guidelines for non-vaccinated students and employees on campus this fall ‚¨áÔ∏è  VTX.VT.EDU COVID-19 testing program outlined for fall semester,2021-08-03 12:50:02,Just to verify Virginia Tech::: spit tests will still be available? You originally stated they were but apparently there is some confusion now with some saying no spit tests will be available.,Taking the new CDC guidelines into account::: if you‚Äôre going to require testing and masks even the vaccinated should be included. Vaccination does not equal immune or incapable of spreading.,I‚Äôm not sure when the vaccine makers ever stated that it would keep anyone from getting c-19. It was only ever intended to mute the severity. We need them to work harder on medication development for the symptoms now. I think we can blame the CDC::: WH and media for telling us we can ‚Äúget back to normal‚Äù ‚Äúvaccines stop the virus‚Äù if we get the vax. It simply hasn‚Äôt born out to be factual. It limits the severity and that is the end of the story. It is more likely than not that this virus will do like others before it and become easier to catch and milder over the years. I think we can all see it isn‚Äôt going to stop spreading for the time being. Let‚Äôs hope it weakens sooner rather than later.,So a vaccinated person with asymptomatic infection does not have to be subjected to weekly testing (which at times results in false positives‚Ä¶). Got it. üôÑ,Why not boost immune system and we have cheap meds if you do get it. My son had it in March and just a bad cold. Flus::: strep and mono are much worse but I guess Covid has just about eliminated that now which is good.,You going to pay medical expenses if I have any side effects?,Are teachers reporting to work or is VT going remote again...since the teachers have the choice and they are choosing to stay home.,With rising numbers of vaccinated contracting and spreading Covid::: it seems everyone would need to wear masks and be tested::: for the safety of all.,I'd like to see Va Tech doing more to protect employees with children under 12 and at risk family members or dependents. Right now we have to jump through too many hoops and the ADA people are going to be swamped.,This should now apply to vaccinated people as well since it seems like there are more and more breakthrough cases of vaccinated people both getting it and transmitting it.,The link seems to be broken,Deaths from covid are pretty far down the list these days. If we‚Äôre going to mask up and freak out with no end in sight::: why aren‚Äôt we banning fast food? Cars? Don‚Äôt get me started on the thousands of covid infected illegals pouring into our country.,Sorry Virginia Tech I fear loosing freedom more than death,https:// covid19criticalc are.com/ covid-19-protoco ls/ math-plus-protoc ol/ FLCCC Alliance has a proven protocol for folks that test positive‚Ä¶lots of studies attached too,John E.

Already vaccinated? üíâ Make sure to register your vaccination with Virginia Tech before the deadline!

Employees can register in the COVID-19 Vaccination Status Self-reporting form. ‚û°Ô∏è https://ready.vt.edu/vaccinations.html,2021-07-19 18:48:31,FYI to parents who are upset about this overreach to force the V on their student:  VT offered the Religious Exemption form or the Medical Exemption form. Your student has it thru the link in their VT email about the Aug 6 requirement so plz talk to them. Just because VT doesn‚Äôt publicize the form on FB to share the option with as many people as they can doesn‚Äôt mean students didn‚Äôt receive it. Legally they have to. It‚Äôs not a VT option::: It‚Äôs VA state law to have a religious exemption for anyyyyy V.  Plus VT admitted in a spring email newsletter to families that they could not require the V because it only has Emergency Use Authorization. It‚Äôs only because the AG came out in April and gave the green light to turn a blind eye that they decided to mandate it anyway!  This is what the Virginia state code says: 12VAC5-110-80. Exemptions from immunization requirements. A. Religious and medical exemptions. No certificate of immunization shall be required of any student for admission to school if: 1. The student or his parent or guardian submits a notarized Certificate of Religious Exemption (Form CRE 1)::: to the admitting official of the school to which the student is seeking admission. Form CRE 1 is an affidavit stating that the administration of immunizing agents conflicts with the student's religious tenets or practices. The form is available on the Division of Immunization website at www dot doe dot virginia dot gov and then look under support.  But obviously it‚Äôs ideal to just use the VT form form provided for the exemption.,Lori Castle Poole,Go Hokies!

Please don't allow the admin to gas light you. The choice to be so willing to appease the schools illegitimate requirement is not as popular as you may think. This group is an echo chamber. Descent is being censored and removed. Just as I am sure this post will be. We all love our children and the choice is legally up to the individual....f or now.,There is a mandate for the professors to be vaccinated also::: correct??,Hokie pride is falling fast. As an alumni and parent I am very disappointed that President Sands cares so little about our students. Saying unvaccinated students should consider transferring is so uncaring and awful. Many have dedicated years and hours to their dream of being a Hokie and getting an education at our state supported University and are being encouraged to go elsewhere. Maybe every unvaccinated donor will also look at other options as well.,I applaud your vaccine requirement!

My son‚Äôs allergic to dairy but yeah::: he‚Äôll risk allergic reaction to the V for him to go to class üôÑ Give me a break.,Please read this letter from Dr. Sands.,Amazing school with amazing talented young brilliant students ::: keep our kids safe,Dr. Sands::: I'd like to ask why you decided to skip the very important panel discussion yesterday? I hope you got an opportunity to at least watch it. A few points: Dr. O'Dell is looking for a milestone of 75% maxes...is that also your feeling regarding opening the classrooms? Dr. Hagerford explained how wonderful the students did in the spring::: you even had graduation ceremonies...wh y the push? Dr. Shushock::: you and I spoke about a month and a half ago::: you personally said to me that you had 2 college aged children and were very much hoping there would be no mandate..How are you feeling now? Mr. Mulhare..we spoke recently::: you mentioned that VT is offering incentives for teachers to return to campus..How is that going? Dr. Sands..Dean Learman said that those students who chose to not get maxed should talk with students that have and if convinced::: someone will be waiting behind them with the dance. Do you really think that was the best wording? You just scared the heck out of more students. Also::: not one of the people on the panel could back up any of their statistics. It would have been nice to have references where students and parents could read the same information they were spouting. Now you must understand that every parent went and did their own research on what was said and it was mostly inaccurate. Dr. Sands::: Do you find it odd that you had less than 200 people watching::: maybe they are tired of your bullying. Mr. Mulhare stated mandating employees of VT is not an option at this time. You have also said it was illegal. Do you think that maybe explaining to those who may not be aware that a RE or ME is also an option for students should have been mentioned...or does that not fit your agenda? Lastly::: why won't you make a decision on opening the classrooms? Is that because you cannot get enough professors to come back?...In the meantime you have no problem taking the money for football tix and opening Lane. Ut Prosim..that I may serve::: who exactly are you serving now? You are not listening to the students who want to go back into the classrooms instead of watching You Tube videos::: you are not taking the time to address parents' concerns::: heck::: you are not even listening to the Fox Delta Alpha or Charlies Delta Charlie regarding adverse reactions. When adverse reactions were mentioned yesterday::: it was literally ignored. Isn't just one Hokie suffering enough for you to be concerned? We are a community after all. To all of you::: you have ruined the essence of why people fell in with VT and why students and parents made the choice of VT over other schools. It seems that the students are no longer your priority. It is very sad that you can't see that. I would hope that at least one person is kind enough to respond.,Of course have to keep checking the FAQ as u keep changing the rules,And this comment thread is why Virginia tech is one of the schools I have taken OFF my college list next year,‚ÄòNeed‚Äô strong words for misleading policies at a ‚Äòresearch‚Äô institute üò°,VT got national attention.,Sam Glass,If interested in a parents fb group that is against this mandate::: message me.,To all those still not getting vaccinated - latest CDC data shows 10:::260 deaths related to covid in June with 99.2% of those unvaccinated!! Yes 99.2% that is how effective the vaccines are!Hospitaliza tions increased vs May with 95% of those unvaccinated and 45% being under 50 - 3x the rate of last year. The delta variant is driving a surge of cases amongst the unvaccinated and is more dangerous to the younger population than previous strains.

Join public health experts discussing vaccinations and requirements for Fall 2021 to help Hokies #BeCommittedBeWell. Get a reminder and more information on the event page ‚¨áÔ∏è  WED::: JUL 14::: 2021 Public health experts to discuss vaccinations and requirements,2021-07-13 14:23:47,Hey Virginia Tech - you deleting comments again? Silencing the opposition because you know the opposition has legal ground to stand on and you don‚Äôt?,Instead of talking about the darn vaccine::: why don't we talk about the mental health of our college students? This is the real danger that our students are facing . . . not covid. These young adults have suffered greatly the past 15 months - loneliness::: isolation::: anxiety::: depression and suicidal ideation. Covid . . . they can recover from. Suicide . . . they cannot! Your mandate has done nothing but add unnecessary stress to an already stressful situation. Do you want to heal our Hokies? Then VT needs to commit right now to 100% in-person classes. You have already said you are committed to packing Lane Stadium in the fall::: so why not commit to packing the classrooms with Hokies in the fall as well?,Will this be an full discussion about the pros and cons regarding the vaccine? If it‚Äôs only going to discuss all the ‚Äúbenefits‚Äù and not discuss the side affect risks then there‚Äôs no point in joining as Facebook daily posts all the ‚Äúbenefits‚Äù of getting the vaccination and we don‚Äôt need another advertisement for the product::: we need facts::: good and bad so that our children can make an informed decision.,I would like to know if you will be discussing in-person classes and what you are using as a basis point as to whether you go in-person or stick the students back in their apts and dorms. The bursar confirmed today that a decision has not been made. We already know classes have been moved from in-person to remote on the schedules. We already know teachers are being granted permission to teach remotely. What kind of incentives are you offering them to come back to campus? I was told directly by the VT administration that incentives are being offered. Give incentives to a person to do their job?? Ut Prosim at it's best???? I hope these issues will be addressed in the town hall and If not I would appreciate a response.,Great idea! I wonder if there is a forum where vaccinated students could share their experience with their peers who may harbor concerns. I know here in San Francisco we have had luck reaching vaccine hesitant communities by making sure that outreach is done by the members of the community vs a top down approach. This has allowed us to hit 82% first dose and continue to have some of the lowest covid cases in the country.,I‚Äôd be more interested in hearing about the on campus and off campus ‚Äòexperience‚Äô and ‚Äòconsequences‚Äô for the kids who don‚Äôt get vaxed. For those who got the waiver forms notarized. Specifically for kids living off campus. Random Testing? Mask wearing and monitoring. Class attendance. Inside. Outside. Etc.,I am a little confused. It was stated that it is mandatory to get the vaccine and if a kid doesn‚Äôt they will be unregistered from classes. Yet they then said later in the video for those unvaxed::: they will need to do testing and wear masks. So they can still go to classes and are fully enrolled in school? No mention of the notarized/ waiver kids. Is that who they mean by those unvaxed kids? Also will those who submitted the notarized form be advised that they are exempt? And will they then fall into the mask and testing group? Sorry but they seemed to say a few different things.,"Love how the ""experts"" were veterinarians! Some experts. Avoided all questions::: didn't mention anything about exemptions.",I just have one question‚Ä¶..whic h vax is least likely to kill or seriously harm my child? Can someone answer that for me? TIA.,I hope VT officials read this: I find it extremely troubling that the administration continues to divide the VT community by not recognizing the legitimate concerns being raised by thousands of parents and students with this unproven vaccine. I think you are doing a disservice to your valued stakeholders by ignoring the perspectives of folks that have carefully decided against getting this vaccine - another town hall with one-sided ‚Äúexperts‚Äù claiming it is safe is not going to change any minds at this point. Rather::: you should be engaging in a true town hall discussion that includes constructive dialogue and allowing questions and concerns to be be raised from both sides::: especially with those that have made the personal decision to not obtain the vaccine in an effort to better understand and respect their concerns. Only then will we be able to begin moving forward::: towards a successful and safe Fall semester with both vax‚Äôd and non-vax‚Äôd students and staff on campus::: because that is going to be the reality. The longer you ignore it::: you continue to promote this ridiculous divisiveness and prevent this tremendous community from coming together once again in the true best interests of all students and the university.,How about make it about choice. My son had it in March and full of antibodies. More than any jab will give him with no side effects.,I hope one of the experts is Dr. Robert Malone::: the inventor of mRNA vaccines.,Hope it's a discussion not a closed town hall like last time.üôÑ,Will you be discussing in-person classes?

A group of students in the Virginia Tech College of Agriculture and Life Sciences used drone technology to collect land and soil samples to identify areas that need supplemental nutrients.  ‚ÄúMy favorite part of the project was when we saw our results.

This having to land to pick up data for something like the USDA soil survey::: would mean someone out there swapping batteries all day::: when they could easily drive around on a 4-wheeler like they do already and take samples by hand.  I do not think we should give up on the technology because it can get us in those hard to reach places but until batteries last longer and we have greater technology::: these are still only good for photographs due to their low weight bearing capacity.

But ""during this time of pandemic"" also needs to be clarified now: the Governor's state of emergency ended. The Commonwealth of Virginia is no longer in an emergency situation; therefore it follows we are no longer in ""this time of pandemic""; therefore it follows the OAG opinion is no longer applicable; therefore it follows Virginia Tech no longer has any legal basis for mandating vaccinations.

If you haven‚Äôt gotten the vaccine::: get it. üíâ https://www.vaccines.gov/search  If you‚Äôve gotten it::: verify it. ‚úÖ https://ready.vt.edu/vaccinations.html#instructions  If you have questions::: ask. üó£ https://ready.vt.edu/vaccinations/student-vaccine-faqs.html,2021-06-29 12:00:56,I fully support the vaccine mandate. The risk from vaccines is extremely small compared to the risk from covid and the latest delta variant is twice as infectious as the original covid virus. In order to protect everyone on campus this fall we need maximum vaccination rates and then hopefully we can avoid any nasty covid outbreaks and default back to virutal classes.,Attending VT is a privilege::: not a right. Either comply with the mandate or find another school. Choices have consequences.,As a Blacksburg community member with a child too young to be vaccinated::: and who watched the infection numbers shoot up last year when VT started classes in the Fall::: I am incredibly grateful for this decision on the part of both Virginia Tech and Radford University to help protect our entire community,Funny how we were raised NOT to be peer pressured into taking experimental drugs‚Ä¶ now we‚Äôre being peer pressured into taking experimental drugs.,If our students get the vaccine even thought they have recovered from Covid then they will not be able to donate plasma to the red cross.,No!,Maybe instead of calling it a vaccine it could be marketed as the ‚ÄúHokie-Pokey‚Äù.,SHAME ON YOU FOR RECOMMENDING AND GIVING THESE EVIL SHOTS!!!! YOU WILL ANSWER TO GOD ALMIGHTY!!!!!!! !!,It's one thing to require vaccines that have very long proven histories of not causing ill effects. It's totally another thing to require a vaccine that has zero long-term studies done. I don't understand how a publicly-funded university has the right to force students to get a vaccine they might rightfully not trust yet::: in order to get proper in-person instruction which they pay for. Those who are worried about unvaccinated students being near them should either get vaccinated themselves (which would then protect them) or wear an N95 when going in public (which are widely available and protect the wearer). It's not right to force the many to cater to the few::: when we're talking about a vaccine without any long term history and already a few trends of negative reactions popping up::: especially in younger people. Very disappointed in VT on this one.,double standard‚Ä¶. faculty and staff not required::: students are! More do as I say::: not as I do posturing. Makes me sick!!!!!!,Only 25% of students are vaccinated at this point so I guess not a whole lot of Hokies want the jab. Get a clue VT - you can't coerce the students in to getting this if they don't want it.,I have never been so disappointed at my Alma Mater for this insidious decision.,I noticed the faculty/staff vaccination numbers don't match what was presented in the town hall. I hope the university is going to mandate the professors teach in person and no longer give them the option to teach asynchronous (not teaching) or synchronous. It's time to get back in the classroom and teach in addition to research.,My child would have to go to a different school. And we are 3 generation Hokies!!!,This is disgusting,The ideals of Ut Prosim indicate that::: even if it is not your preferred plan of action::: since getting the COVID vaccine improves our herd immunity chances::: we should get the vaccine to help our community.  Either you understand that::: or I question your commitment to the ideals that VT stands by.,If the goal is immunity::: why is natural immunity being ignored. I still have antibodies::: verified by a recent blood test::: streaming through my body from my prior infection. In addition I have mucosal immunity::: something the vaccines do not provide. Why are we ignoring decades of immunity knowledge and requiring people who have natural immunity take a risk::: however small::: when it is unnecessary? Can someone please give a logical answer to ignoring natural immunity???!!,I missed this part of Town Hall so someone tell me why professors/ staff/admin are not required to get it as the students are. That seems wrong to me.,It‚Äôs not too much to ask for all Americans to do their part to help stop this deadly Covid pandemic by getting the vaccines.,I'm getting tired of this Left crap in our schools,I am so ANGRY right now I could spit nails!! This University forced my daughter to make a decision RIGHT NOW that she was not prepared and ready to make at this time.

This is an experimental shot that gives only temporary protection. I don‚Äôt think VT has ever required a vaccine for attendance that is a seasonal shot. If you have please indicate what it is::: as I would very much like to know.,VT::: with all of the information being released on the dangers of this vaccine to young people::: please reverse the vaccine mandate and allow individuals to decide what is right for them and their bodies! This is just not acceptable as we do not know the long term affects on our young people! It is alarming that VT and some parents think this is acceptable when its clearly and over reach of power! Come on VT::: cancel this vaccine mandate and respect one‚Äôs right to decide what goes into their body!!,Why make this decision AFTER the prospective students made their college choice. You clearly stated that you COULD NOT mandate a vaccine that was not approved by the FDA. Now you have reversed that decision - but the vaccine is still under Emergency Use.,It should be a ‚Äòchoice‚Äô. A personal decision.,Is the faculty required to get the vaccine? If not::: then the must be replaced by vaccinated professors right? Total hypocrisy on the University leadership. I wish I could afford an attorney::: but I am too busy paying for college.,The University's choice to force a non FDA approved drug::: with no long term effects even known::: approved for emergency use only::: will most certainly have an enormous long term negative impact on the University. Assuredly resulting in massive student withdrawal (including lost funding from Alumni)::: as well as a large number of lawsuits to be filed. I will hope that after further review wisdom prevails::: and this ridiculous and illegal requirement gets retracted quickly.,You‚Äôre holding these students hostage! No normalcy unless they get an experimental vaccine to protect the staff-who isn‚Äôt required to get it- Yet I have no doubt you‚Äôll pack Lane with unvaccinated fans and staff this fall.,VT::: allow freedom of medical choice in that of your students and staff re: your push to mandate a non-FDA-approve d vaccine in that of your students that has caused an upteenth of vaccine injuries::: as well as deaths as listed in VAERS::: a federal injury database.  Respect one‚Äôs right to choose what is put into one‚Äôs bodies.  Adhere to the principles as set forth by VT‚Äôs 2021 Mission::: Vision & Core Values::: and eliminate the need to swerve to hypocrisy.  Please refer to this letter from Dr. Kempen::: President of Association of American Physicians & Surgeons::: with regards to your decision to mandate vaccinations.  It is imperative that VT retract from the force-feeding of ideologies that are in direct opposition to a large percentage of your university community including Alumni::: and VT parents/ guardians.

The controlled ""Town Hall"" was not productive nor satisfactory. There needs to be an open discussion.",Your Town Hall was not a discussion.

There are multiple reasons to reverse your policy. I ask you to consider the following:  Young adults are a healthy and immunologically competent and vibrant group that is at::: ‚Äúextraordinary low risk for COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.‚Äù[iv] College and University students::: however::: are under significant mental health strain already from COVID-19 fears::: circumstances::: distance learning problems and the imposition of government health policy restrictions.[v ] Even though the FDA granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for three COVID-19 vaccines::: they are not FDA approved to treat::: cure or prevent any disease at this time. Clinical trials will continue for at least two years before the FDA can even consider approval of these vaccines as effective and safe. The COVID-19 vaccines on the market in the U.S.::: mRNA (Moderna and Pfizer) and DNA (Johnson & Johnson ‚Äì Janssen)::: have caused notable side effects::: pathology and even death (4.178 deaths per VAERS as of May 5::: 2021). These adverse reactions result in absence from school and work::: hospital visits::: and even loss of life.[vi] College-age women may be at unique risk for adverse events following administration of the experimental COVID vaccinations currently available. According to the CDC::: all cases of life-threatenin g blood clots::: subsequent to receiving the J&J vaccine::: reported so far in the United States::: occurred in younger women.[vii] The vast majority of cases of anaphylaxis have also occurred in women.[viii] In addition::: ‚Äúwomen are reporting having irregular menstrual cycles after getting the coronavirus vaccine:::‚Äù[ix] and 95 miscarriages have been reported to the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Effects Reporting System (VAERS) following COVID vaccination as of April 24::: 2021.[x] Recent research data demonstrates that the spike protein::: present on the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the induced primary mechanism of action of COVID-19 vaccines::: are the primary cause of disease::: infirmity::: hospitalization and death.[xi] Students who have had self-limited cases of COVID-19 already possess antibodies::: activated B-cells::: activated T-cells (detectable by lab testing). This durable::: long-term immunity would not only prevent them from getting recurrent COVID-19::: but would also represent herd immunity to protect others in the college or university community.[xii] :::[xiii] COVID-19 convalescent students may be harmed by college and university policy requiring COVID-19 vaccines.[xiv] They already have extensive immunity and would be likely harmed from a forced confrontation with COVID-19 vaccine induced spike protein causing autoimmune reactions leading to illness and possible death.[xv] Students and their families may justifiably believe these policies discriminate against individuals who aren‚Äôt candidates for this vaccine::: have pre-existing conditions::: previous COVID-19 disease::: cite religious objections::: or are otherwise exercising their freewill choosing not to participate in this optional vaccine experiment. Refer to the Nuremberg code from WWII::: which requires individuals::: ‚Äúto be able to exercise free power of choice::: without the intervention of any element of force‚Ä¶.‚Äù[xvi] Institutional policies that permit faculty to choose or refuse vaccination::: but do not allow students the same options::: raise equal protection constitutional issues. The ADA::: Americans with Disabilities Act::: requires ‚Äúreasonable accommodations::: ‚Äù be provided based on an individual‚Äôs own unique health situation. This includes rejection of an experimental vaccine intervention which may exacerbate known health problems and thereby cause harm. Colleges and Universities should consider whether they might be liable for damages::: poor health outcomes::: and loss of life due to mandatory COVID-19 vaccination policies.[xvii] ‚ÄúPositive cases:::‚Äù as defined by laboratory testing alone::: may be false positive testing errors or asymptomatic infection that is not clinically proven to spread disease. Ambulatory outpatient early treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection / COVID-19 has been demonstrated effective in adults.[xviii] Informed consent is the standard for all medical interventions. The FDA factsheet for the healthcare provider reads::: ‚ÄúThe recipient or their caregiver has the option to accept or refuse (Pfizer-BioNTec h) vaccine.‚Äù Please reverse your decision to mandate experimental COVID-19 vaccines before more students are harmed and make the vaccines rightfully optional. Both unvaccinated and vaccinated students should be permitted on campus. Thank you for your time and attention.

It would be prudent for VT to wait until this vaccine is FDA approved!,I find it very irritating that::: for years::: people died without being able to try possibly life-saving substances because medical professionals couldn't prescribe them if they weren't FDA approved...and now non-medical professionals are mandating the requirement of non-FDA approved experimental substances as an ultimatum to existing customers who::: no doubt::: expected no less than a 4 year business arrangement. What's changed?-\-\the emergency is over. Are those that are mandating the requirement also making any outcome guarantees? The medical exemption seems to come with a price too. I am not looking forward to learning of all the long term side effects and no one being held responsible for possibly destroyed lives. The ultimatum of vax or leave is disappointing to say the least as students do more than just take classes; they join specific programs::: form significant relationships::: and invest themselves in many ways. To say vax or leave diminishes what sets VT apart from other higher learning institutions-\-\u niqueness is a good selling point. No? So::: any student that has invested in VT cannot simply go somewhere else in my opinion. I'm sure students from other colleges feel the same or they wouldn't have chosen their school. I'm currently unhappy with the choice to invest in the college and community. I hope that changes.,üî•And here's another tidbit of information::: as is my understanding: G. Gilmer Minor III is the chairman emeritus of Owens & Minor Inc (who happens to distribute the vaccines) donated $17:::000 to Mark Herring::: who's letter we are now having to address. Wondering if somewhere we stopped following science?,Federal law prohibits mandating of any treatment/ vaccine that is under EUA. Period. None of the vaccines are FDA approved to date. Doesn‚Äôt matter if they soon will be. As of today::: they are not.,VT::: get ready for a lot of angry parents::: students and alum because you are mandating an experimental medical procedure that isn‚Äôt even FDA approved! Will the university be held accountable for any injury or death that might occur? Get ready for the lawsuits::: VT!,Your body your choice. Should never be forced on anyone. The University needs to hear from parents on this. My daughter has natural antibodies and has opted not to get the vaccine. Her choice.,VT you've got a lot of angry parents and students because you are mandating an experimental medical procedure that isn‚Äôt even FDA approved,Virginia Tech is basing their decision on an *opinion* from the AG...not a legal ruling. An opinion that clearly states::: several times::: an ‚Äúapproved‚Äù vaccine. The Covid vaccine is not FDA approved::: only authorized for emergency use. Nobody should be forced to get it. And why not enforce it for your staff? They are the ones at higher risk.,Sands and Shouzock are petty tyrants making money from the taxpayers. They are not men of character in my opinion,Thank you VT.,https:// www.google.com/ amp/s/ m.jpost.com/ breaking-news/ heart-inflammati on-cases-higher -than-expected- after-mrna-covi d-19-shots-6706 74/amp,Sarah Whillock,You will not decide on my child's health choices. They have less than a 1% chance of death. The dangers of an experimental vaccine are far more concerning. For the past 20 years researchers have been unsuccessful in developing an MRNA vaccine. Just exactly what makes you think magically in 9 months this has safely been accomplished? Your body your choice. We are not anti-vaxxers. Feel free to get your experimental jab and good luck!,This is unacceptable! A forced unapproved vaccine for something that is 99.99 percent survivable?

A message from President Tim Sands regarding vaccination recommendations for employees and requirements for students attending Virginia Tech this fall ‚¨áÔ∏è  VTX.VT.EDU From President Tim Sands: COVID vaccinations required for students::: strongly urged for faculty and staff,2021-06-08 20:37:14,Human Resources Vice President Bryan Garey shares guidance on employee COVID-19 vaccination registration: https:// vtx.vt.edu/ articles/2021/ 06/ hr-garey-message -060721.html  Employee FAQs: https:// ready.vt.edu/ vaccinations/ employee-vaccine -faqs.html,Student Affairs Vice President Frank Shushok shares guidance for students on vaccine requirements and registration: https:// vtx.vt.edu/ articles/2021/ 06/ students-shushok -060821.html  Student FAQs: https:// ready.vt.edu/ vaccinations/ student-vaccine- faqs.html,My Hokie is vaccinated and ready!! Thank you Virginia Tech! One less thing to worry about! I‚Äôve seen what Covid can do to young adults.,This is unbelievable!!! ! Requiring students to be vaccinated but not the facility or staff! You better believe I will be lawyering up if my Hokie ever has adverse reactions to this experimental shot or even get covid at school since staff can pass it on to our students.,It should not have been mandated by the school. Realistically::: it‚Äôs impossible to switch schools for those that don‚Äôt want the vaccine. This is an unfair decision. If the vaccine actually works::: those that get it are protected anyway. This decision in effect says that you don‚Äôt believe the vaccine works to protect those that chose to get it. If so::: why mandate getting it?,Our young people::: who are still growing and developing::: should not be forced to take a vaccine that is not FDA approved to remain at a school they love and have invested significant funds in to get the VT education.,Let me say it loud for those of you in the back. Becoming an adult is all about making a decision and living with the consequences of that decision. Want to get vaccinated? Great. Might there be side effects as with any medical procedure/ injection? Live with the consequences. Don't want to get vaccinated? Great. Attend a different university that doesn't also have this requirement. Live with the consequences. No one is being forced to do anything.,And there are exemptions that students can claim if they need them. Therefore::: they apply to faculty and staff as well.,If you are going to mandate this for students with the threat of expulsion::: you 100% should be mandating it for ALL employees with the threat of losing their jobs! Absolutely ridiculous that it‚Äôs only ‚Äústrongly encouraged‚Äù for employees!,Thank you. I‚Äôm happy that the students will be able to return to a normal college experience. Go Hokies!,"While our daughter and our whole household all chose to get vaccinated::: it was just that ""OUR CHOICE"". Our personal risk was greater than the average person and yet it still was a hard decision for us.  I never support force or coercion on someone else. Especially something regarding their bodies. Every student should be able to make their choice. There are risks with both choices and taking away their rights to choose is wrong imo.  I also don't believe there is a right or wrong decision for individuals taking or not taking the vaccine. Everyone should allow everyone else their choice and without judgments either way. Both sides have valid concerns.  Please try and support eachother::: be kind to one another and try to respect someone else's opinion. We've all likely had a difficult 15 months or so. Try to remember none of us are perfect and we are all just trying to do our best in a bad situation. Wishing you all good health::: happiness and a better year. ‚ù§",As a student::: I am very upset that a university of such prestige is asking me::: an online::: off campus::: OUT OF STATE student to inject a NON FDA approved vaccine into my body or else. This is highly unprofessional and an invasion of my privacy. You‚Äôre asking me to be vaccinated for choosing to stay in the comfort of my home. RIDICULOUS!,Thank you VT! A University that respects science!,Clearly some of y‚Äôall have either never experienced or forgotten what it‚Äôs like to live in a college town with packed bars and parties and all of the other crazy stuff that happens üòÇ I think it‚Äôs the right call regardless of whether students are at lower risk of being infected or severity of illness. I‚Äôve seen and heard::: not just from the news but through people I know and friends in the medical field::: how bad (and deadly) it can be. Better to be safe than sorry. My .02 ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚úåüèª Stay healthy Hokies! üß°‚ô•Ô∏è,Thank you for exemplifying our motto::: Ut Prosim::: and calling for our University family to serve the public good. Proud as ever to be a Hokie! ‚ù§ü¶Éüí™üíâ‚öï,Not worth much commentary here::: just a terrible decision that I guarantee VT officials will regret... we won‚Äôt cave and will simply find a better alternative for our daughter and watch the vax‚Äôd sheep enjoy paying an institution that makes politically driven decision to force an unproven injection on healthy teens. (Notice they don‚Äôt require faculty - haha) Comment away::: won‚Äôt be responding as will be busy withdrawing. Only wanted VA Tech officials to see opposing views.,Kudos to VT for making a science backed decision to help protect the health of students::: faculty::: staff::: and the Blacksburg community.,All the people on here in shock that VT would do this surprises the hell out of me. Rutgers was the first college to announce this requirement than the writing was on the wall as all schools would follow suit. To all those stating they will just find another school::: good luck! üòÜüòÜ,Loving all the furious comments about instituting a vaccine requirement. Some vaccines have always been required for attendence. The posters declaring they will find another school with no mandate::: I say bravo! You should transfer because you clearly have a shaky grasp on the science backing the decision.,This vaccine is a matter of life and death for the general global population. This isn‚Äôt HPV or a flu shot booster where certain populations are at risk. So for the greater good and Hokie spirit of ut prosim‚Äù those who can be vaccinated should be vaccinated. For that matter going to college is a free choice. I applaud President Sands.,Your young adult has a choice - they can be vaccinated or not. If they‚Äôre over 18 that‚Äôs their decision to make. Every choice has a consequence. If they choose not to be I‚Äôm sure they will find another school.,What about all the students who have already had the virus? Their immunity is potentially even better than those getting the vaccine.,that is insane.. luckily graduated in 2017. How could it be mandatory for students and recommended for faculty.... students are paying to go to the school.,What in the world do we do about apartment leases now? There should be an exemption form available like other colleges.,It‚Äôs not even an FDA approved vaccine::: the pandemic is practically over::: and the students were never part of the at risk group. So glad I‚Äôm out.,Is he trying to discourage me from donating to Tech? If so a job well done.,What wonderful news! Providing a safe experience for all of your students is commendable.,Once again::: my alma mater has disappointed me.,What I find most disheartening regarding this situation is the way parents and alumni are speaking to one another on this thread. My god. My 17 year old son demonstrates more self control regarding what he types in a public forum than some of you. If your kids show up to VT with lack of self control::: we will understand why.,Wow...how authoritarian. I love Virginia Tech with all of my heart but this decision disgusts me..VT has become another puppet in the liberal political machine. I'm so sad that this is the decision that was made.,We all had to be vaccinated for Kindergarten. Why fight it for college? We all had to get the meningitis vaccine too. Why fight science? Oh yeah‚Ä¶alternate facts and stupid internet sites.,This is just WRONG!!!! Very disappointed,What are you going to do when a student has serious issues from the vaccines?,Wonder how they‚Äôll handle football game attendance? No vaccine no ticket ain‚Äôt gonna fly with a lot of fans.,The timing of when Tech is forcing the students to get vaccinated is also highly suspect! Political::: Disgusting and Disappointing!.,My Hokie is fully vaccinated and we're all looking forward to a great school year - heading closer to normalcy!! üôÇ,If students are required to have vaccinations for classes on campus::: you should offer online classes to students who refuse to take them.,virginia tech has just sold out!,"These comments are severely disappointing with misinformation.   You should at least use real information to make decisions instead of ""Fauci Fear"" ü§¶",Is VT accepting all responsibilitie s if anything might occur after receiving this injection? All courses need to be an online option. This injection should not be a forced choice.,Should be requied for faculty and staff IMO,Required for students and suggested for faculty/ staff??? Seems completely backwards.,Even comments and links to relevant science is muted here. PLEASE research before you do something you cannot undo.,Why mandate it for students when their inherent risks are lower than faculty/staff? Makes no sense.,Complete violation of people's rights.,Thank you::: Virginia Tech! This Hokie Mom is very glad to hear this üß°,So you are demanding the lowest risk age group receive a vaccine that is not licensed::: not FDA approved and only suggesting staff get vaccinated ? Also::: demanding students get unapproved vaccine - huge liability for VT. The manufacturers are held harmless but institutions are not. Everyone wants money to go to students educational needs. Not attorneys. Expect better from a stem university,This is so wrong. These vaccines are experimental. No one should be required to get them. They are only approved under EUA. It should be up to each individual to decide if they want to be a human experiment. Please reconsider.,"What a sad::: sad state of affairs to see so many criticisms of this decision.  Real Hokies take ""Ut Prosim"" to heart. Serve others by getting the vaccine.  In addition to making it less likely you'll get covid::: and much::: much less likely you'll get a severe case -\-\-\-\ it makes it less likely you'll transmit it to someone else. It makes it less likely that the virus will continue to circulate and have the opportunity to mutate::: maybe to something more contagious::: or more deadly::: or something the vaccine is less effective on.",VT also is NOT accepting religious exemptions if you have not had them for previous vaccines. Unconstitutiona l and WRONG.,NOT. EVEN. FDA. APPROVED.,Very sad to force an experimental vaccine on anyone::: especially young adults ::: in which we don‚Äôt know the long term effects. If this vaccine is mandated then all vaccines should be for all children::: but that‚Äôs not the case because parents have that option for their young children. Plus the vaccine is not the end all be all::: and already has been proven to not be reliant with vaccinated people becoming COVID positive. Just a very sad state of affairs especially as our young adults are now forced with the decision of what this effect has in their future,Thanks VT. I look forward to my first in-person semester this fall!,Does anyone know of any class-action lawsuits that are being prepared? I would be grateful for any information.,What happened to ‚ÄúMy body::: My choice‚Äù? Is that just not a thing anymore?,Nice to see so much constructive dialogue from both sides on here around this contentious issue. I certainly hope the administration reviews all input and considers adjusting the policy based on the feedback and all of the available information from the medical profession. I found this one letter particularly interesting from the AAPS and am hopeful university officials have received it and would accept the invitation from these medical professionals to engage in further dialogue and provide a response to their valued community.  https:// aapsonline.org/ open-letter-from -physicians-to- universities-re verse-covid-vac cine-mandates/ ?fbclid=IwAR3r_v 34t9ZlJjAPw2XEP FcWg8OEo_4MAq3g EBOexLaOnDvYQEq cJvLJlqo,Sad::: I thought TECH was better than UVA. It seems both administrations on both sides are having zoom meetings and doing the same thing. Give the illegals and immigrants the vaccines since tax payers are paying for them. On top of that they get a free education thanks to tax payers::: must be nice.,Oh well::: other universities will benefit from this.,I am not an anti vax person at all and do believe in the science. And my student has gotten the shot along with myself. To mandate one group (the students) be required to return to college and not mandate the other group (staff) is wrong. I understand as the second group are employees and the college cannot demand them to get the vaccine. However the college can demand that if you have not been vaccinated regardless of exemptions should still have to wear a mask and remain socially distanced::: and if you fail to do so you will be disciplined like last year.,I am fine with vaccines. What I don‚Äôt get is how they are mandated for students but optional for staff. Like the staff cannot get the virus and spread it? Ut Prosim only applies to the students and not those who work on campus? Don‚Äôt get that.,the only time i ever feel embarrassed to be a hokie is when the administration posts something on facebook and groups of alumni::: parents::: and other random trolls with nothing better to do decide to turn the comments into a show of complete immaturity and lack of critical thinking. if you don‚Äôt have anything productive to say::: don‚Äôt say it!,"Not sure how you can say vaccines are required for students to ""do what's right for the public good"" but not then not require them for faculty and staff! Quite the double standard::: VT. It should be a choice for all!","This is the first time conservatives have been directly affected by something with masks or the vaccine... Why are people acting and using caparisons to an optional vaccine. A mandate of you can get around through ""religious preference"" and say this is wrong... You don't have to come to a 4 year institution::: also parents don't speak for your kids they are adults now and can make their own decisions. <3",Hmmm.. To mandate an investigational shot sounds like a risk to the school. The manufacturers have been indemnified::: but companies and schools mandating them have not. I certainly hope those at the school giving the shot is obtaining full consent from all. Brush up on what that means in the first principal of the Nuremberg Code of 1947. If not::: you could have legal issues down the line. All this makes me pause. Mandate the students::: but not the staff. When the students have less risk? Anyone petitioning?,Maybe you should ask how much money VA Tech received for mandating the vaccine? Surplus of vaccines due to expire.,Highly disappointed in the political statements my university feels compelled to continuously make.,So VT is FORCING an unapproved vaccine on students::: but not faculty and staff (because the staff would revolt)::: yet ban marijuana::: which has now been made legal (not that I support MJ legalization).. ...makes no sense,Why not require staff??,Your body your choice. Should never be forced on anyone. The University needs to hear from parents on this. My daughter has natural antibodies and has opted not to get the vaccine. Her choice.,Please explain to me why it‚Äôs only recommended for faculty and staff but required for students?,In January::: Israel became one of the first countries in the world to give the new coronavirus vaccine to young people. At the time::: Israel's Education Ministry said the vaccine was necessary so that students could sit for in-person exams. Schools mandated the shot; kids got it.  So what happened next? This week::: we found out. Israeli health officials released a report showing that vaccinated young people::: particularly young men::: were developing a potentially fatal complication ‚Äî a heart inflammation called myocarditis ‚Äî and they were developing it at extremely high rates. Researchers determined that the incidence of myocarditis in vaccinated young men was fully 25 times the usual rate. Some of them died.  In Canada::: at least one public health official observed the same thing. Dr. Peter Liu is the chief scientific officer at the University of Ottawa Heart Institute::: and an expert in myocarditis. Liu began to notice heart inflammation in patients who‚Äôd received the vaccine. ‚ÄúIt is more than coincidental:::‚Äù he said. In Germany::: authorities concluded the same thing. The German government just announced that healthy young people should avoid the vaccine. It‚Äôs too dangerous.  This is a serious development. If statistical trends observed in Israel hold here in the United States::: as many as 150:::000 young Americans will develop a potentially fatal heart disorder because of this vaccine. That‚Äôs not alarmism::: or some kind of anti-vaccine conspiracy theory. It‚Äôs real. Has VT looked into this study prior to making this decision to mandate?,So::: Germany is highly recommending that young people to not get the vaccine due to adverse affects ::: Israel has numerous studies of young men with myocarditis along with other symptoms::: more proof is coming out that if you had Covid the antibodies are still in your system and the vaccine harms you::: and finally the CDC is meeting next week to look at these numbers. All studies as of right now point to not giving young children or adults this vaccine. Half of the NIH refuses to get vaccinated. Is that a coincidence? I think not. Everyone has the right to decide what to do with their bodies and no one should be made to get something until further studies come out. Right to choose should still be an option for our adult students and ourselves.,Did VT track transmissions of Covid via the classroom setting? I have heard of a few smaller schools doing this.,"Informed consent - know the safety data So far::: the CDC has identified 226 reports that might meet the agency's ""working case definition"" of myocarditis and pericarditis following the shots::: the agency disclosed Thursday. The vast majority have recovered::: but 41 had ongoing symptoms::: 15 are still hospitalized::: and 3 are in the intensive care unit.",It‚Äôs also insulting that the majority of people who don‚Äôt want to be vaccinated with the covid vaccine are labeled ‚Äúanti-vaxxers‚Äù. That‚Äôs is such a false statement and lumping one vaccine with all vaccines is an ignorant assumption. The majority of people have no problem with vaccinations::: they‚Äôve been vaccinated and they‚Äôve had their children vaccinated. They are only ‚Äúanti-covid vaxxers‚Äù or more specifically ‚Äúanti-experimen tal vaxxers‚Äù They choose not to gamble with their lives/health and be a lab rat or guinea pig in a medical experiment for the government. No judgment for the people who choose to be apart of those experiments::: that‚Äôs your right too. I‚Äôm all for vaccinations for my entire family but I‚Äôm not going to put the lives/health of my family at risk for an experimental covid vaccine or any experimental vaccine until it‚Äôs been confirmed it‚Äôs been tested and approved like prior vaccinations. I‚Äôm trying to prevent my family being destroyed first because once the damage is done by the vaccine it can‚Äôt be undone. Is the answer a lawsuit against the responsible party? Sure but our family will still have to live with the aftermath. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm thinking about and what I‚Äôm trying to avoid. So many people are gung-ho to get vaccinated and they believe in one part of the medical science and that‚Äôs fine but I believe in another side of medical science that says something different. It doesn‚Äôt make me wrong. Just like you have done your research::: listened to the news::: asked questions from people you know etc. so have I. And no I don‚Äôt google and Wikipedia. I actually have a lot of actual real medical science at my disposal so I don‚Äôt need to look medical terms up online to see what the CDC::: or Fauci said. You can‚Äôt tell someone just because you don‚Äôt believe in God and they do they‚Äôre wrong (and vice versa).,Why did you reverse your decision? This is not FDA approved.,I wish public schools would require all vaccines to attend.,What about immunity from having had Covid? No vaccine needed. New CDC read.,Cue the sheep slobbering all over this decision to get an overpriced indoctrination! Lol.,Disappointed in my alma mater. Can't force employees cause illegal. There are medical exceptions. I knew this was coming so not surprised. Mad at sands and all the sheep believing this. I have traveled all over east coast. No mask etc still here. Grow a pair VT,This is wrong on many levels!!,I'm curious as to why they require it of students::: but only strongly recommend for faculty and staff. Regardless of your personal stance on the vaccine::: feels like the rules should be consistent across students::: faculty and staff.,And then there is this::: just released several hours ago: Biden administration says COVID-19 vaccination not a precondition to work in-person at federal buildings. Federal employees are also not required to disclose their vaccination status. I'm sure for the same OSHA reason below.,Stole this from a sub post. This needs to be seen,Right call. Conspiracy theorists will comment in 3:::2:::1‚Ä¶,Why are you forcing students to take an experimental vaccine?! What about students that have had Covid-19? You'd think a school with POLYTECHNICAL in their name would follow REAL science and not the main stream media fake science! https:// www.news-medical .net/news/ 20210608/ No-point-vaccina ting-those-whoe 28099ve-had-COV ID-19-Findings- of-Cleveland-Cl inic-study.aspx ?fbclid=IwAR1EI rtFvu2B_rItK8Sf NBJDw-5dQo11Hns LdHdTvg51BcNVrs Szgfp7vjU,Hard HELL NO!!! You‚Äôre going to be sued for mandating an experimental drug! The military::: nor has the Federal government has mandated it::: oh and to date::: neither has any state in the United States‚Ä¶. what does that tell you. Glad my 2020 ‚Äúfinisher‚Äù (since they didn't get a graduation)::: isn‚Äôt faced with having to make a potentially life altering decision in the name of higher education. Shame on you!!!!!! And somehow staff and faculty have some sort of magic protection barrier???? Kinda like the virus can infect you walking through the restaurant::: but not after you sit at the table? Follow the science::: right.... üòÇ,This is why STAFF will not be MANDATED to vaccinate: OSHA released its new guidance on April 20 under a ‚ÄúFrequently Asked Questions‚Äù section of its website having to do with COVID-19 safety compliance.  The question asks whether an employer who mandates employees receive these experimental COVID-19 shots is required to record any adverse events as a result of these injections. Such recording requirements of serious work-related injuries and illness may not only leave an employer vulnerable to worker‚Äôs compensation claims::: but such incidents could also impact the employer‚Äôs safety record.  The question and answer in full:  If I require my employees to take the COVID-19 vaccine as a condition of their employment::: are adverse reactions to the vaccine recordable?  If you require your employees to be vaccinated as a condition of employment (i.e.::: for work-related reasons)::: then any adverse reaction to the COVID-19 vaccine is work-related. The adverse reaction is recordable if it is a new case under 29 CFR 1904.6 and meets one or more of the general recording criteria in 29 CFR 1904.7.  This clarification comes as an increasing number of employers seek to mandate the experimental injections despite possible illegality. The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported this beginning trend in varieties of fields::: including machine operators::: office workers::: restaurant waiters::: and medical staff.,The injections are still in an experimental stage ::: so figure something else out::: especially for kids who dont live on campus.,Most schools already require vaccination records.,For all those saying my child got the vaccine and is fine. Sure::: they are fine now but nobody knows the long term effects of this jab. Will your child be fine in 6 months::: a year::: 10 years? No long term studies have been done on this jab. The general population is the long term study. Just pointing out the obvious.,The CDC called an urgent meeting over 226 cases of heart inflammation in teens who have had Pfizer or Moderna vaccines. They are scheduled to meet on June 18th. I don‚Äôt feel too hopeful that this will end all the mandates::: but there is a small chance it could end some of them.,Not cool VT. Very disappointing! Typical liberal crap. Not sending anymore alumni checks to VT,Look at all of this group think! Now I‚Äôm not shocked by how evil dictators came to power. Everyone just agrees with the facts and science tells a different story. I‚Äôm not saying some shouldn‚Äôt get the vaccine but based on the SCIENCE it shouldn‚Äôt be mandated because it‚Äôs not safe. Its less safe than other vaccines that were pulled. The H1N1 was pulled for far less issues.,How much money is Virginia Tech getting from the companies that make the vac?

Prominent physicians stated that vaccinating people who already have antibodies (natural immunity) is dangerous. Is Virginia Tech going to be held liable for forcing students to receive an experimental gene therapy that has no long term safety data? You would think with all the lies/deceit that has finally come out on Fauci you would not continue to take people's rights away from them. Fauci admitted that the regular masks do not stop a virus.

Continuing to call us all ‚Äúliberal sheep‚Äù will not change the risks or the deadliness of this virus.,"So VT is mandating that students take an experimental drug with NO track record to fight off a virus that has a 99.9? survival rate? Who is running VT. Do they have a science department or a statistics group to run the numbers for the knuckleheads at the top of the VT garbage heap? What a group of fools. Students need to demand that VT show the emergency conditions that require mandatory vaccination with experimental drugs with NO track record.

While face masks have proved to reduce the spread of COVID-19::: they have posed challenges for many people who rely on facial expressions and lip-reading to communicate.

Deaf and hard of hearing people need to see your whole face and mouth to understand::: even if you are signing.

Why are we not fully in-person? Enough already!,Question: so if your child has only two in person classes right now for the fall::: can we expect that the others will move to in person? I sure hope so. TIA  (I understand that the university offers some virtual classes::: but I am asking will some classes now::: listed as virtual::: be switching to in person?),My son had in-person classes all last year at another school. For VT::: is it too hard::: or is too hard for you?,Austin Lane,Why do you say only vaccine immunity is counted for herd immunity?,Yeah!!!!! GO HOKIES!!!!,In person! Let's go!,Great!!,‚ÄúVaccinations are the key and::: as I said in my message last week::: vaccine-based ‚Äúherd immunity‚Äù will be a necessary part of full-capacity::: in-person operations. Please take advantage of the widespread availability of vaccines over the spring and summer so we can come together in the fall. Vaccination is our best way to ensure we all can enjoy more freedom and the activities that connect us.‚Äù  Translation.... we are being pushed to push the vaccine.

As Virginia Tech prepares to close out the spring 2021 semester::: plans and preparations continue for a fall 2021 semester that more closely resembles the classroom experiences and campus activities students enjoyed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.  VTNEWS.VT.EDU Plans::: preparations continue to move Virginia Tech toward an in-person fall semester,2021-04-29 16:51:58,I‚Äôd expect in person if I was still paying tuition!,More closely resembles? Better be all in-person classes or not worth going to Tech. Very little interaction with teachers for my student's freshman year.,We don't hire virtual grads from anywhere. Virginia Tech included. Online learning is useless. The university response has tainted the school. The children laughing at this don't realize the degree signifies four years of putting up with difficult people::: in person (professors)::: and the diploma signifies the ability to work through this difficult situation to completion. About 90% of people are not employed within their academic area::: so the rite of passage in trial by fire in a classroom becomes the figure of merit::: emulating office politics. Sitting at home in jammies doing virtual problems can be done by a 3rd grader so the virtual experience only degrades a degree.,Thank you for taking care of students' and facultyhealth. By the fall::: we should be ready if all cooperate with vaccinations and mask üò∑ wearing.,This is great news!,Semester::: when did VT change from quarters?,No planning to be done reopen with no pc restrictions!,Nice!,Representing::: Cancun!,My heart is happy üòä üíì,If you force the vaccine on your students and one dies or becomes permanently sick from it won't that make you responsible because you are forcing students to get it? Big pharma can not be held responsible but they do not force it on the people! Your students want to better themselves yet you are looking at turning them into guinea pigs! Shame on any of you looking to force this and taking their rights to choose!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

President Sands shares COVID-19 updates:  ‚û°Ô∏è In accordance with the CDC and Virginia Department of Health guidance::: we are relaxing the face-covering requirement outdoors on campus. ‚û°Ô∏è We are exempting Hokies who have received at least one vaccination dose from prevalence and surveillance testing.  We‚Äôve come this far by supporting each other. Let‚Äôs finish the academic year strong together!  VTNEWS.VT.EDU From President Tim Sands: Shared achievements come from supporting one another,2021-04-28 14:39:15,There is absolutely no reason college students should be required to get this vaccine. None. If you want to get it :::great! But you never required the flu shot and college students are much more affected by the flu.,If you‚Äôre requiring students to get the vax then you better require it of staff as well.,Do you anticipate that masks will be worn indoors in the fall?,What does this mean? No masks outdoors on campus IF you had at least one dose of the vaccine?,This makes sense to me. If a student needs to be vaccinated against meningitis::: etc. what is the problem with including this one?,What about graduation? if graduates are social distancing::: do they need to wear masks outside? I understand to put the mask back on when walking up to & on the stage...but with the new CDC guidelines I was wondering how that would work esp. in May with warmer weather. üôÇ,No Vac for students!!!!,What about those with medical conditions? I am ashamed of the way my alma mater handled this whole thing.,Will you be requiring the covid vaccine for next year?,Now the town of Blacksburg needs to loosen up as well.,Y‚Äôall are an embarrassment. Had to follow the sheep ‚Äúguidelines‚Äù which included absolutely zero science in order to keep your state funding eh?,This totally won‚Äôt backfire at all,About time!!!üôÑ,They were never needed outside to begin with.

Virginia Tech employees: Please take a moment to complete this brief three-question survey on whether you have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine and::: if you have not::: whether you plan to be vaccinated in the near future.  The purpose of the survey is to estimate the proportion of our community at large that will be vaccinated by the start of the summer. Data collected will not be attributed personally in our analysis nor will it be saved for future use.  An estimate of the proportion of the community that has been vaccinated will facilitate our ability to assess health safety risk and develop data-driven plans for the summer and fall semester.

Virginia Tech is an amazing place- more than just a great university for most of us...it's a second home.  As for the rest of our country::: these issues still persist to date. There is plenty that can and will be done to prevent these types of events in the future. The #1 thing we can all do::: starting right now::: is be kind to everyone you meet. Give the weird kid in class a genuine smile and tell them you're glad they are there. Pay for the person's lunch at the drive-thru and pass them a note to let them know they matter. Just talk to people that no one else talks to. Planting seeds of kindness now can help prevent events like April 16::: 2007 from happening in the future.

Town of Blacksburg Government's Amended Emergency Ordinance 1956 does not apply to Virginia Tech operations and will not impact events such as commencement.  Town of Blacksburg Government March 24::: 2021 at 10:12 AM ¬∑  üîµ Amended Emergency Ordinance 1956 Clarification üîµ  Because some confusion has resulted from the Town Council‚Äôs action to approve Amended Emergency Ordinance 1956::: the Town is providing the following clarifications.  The Town's emergency ordinance does not apply to Virginia Tech operations and will not impact events such as graduation.  All of the measures in the emergency ordinance have been in place since first adopted by the Town Council in August of 2020 before the students returned to Blacksburg. The limit on gatherings (50 persons) remains in place due to Blacksburg‚Äôs unique circumstances as a college town and the prevalence of COVID-19 cases in the student population.  The Town‚Äôs emergency ordinance is consistent with the current Governor‚Äôs order except for the limit on large outdoor gatherings (a limit of 50 instead of the 100 persons permitted on April 1). This is to prevent large private gatherings/parties that could continue the spread of COVID-19 in the student population. This limitation does not apply to the operation of food establishments or businesses.  Town staff is directly coordinating with Virginia Tech to plan for successful in-person graduation ceremonies and will welcome graduating students and their families to Blacksburg in May.  More information will come out in the coming weeks as Virginia Tech announces plans for graduation week.,2021-03-24 18:27:05,Stay outside of the town limits. Hit them in the pocket book!

VTNEWS.VT.EDU A message from President Tim Sands and Vice President Menah Pratt-Clarke,2021-03-04 13:55:31,Help me understand why anyone would have issues with this statement...,"Where was this energy when my bf and I were harassed over the summer by a Tech student? He scream at us ‚Äúf*** you. You are Asian‚Äù  His suspension from student conduct was reduced when he appealed because his original sanction was deemed ‚Äúunduly harsh and arbitrary‚Äù even though in the Hokie‚Äôs Handbook it states ""Any violation of the Virginia Tech Student Code of Conduct Motivated by an individual's... genetic information::: national origin::: political affiliation::: race...will be deemed an aggravating circumstance and will subject the student to a sanction more severe than would be imposed in the absence of such motivation.""

Because statewide restrictions of in-person gatherings remain in effect::: 2021 Virginia Tech graduates will be honored during an online spring University Commencement ceremony on May 14 at 6:15 p.m::: with possible in-person moments for grads if restrictions loosen by May.  If campus and community members remain vigilant and follow masking::: distancing::: and gathering guidelines while vaccine distribution efforts expand ‚Äî and case numbers in the community decline sufficiently ‚Äî university leaders anticipate that event limitations could continue to ease and make small graduation gatherings possible.  Plans to host in-person activities::: as permissible::: will be announced at vt.edu/commencement as the commencement date nears.  VTNEWS.VT.EDU Virginia Tech plans possible in-person events with a virtual spring 2021 commencement ceremony,2021-03-03 01:02:22,This announcement shows a complete lack of innovation on the part of VT administration & is frankly infuriating. We expect the students to innovate and learn from good examples. I expect the same from VT administration::: who have lost my trust with this announcement.  Student only department ceremonies are possible NOW. Each department is small and each department traditionally does a ceremony. It is the department ceremony students remember long after graduation. Let the big ceremony in Lane be split or virtual & give the students department ceremonies with their peers. Use West Point or ANY of the other military academies as an example - all of which had ceremonies last spring. My younger daughter‚Äôs HIGH SCHOOL had an in-person::: student-only ceremony LAST SPRING::: with NO COVID cases after::: for 260 students - bigger than many VT departments. As a senior parent::: I will give up being there::: if my daughter can have a ceremony with peers & have the experience she‚Äôs earned.  This announcement is completely unacceptable. The students have lost too much already and VT has the obligation to do better. As an alumni parent::: I find the timing suspect - right after Giving Day???? At this point::: I have such bad feelings::: I don‚Äôt know how I can continue to talk up VT to the accepted HS seniors on my robotics team and I feel tricked by the ‚Äújust after‚Äù Giving Day timing. I am disgusted by the lack of effort on the part of VT - it‚Äôs time to step up and SERVE your students::: not subject them to this unbelievable DISSERVICE.,Thank you VT! I think some folks struggle to understand the many dynamics of planning involved and sheer volume of people involved with graduation. 500:::000 people are dead from this virus and I never thought my PhD::: my 3rd degree at tech::: would end this way. But I am grateful to VT and believe the admin is trying to make graduation special while living ut Prosim::: which means embracing our commitment to being a responsible institution and responsible community members. Thank you for the ride!,Have graduation and let families decide if they want to attend,Completely unacceptable! For $50k per year::: you should be able to come up with something much better than this! You are taking the easy and lazy way out when many other schools have planned in person events. There are ways for this to be done safely. Not even trying is not an option.,Thank you fir caring about all Hokies and their families!,This is so heartbreaking::: we went through this last year when our son graduated from Virginia Tech::: I am so sorry for all of the the seniors and their parents::: I know what you are feeling right now and just so you know you will get angrier and angrier::: that being said know that only 6.7% of the world‚Äôs population graduates with a bachelors degree::: you and your son or daughter should feel nothing but pride and know that you are acknowledged. üß°‚ô•Ô∏è,JMU is hosting a grad walk in April to at least allow students to participate in walking and having their name called? It‚Äôs already devastating enough that we had to miss out on this last year for my brother who worked so hard at VT::: try to do something like that. I‚Äôm sure someone at JMU would be more than happy to give you all some pointers.,Why not split everyone by last name and have multiple in-person college graduations. Half of the students may not come anyways (not comfortable)::: and have us RSVP to get a ticket to be able to come with only 2 tickets for parents. That way we can at least have some sort of in-person ceremony but we'd be broken up enough that we could hold multiple sessions. At least that way since the colleges are smaller we could hold something versus a huge university commencement. There are ways to solution this::: VT just doesn't want to spend the resources.,Since Lane stadium holds 60:::000+ people::: why not have graduation for our 7:::000 graduates there if state restrictions ease? There would be plenty of room to social distance. I wouldn't mind streaming the ceremony if it means our graduates can have some sense of normalcy. Please reconsider VT.,So disappointing for the Seniors and their families. Seems like VT could‚Äôve come up with some type of in person ceremony. Texas A&M is spreading their‚Äôs out over several days and they have about 15:::000 graduates...,It is an absolute disgrace! I hope going forward that all these graduates remember that the governor took away their freedoms and rights!,So if UNC Chapel Hill can figure out how to have graduation with a smaller stadium than Lane by spreading it over 4 days & limiting each grad to 2 guests with DR FAUCI as one of their speakers so can Virginia Tech! Do better VT!,Why not let the students graduate in person and the families watch virtually?! They have all been there at school anyway. This is a good idea worth considering.,I just Graduated in December with an online commencement and it was so hard to be happy and excited for that. I also had my middle name mispronounced ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü•∫,If it is ok to have 1000 people at VT baseball games::: then it is very much ok to have 1000 people (or more) in Lane stadium. Do the right thing- allow these kids to celebrate their accomplishments . Let them jump in Lane stadium. Do not cheat them out of a once in a lifetime event. The fact that VT is not planning in person events while other schools are is something they will not soon forget. After giving up so much for the last year::: they deserve extra effort on your part to mark this milestone- in person. They love their school and Hokie Nation. Please do the right thing and help them celebrate together.,There is no need to continue the rhetoric of mask up and social distancing. Other states have opened up. Virginia Tech promotes innovation- there are a lot of great ideas here. So use them!,I‚Äôm so disappointed for our graduates!!!! Rules are being loosened elsewhere üòû...,I‚Äôm sorry to sound ungrateful but my daughter received communication they want to give the class of 2020 a party so they can drink and dance. We did not pay $60k+ for a party-that was included in the college experience. Her department has a total if 200 graduates for 2020 and 2021. There is no reason not to give these young adults who have worked so hard for this a proper graduation. If you have to do it over a week or 2 weeks::: THEN DO IT!! I will gladly sit in the heat to see my daughter walk to get her degree!! I have no problem wearing a mask if that‚Äôs what it takes. Lane Stadium is large enough to do proper social distancing and you limit each graduate to 2 guests. It does not take a rocket scientist to figure this out. This is what happens when you have too many liberals running the show.,Online commencement decision final? Or it can change?,This Alum is highly disappointed in her Alma Mater üò£. Poor kids......guess DC reached down deep into Va.,A school with an engineering program and medical school couldn't figure out how to use a giant football stadium to let people have a ceremony outside given over a year?,One lesson that I have learned during my time at VT is to stand up for what I am passionate about and THIS fits that category. I simply cannot understand how VT thinks this is acceptable after knowing that this pandemic is our new reality for several months now. They have had OVER A YEAR to prepare and make accommodations::: yet it continues to become more and more evident that the priority is money::: rather than caring for students. I wouldn't change anything about my time here::: however::: I hope that #VT25 is paying attention to these decisions that the school is making::: and heavily considering how they may be treated if they choose tech as their new home in the fall.,Very disappointing! Other universities are looking ahead with positivity. Princeton in NJ::: West Chester in PA have announced in person commencements and Penn State is planning.,Pathetic::: 500k deaths in the US alone::: and people are still thinking of only themselves. I'm ashamed to have graduated from the same university as you lot.,I should have sent my child to college in a red state. Ga Tech had in person graduation in December. You can make it happen if you TRY and have a governor with a brain.,Why not Covid test everyone. Again. Required. Show your test/ vaccine card/ antibody test. Everyone wear a mask? Make it hybrid as w classes... huge costly deal is the way I see it and many may choose not to attend anyway. We must face it ..graduation is a bigger deal for families mostly. our two kids are feeling very fortunate to be in class this semester in person at all. Sad but the current fate of a huge school like tech. Find your joy another way.. hold a contest for the best alt graduation ideas... make us get creativeüôèThank you for keeping our students staff city county and state SAFE.,I‚Äôd encourage anyone complaining on this post to reflect on what Ut Prosim means. Think about how thousands of people traveling to Blacksburg could impact the people who live there full time. The pandemic is still very real::: and hospital systems are still overwhelmed. I made the best out of virtual graduation last year and actually had a great time celebrating at home with my family. I respect Virginia Tech for taking the appropriate measures to protect Blacksburg during this time.,You had any entire year to figure this out. You‚Äôve failed your students VT.,This was a gutless easy way out for VT. Have a graduation like other schools.,such a terrible decision. Shame on you. Way to kill more downtown businesses also.,As an alumni::: living in Texas....this makes me very sad. My niece has spent the majority of her Va Tech experience in this crazy land. So much is out of your control....but you can do better. Come on::: Va Tech....step up.,How did we have spectators for FOOTBALL but you can‚Äôt plan enough social distance in Lane Stadium for graduation?,Worst mistake of my life was going to Tech. What about Ut Prosim Tech? You aren‚Äôt serving or helping us seniors.,So you took away my whole senior year and gave us all the hopes of a possible in person graduation to take that away. I paid a ridiculous amount of money for this year to just be doing all my work from my apartment. Just remember any email that is ever sent asking for donations I will laugh at and remember how I was treated my senior year.,People should think more seriously about who they vote for next time around. Thanks King Northam,VCU is having in person graduation üë©‚Äçüéì,How can people continue to be okay with this? This is a huge milestone for our kids!!! Just because a liberal governor and a liberal university president think it‚Äôs ok to squash the dreams of kids doesn‚Äôt make it the right thing to do. Elderly parents and grandparents stay home from graduation. It‚Äôs been a YEAR!!!! Time to get back to normal!!! Ridiculous!!!,I think the class of 2021 parents and students should petition. If two of the largest universities in Florida have decided to hold in person graduations::: so can VT.

I remember at the parent orientation::: when they told us the most commonly asked question is ‚ÄúWhat is a Hokie‚Äù? After dealing with VT and their policies::: I now know.  A ‚ÄúHokie‚Äù is a cross between a parasitic garbage bird (think seagull or pigeon)an ostrich (head in the sand) and a Dodo (a bird that became extinct because it was fat::: flightless::: clueless and clumsy).,I am an alumni. My two older children are graduates of VT. My third was rejected. So sorry VT but the money is no longer going to VT. The Northern VA admissions counselor is horrible- only interested in diversity and not in the finding the best candidates. It makes me sick that this is how VT is treating their alumni. I even have an email from this horrible admissions counselor to my child which was rude. So no more family season tickets for us to Hokie games. No more donations. We are putting it all into UVA where she was accepted with scholarship. VT is not the college it used to be.,Alum and parent of current VT student. no money from us until you allow students freedom.

Due to forecasted inclement weather conditions::: the Blacksburg Virginia Tech campus will be closed tomorrow::: Feb. 18.  All day and evening classes::: regardless of modality (in person::: hybrid or online) have been canceled. All university events scheduled are also canceled. ‚ùÑÔ∏è  For more information visit vt.edu/status.,2021-02-17 20:41:21,Oh brother. Most students have classes on line and we are expected to lose power and internet in the ice build up. It's not about walking in the snow üôÑ,Hopefully the power will stay on. I remember living in West Egg during the blizzard of 93 (or was it 94) and the campus lost power and we were sent home early for Spring Break. And then we were delayed returning from Spring Break because of a snow storm. Good times. The campus was so beautiful when it snowed.,Dear everyone saying they were at tech during the 60s-90s and never had classes canceled: 1. We are so much online that if the electricity goes out::: most classes wouldn't have students in them let alone professors. 2. Times are different and things change. If you want to argue that::: take that up with your God or higher power. Please don't let me know how it goes. 3. Students now are expected to be more and do more than you were so ease up on the judgment.,Weak. I went there 10 years ago and the campus never closed due to weather from what I remember. Power and internet are pretty reliable in Blacksburg. Trudging through snow to class should stay part of the campus experience. Next you're going to tell me the Pritchard vs Cadet Corp snowball fight is no more.,I was there from 2004-2008::: and as long as buses could run their routes::: the campus was open. Being in the Corps::: and doing Army ROTC::: we were up for PT long before they made any decisions about delays or campus closures::: and were outside at time in negative temperature wind chills. The Officer of the Day would dictate the uniform for morning formations based an automated telephonic report from Roanoke (which is always warmer than Blacksburg)::: so we‚Äôd be going to formation in much colder temperatures than the report stated.,Back in my day we had to cross the Drill Field that had no paths::: in the slush and mud::: sometimes on our hands and knees squinting into blowing snow::: through the small stream that always developed from snow melt::: carrying our boxes of punch cards for programming class (had to dry them out on radiators when we got there)::: all the while fighting off starving wolves and cougars that came down from the hills in search of cafeteria scraps!,Everyone is claiming VT never cancelled when they went there::: but I remember sitting in the TV lounge between East and West AJ in 1987 watching the Super Bowl and it being announced that classes were cancelled the following day.,It was believable until the wildlife coming for cafeteria scraps- they would run the other direction,I believe it was in 1974 or 75::: coming back from thanksgiving::: terrified driving across Afton mountain-total whiteout; back on campus::: classes were cancelled on Monday and there were the most amazing snowmen (and ‚Äúparts‚Äù of men!) and snow sculptures all over the drillfield. Great memories! Walking home from working at the library late during exams‚Äîpainfully cold.,I'm not making this observation to draw anyone's derision::: but this is Facebook so we'll see what happens.  Many of the comments about classes not being cancelled in 19XX precede the ADA becoming law. There's a notable difference between how the University handled inclement weather when I was a student and how they have handled it since I became a member of the faculty. It's a net positive.,We were there in 1958 and classes were not cancelled; we walked across the drill field with strong winds. It was unbearable::: but we did it!,CLOSED?? Are you kidding? We had classes even when snow was waist high!! Back in those days a lot of where there are steps now::: we‚Äôre just paved over hills. We would have to take a running start to scramble up those hills that were nothing but a sheet of ice. We either made it::: or wiped out swooshing to the bottom and have to start all over again. And we did it in silence. We were bundled so tightly including our faces and mouths::: no one would have heard our cries for help anyway!,I can remember classes being canceled once in the mid 80‚Äôs. This was because it was so cold that the infirmary (Henderson Hall) couldn‚Äôt handle all of the students who had frost bite. I also remember almost crawling across the Drill field during an icy January afternoon in 1982 trying to get to McBryde for a class only to discover class was canceled because the professor couldn‚Äôt get to campus. It was a LONG walk back to WAJ that day... ü•∂,I remember going to class during Hurricane Hugo. They didn't decide to cancel class until after 8am. There were whole sections of forest blown over like matchsticks during that one. 1989,We are class of 1984. My roommate and best friend Robin Nixon Meritt from 6th grade weighed about 98 pounds our sophomore year. I would have her walk behind me across the drill field so she wouldn't blow over. Our eyelids and nostrils freezing. They did cancel class one day junior year when we got 18 inches plus of snow.,Winter quarter 76. It did not get above 32 f for nineteen consecutive days in January. Tech closed for something like the third time in 103 years. No BT back then.,I don't remember classes ever being canceled. Except for the time Williams Hall got occupied by Vietnam war protesters. And that was just the classes in Williams!,In the early 70‚Äôs we lowered our heads and leaned into the wind to cross the drill field. Sans sidewalks.,Grandfather class of 1917::: dad class of 1958::: hubby class of 1979 never cancelled class for weather!! My dad walked to the old dairy barn in the winter not just across the drill field.,Too soft these days in the 80s we went to class with our eyelids frozen together crossing the drill field,Don‚Äôt mean to pile on::: but classes are never cancelled at Tech... what makes this different... I showed up... so should they.,With up to a half an inch of ice expected it‚Äôs more about losing power and not being able to attend class. My friend in blackstone has been without power since last Saturday and they are getting more ice tonight,This doesn't really matter to many students since they aren't going anywhere near campus anyway. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,I‚Äôm not going back that far but from 2000-2003 we still had classes as well. I do remember being off the day of 9/11 and the day after.,I had to go to class in the blizzard::: up hill both ways! Lol,I remember a big ice storm in ‚Äò94 shutting us down. Fortunately::: I was great at finding toilets nobody knew about! Otherwise::: the stalls serving the women on my half of the floor in Johnson were mounds of stuff nobody wanted to see...,The permanent scar VT gave me on my left hand says this is a good idea. The alum in me says this is a rite of passage and you aren't a Hokie unless you've been at least mildly injured by the campus during a storm.,Change of heart from my days I‚Äôm college! School was never canceled.,Class of‚Äô77. NEVER had classes cancelled!,It was big news when they did cancel class in 78‚Äô. Yep. Never cancelled. We sucked it up and used dining hall trays for sleds.,Give these kids a break !!! Well deserved,"Two cancellations between '81-'85. First for 12"" of snow in 1 hour. Second for temps of -10 or so with horrendous wind chill::: and BT couldn't get buses started.",No takesie backsies. Worst day ever. I left the empo cuz classes were cancelled...exc ept SIKE! They uncancelled. And once you leave the empo once in a day::: your soul can‚Äôt handle a return trip ü§£,73-77. Only cancellation was when your brain cancelled class to sleep in. Never hsd a class canceled by the university .,Snow never stopped anything ‚Äò58-‚Äò62. Especially the snow divers in their bathing suits! From the 2nd floor dorms into 6‚Äô snow drifts!,I don‚Äôt think the snowball fight will be canceled!,It‚Äôs not just students who go to Virginia Tech. Thank you for thinking about the Staff::: Professors and others who keep the campus running.,Heenal remember senior year when they sent that email on how to identify if someone is experiencing hypothermia üôÉ,üôÑ This didn‚Äôt happen in the 1970s! üôÑ,I agree with Larry. It was the coldest I have ever been in 2 feet of snow.,Walking up the hill to McBride from the drill field before there were steps! Pulling yourself up by the railing and trying not to slide back down!,Back in my day::: classes weren't cancelled (which actually wasn't that long ago...),Just saw the news...2 inches of sleet with 6 inches of snow...thanks but I will stay home...,I thought that‚Äôs why you brought boots to Blacksburg ü§î,Wish my university thought we deserved a snow day,Welcome to the age of soft VT. Got two feet my freshman year and closed for a half a day. üòÇ,Jenna Ann they never canceled class when we were there üò© even with like 15 inches of snow,But not Admissions..... Admissions isn‚Äôt closed....right ?,What? Get to those 8 o‚Äôclocks and suck it up wussies!,Ps no walkways back then,WTF - just get on with it. Geesh. (From a Vermonter ...),Why would you cancel online classes??,Same fairytale my dad told us!üòú,...snow and cold winds...,70‚Äôs tooüòÄ,Must be nice - didn‚Äôt happen with us Savannah Dotson,VTCC Echo co 65-67.

Given the uncertainty over the spread of more potent coronavirus variants::: President Sands reminds Hokies to continue to #BeCommittedBeWell and not let their guard down.  Beginning immediately::: we will also double our prevalence and surveillance testing::: increasing the frequency and number of tests for students and high-contact employees.  VTNEWS.VT.EDU From President Tim Sands: Increased testing and vigilance required::: COVID variants presumed to be in region,2021-02-16 16:49:13,ICYMI::: Linsey Marr explains current research on mask-wearing: https:// www.facebook.com /virginiatech/ posts/ 1015924655860805 4,What‚Äôs the point with no in-person classes?,VirginIa Tech::: your statement seems extremely shortsighted::: with no information shared about the very near future::: 3 - 8 months out. The lack of communication will seriously jeopardize your academic recruitment for the incoming freshmen class. Currently::: universities from out of state are actively communicating with perspective students::: stating their university will be open for in-class instruction in the summer and fall. In all seriousness::: why would a young adult want to attend a university where they risk suspension for simply having one too many people in their dorm room::: when other universities are providing the opportunity of returning to some hope of normal? I understand that Governor Northam controls what happens to the university::: however has the board actually spoken directly to the Governor and shown how much money Tech is bleeding out?,What are the metrics for lifting these restrictions::: not increasing them? Cases in VA are half of what they were a month ago. VT needs to be transparent. For a university which claims to be elite in the sciences they seem to have thrown actual science out the window in lieu of fear.,Please use the surveillance to guide the ultimate goal of returning to class in person::: in addition to respecting the severity of the virus. This issue needs a risk based approach.,When are we getting vaccines though??? üòï,"CV19 is 99.7% survivable::: has about 1/2 dozen different treatments::: and has increasingly LESS severity the younger the demographic. To continue this prolonged police state is to deny everything we::: as a Nation::: have learned over the course of the past year. Not a ""good look"" for a university that is supposed to venerate science and research.",Is there a plan in place to get the students vaccinated?,How many students or staff have been hospitalized? It‚Äôs cold and flu season::: BTW.,Updates about spring commencement? Online? In person?,Virginia Tech you had over a year to figure out some sort of graduation even if it‚Äôs done outside by school major. It‚Äôs just ridiculous. Paying out of state tuition and there may be no graduation. Go speak to Northam and figure something out. If Brown can do it so can you. Put effort into it instead of easy excuses.,Will need to seriously talk with mine about a gap year.,Someone is going to have a lot of apologizing to do once the truth comes out. And it is going to come out. The thousands of doctors trying to get through to the public are being heard. It‚Äôs easier to be fooled than trying to convince someone they‚Äôve been fooled. Time will surely tell.,What PCR threshold are the VT labs using? Cases in Va::: and nationwide::: are down to half what they were a month ago.,At the end of the day - if you don‚Äôt like the decisions of the school - you have an option for your kid not to go. They are doing the best they can.,We‚Äôre all ‚Äúover it‚Äù. Get back to in person learning (without the useless masks).,They should all be tested::: frankly when available they sho7ld all get vaccinated.,Please stop the fearmongering and propaganda.,Anyone who thinks we can stop this at this point is fooling themselves.,Increase vigilance in the integrity in all your departments as well::: then maybe we can get somewhere productive with research being applied instead of circling back to contract opportunities more regularly...,üôÑ,"meanwhile at Virginia Tech (see post from yesterday)...."" Let's hug and pose for a picture."" It's as if the masks negate the need for social distancing. Maybe if we wear 5 masks everyone will be fine? Come on Virginia Tech::: if you're going propagandize::: at least keep it consistent.",I would pull my child out of there with any mandatory testing. Stop the hysteria!,Real quick - can everyone commenting on this post let me know where they were able to get their Epidemiology degree so quickly and for free? It‚Äôs currently taking me quite a while::: with all of the reading and research::: and it‚Äôs pretty darn expensive. Plus::: you all clearly learned more than the vast majority of scientists on this planet and that‚Äôs so impressive! I‚Äôd love to switch to whatever degree program everyone else went through!

In spring 2019::: Hokies in the VT Corps of Cadets started the Black Cadet Organization (BCO) as a way to bring Black cadets together. Today::: the BCO has grown into a group of cadets who celebrate Black culture and offer support to all cadets.  VTNEWS.VT.EDU Black Cadet Organization provides community for all cadets,2021-02-15 20:01:11,We ask our community to remember::: embrace::: and embody the Virginia Tech Principles of Community every day ‚Äî and especially during these times. This is a reminder that we reject all forms of prejudice and discrimination and we take individual and collective responsibility for helping to eliminate bias and discrimination. It is critical for Hokie nation to come together to create a culture of civility in our communities and across the country.  We remind our online community to abide by our commenting guidelines::: found in our page‚Äôs About section: https:// www.facebook.com /virginiatech/ about  Comments may be removed if they are off-topic::: defamatory::: an unauthorized commercial solicitation::: or an attack::: or if they contain illegal suggestions or use foul language. We reserve the right to terminate access to the page by repeat offenders.,It's great to see that there are enough AfAm Cadets to form this community. I hope the community will grow. Sixteen percent of the military is Black. This is a great step. Don't be afraid of it. Celebrate it.,What the point to join Cadets::: wear the same uniform::: shave our head as freshman::: and do all other same stuff....,What a wonderful story of students lifting and supporting each other! Its great that Virginia Tech students can create communities that foster growth and understanding.,So Virginia Tech are you going to take down the comments that are considered hate speech or what? Aren‚Äôt we all allowed opinions without being hated on?,The comments here are ridiculous. Y‚Äôall don‚Äôt have a problem with the Black Greek clubs::: or Black Student Union at VT::: so why do you care about this one so much?!?! These Black Cadets absolutely started something great and I hope it grows and does great things! I hope it help attracts more Black Cadets too! You people with your white agendas need to crawl in a hole and go away.,This is an organization that was created by Black cadets. So they clearly felt there was a NEED for this organization. All of us non-Black non-cadets should have a seat so we can listen and learn.,"My understanding is that the Military (and by extension the Corp of Cadets) all have a conformity and a goal of ""one purpose"" in their DNA. If you want a different Sorority or Fraternity::: then join THAT::: not the Corp. The Corp is its own Fraternity::: and there should not be sub-fraternitie s within that group. The woke social experiments of the left do not win us wars. Dividing us into subgroups does not win us wars. Ultimately I want those who follow the path of the military to be the meanest::: baddest::: most-efficient instruments of destruction for our nation's enemies. If that is not your plan::: then you need another ""club"".",I initially had a long::: well-written comment to address the ignorance of some of these comments. I've decided to refrain and want to emphasize further my astonishment at how this school managed to let some of y'all leave Blacksburg with a degree when it is abundantly evident that many of you possess not even an iota of critical thinking skill.,"Wow::: there is some serious racism going on here. If a bunch of people want to have create a club to support each other::: why do you care? Are you a student? Are you a part of the group? If not::: what does it matter to you what what they do? They aren't hurting you or some how using up your ""rights"". It's not pie::: people. There's plenty of room for everyone.",It‚Äôs not racist to form a Black Cadet organization the same way it‚Äôs not sexist to form a Women in Science organization. The Black students in the Corps are forming an organization to connect::: lift one another up::: form professional relationships::: and friendships with people who come from a similar background and might have similar experiences in the Corp. I don‚Äôt see any men banging down the door at Women in Science meetings I attend::: claiming our work to support one another in science is sexist::: so I‚Äôm not really sure why some of y‚Äôall commenting have a problem with Black student organizations.,There are a lot of silly comments on this thread. This group provides some support for students that feel they benefit from it. Seems to be a positive contribution,Equality IS without Qualification or Constraint & it is within Each to make that Reality...,"Shouldn't the Corps be a community of togetherness? If not::: perhaps that should be addressed by Corps leadership. The quote in 3rd paragraph of article is concerning::: e.g.::: ""...safe space...lacking ..."" Let's support all within the Corps.",Great idea  All the best to these young people,"Imagine if there were a ""White Cadet Organization""? Imagine the outrage. It's time to STOP the race division. We are all humans.",So what if a white core of cadets start up? Is this not separating people more and more? The separation has to stop on both sides.,In my opinion this is a form of racism. What do you think would happen if another race did this? In the military everyone is supposed to be color blind,Racism goes all directions..... .no group should be labeled black or white ....PERIOD ..THIS CREATES DIVISION,Morgan Freeman: ‚ÄúStop talking about it. I'm going to stop calling you a white man::: and I'm going to ask you to stop calling me a black man. I know you as Mike Wallace. You know me as Morgan Freeman.,Yes we are,Ummm...to all the comments... wow::: just wow.,Gotta keepem separated. Wasn‚Äôt that a song? ü§î,Sounds racist to me...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The earliest intake appointment available at Cook Counseling Center.,"Hi there. I seem to not be able to get answers regarding the continued hold up on VA certifications. As a full-time student::: the 2-month (and counting) delay in these certifications is causing financial hardship. I've emailed the Veterans department with no answer. I did leave a voicemail today::: and do not expect a call back until normal business hours by my account is still showing ""being processed"". This should not be happening. Can we get some answers as to why there is such a MASSIVE delay in VA certifications going on::: please::: and when can we expect someone to catch-up on the process?",A week long break in the middle of March would have been excellent for my mental health! Thanks for getting rid of it!,As smart as you folks think you are::: first take off those masks then I might listen.

Vaccines offer great promise for the months ahead::: but waiting for vaccine-induced ‚Äúherd immunity‚Äù to turn the corner is not enough in the near term. We have to do more.  President Sands reminds Hokies to continue masking::: physical distancing::: practicing good hygiene::: and avoiding large gatherings to crush COVID.

Let‚Äôs follow the science in this young demographic and get them back into the classroom for optimal learning and mental health.,President Sands sits in his castle all day acting like he has all this knowledge. If people had gotten out and exercised::: eaten healthy::: and increased their immunity to things throughout their lives instead of living in fear and being lazy::: this disease wouldn‚Äôt ever be an issue. So many people tested positive for Covid::: myself included. I have terrible breathing problems and I know many::: many other people who have some sort of physical struggle as well::: and yet the worst we got was slightly less severe than a common cold. AND I wore my mask everywhere::: and when I got it I had been at home a majority of that time. This is a complete waste of our time and has already destroyed thousands of peoples of lives. Why risk the healthy people that have given everything to make a difference to mental health struggles because of being locked inside all the time? Why are we rewarding the already lazy people acting as puppets? Tim Sands has made it clear all he cares about is his money and not any of the students. And what‚Äôs even more embarrassing is that people actually are sheep following and listening to everything he says. It‚Äôs been very clear that masks haven‚Äôt done a thing. People still transmit the disease even if they wear them. Stop living in the moment and live for the future. It‚Äôs too late to make changes to try and protect people now::: people need to live healthier to prevent all of this from being an issue in the first place. Nobody does their own research and it shows.,Does anyone have the numbers of how many students::: teachers::: workers and staff have been hospitalized or died from this virus?? Let‚Äôs get the numbers out there so we can see the stats. Just open up!!!,The ‚Äúvaccines‚Äù y‚Äôall want to wait in DOESNT STOP YOU FROM CONTRACTING OR SPREADING THE VIRUS. It‚Äôs supposed to reduce symptoms up to 50%::: when so many are already asymptomatic/ recovery rate under 70 is over 99.7%?! We are never going back to normal,Also let‚Äôs not pretend we‚Äôre the University of Phoenix Mr. S,Fauci says people still have to wear masks::: not gather and keep social distancing after the 2 doses of the vaccine that they have no data on how long it will keep you from getting really sick from covid but they also have no data yet on if the vaccine prevents you from being infected at all or if you can infect others. This is all pointless::: just go back to normal life.,If all that mask wearing::: social distancing crap worked::: the virus would be gone by now. Just open back up and give our kids the education we‚Äôre paying for ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Who the heck is going to want to get in a plane that was designed by someone who got their engineering degree ‚Äúvirtually‚Äù?!?!,Why would anybody take an experimental vaccine when there are now easy treatments if needed. Just make sure you have the right doctor and if needed then the right hospital that doesn't listen to politicians.,Open up this is ridiculous.,Oh btw::: taking care of my mental health is not wearing a stupid mask.,I was so excited for my freshman to be part of the Hokie nation! Unfortunately::: it seems that only exists when parents are happy. Are you teaching our future leaders to be angry::: disgruntled::: and distrustful? Or are our kids learning to be grateful and resilient. President Sands message is Better Together. If we can't do that as adults::: how can we expect our children to?

Because of the university‚Äôs ongoing commitment to limit the spread of COVID-19 and protect the members of our extended community::: Virginia Tech will alter its 2021 Day of Remembrance events to promote physical distancing and discourage large public gatherings.

Hokies are also encouraged to participate in the virtual Virginia Tech 3.2-Mile Run in Remembrance April 16-18.

Are you sure it won‚Äôt kill me? No  13. If statistically the virus doesn‚Äôt kill me anyway::: why would I get vaccinated? To protect others.  14. So if I get vaccinated::: is everyone sure that I‚Äôm not infecting them? No  15. So if I have a fatal reaction to the experimental vaccine will the manufacturer be held liable? No  So::: the vaccine doesn‚Äôt give immunity. Doesn‚Äôt eliminate the virus. Doesn‚Äôt prevent death. Doesn‚Äôt guarantee you won‚Äôt get COVID. Doesn‚Äôt prevent you from getting COVID. Doesn‚Äôt stop you from passing it on. Doesn‚Äôt eliminate the need for travel bans. Doesn‚Äôt eliminate the need for business closures. Doesn‚Äôt eliminate the need for lockdowns. Doesn‚Äôt eliminate the need for masks. Doesn't hold vaccine manufacturers liable  So...why should I take an experimental vaccine? Everyone has a choice and it‚Äôs your choice.,Get it if u want. I‚Äôm not::: but some people get flu vaccines every year and seem sickies to me. Boost immune system with good foods::: exercise::: sleep::: sunshine::: vit C::: D::: zinc and elderberry.

A message from Virginia Tech President Tim Sands on the violent events at the U.S. Capitol yesterday.  Full message: vtnews.vt.edu/articles/2021/01/president-jan721-statement,2021-01-07 11:20:00,Well said::: Mr. Sands::: and I trust you sent a message out like this while cities were set on fire and livelihoods were taken away from Tax paying small business owners who were just trying earn a living and put food on their tables. I do hope you condemn all media inaccuracies and all violent protests which were evident the past few years. If you posted a previous message re: those incidences then I am disappointed that I missed it. Glad you are addressing it today. (Class of ‚Äò88),Well said. Good for you for trying to be a part of the solution rather than part of the problem.,You wouldn‚Äôt condemn right wing extremists when they presented themselves in your own school in the form of Mark Neuhoff::: but sure here‚Äôs your pat on the back for not even beginning to breach the bare minimum in a time of crisis.,So::: was this same statement put out when BLM and Antifa burned businesses and cities for weeks on end this past summer? I sure hope so::: if not you are hypocrites to the fullest degree.,Needs to be at all levels of education! Great message.,As the parent of a recent graduate I want to express my gratitude for the excellent undergraduate education my son received at VT. We have discussed many current events lately and I have been so impressed with his breadth of understanding and compassion. Thank you!,Who cares what VT President thinks? I am not reading this because his opinion matters no more than anyone else's. Get back to education and football.,Stop making excuses & bringing up other acts of violence. We condem that as well. This is about a coup attempt & thwarting our democracy. Just because you believe in conspiracy theories doesn't make them true or justifies trying to stop Congress & the peaceful transfer of power. We are a country of law and order.,Great job in releasing this statement! Also::: great job realizing that you needed to release a statement now - and not during the protests and riots months ago...because you recognized the huge empathetic difference!,Dr. Sands::: I have praised VT in the past for being progressive and showing leadership. This statement however is so lukewarm its infuriating. There is no other side here-\-\there is unconstitutiona l and there is right. A free election was held. A clear winner emerged. Casting doubt on a system-\-\but only unilateral doubt-\-\is not critical thinking. I refuse to listen to fiction.,So many of these comments are incredibly tone deaf and offensive. Protesting the violence that Black Americans have faced for centuries in this country is different than domestic terrorists staging a coup in our nation‚Äôs capital because they‚Äôre upset with the election results and scared of a party that actually wants to create good and lasting change. It also says a lot that so many of you are more concerned with personal property than the dignity and strength of our country::: which came under attack yesterday. Careful y‚Äôall::: your racism is showingüëãüèª,Y‚Äôall who are condemning this statement maybe should do some research on what was said/done by the University this summer. I‚Äôm not saying you‚Äôll like it or agree with it::: but if you‚Äôre asking whether they did anything this summer::: you haven‚Äôt looked into it. Take the time to look it up.,Peaceful protests are one thing. Violence is another. Violence should never be condoned.,Yesterday‚Äôs events were an attempt by the President to violently overthrow the legislative branch of government and subvert the democratic process. Remove him from office::: and prosecute him for treason.,How about you stick to education VT? Not every political moments requires the school to chime in.,While I agree with you on yesterday‚Äôs violence (not the peaceful protest going on)‚Äîwhy did you not speak out against the violence-riotin g::: burning::: looting::: destruction of businesses and property ::: insult and injury to our police officers and others this past year? Maybe you did so but I‚Äôm not aware.,Have you commented on the violent events in portland or seattle or minneapolis? just wondering. I saw a mostly peaceful protest.,Would be really great if Virginia Tech could handle it's own issues::: within it's grasp::: as well. Like not letting rapists off the hook with a hand slap::: and letting them return to campus.,I‚Äôve been a HOKIE long before Mr head in the Sands came to Blacksburg. This statement from you is dumber than dumb. Where were your statements against all the violence for the past 4 years. Although I will never condone any violent act yesterday‚Äôs may have come from the examples seen and nothing has been said including YOU. Sit down and shut up!!,Thank you and we‚Äôll said. Proud to be a Hokie.,Start by STOPPING the liberal indoctrination in our education system. Teach REAL history::: civics::: & skill sets that will help students::: not leave them unemployable with student loan debt.,So many trolls here. No one is condoning any rioting or violence::: but the comparisons are ridiculous. BLM was trying to be heard and protested to gain a voice and an equal chance in life. Yesterday's thugs were a bunch of crybabies storming our Capitol because they didn't get what they want!,Well said::: Dr. Sands and yes::: it is time for all leaders to speak up just as over 170 business leaders have done in the past week.,One only need read through the comments on this post to see how much work has to be done. Supposedly educated folks::: I‚Äôm ashamed some of you call yourselves Hokies.,Well said Jeanne...I must have missed the previous ones as well.,People also died during BLM protests and the burning of small private businesses .... where was a statement then?,Was there sadness over months of Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone raging violence? I must have missed that post.,Thank you Mr President. I will go back and read your remarks regarding last summer‚Äôs violent events::: as well. Where might I find them?,Tim Sands::: please share your statements from the past concerning the BLM and Antifa riots::: arson::: destruction of public property::: violence::: and the long list of acts you currently condemn. If there are none::: this one is pure BS politics.,These comments actually make me fearful to send my child back to Blacksburg in a week:::,Well you need to get them off to a better start in elementary schools. And not just in Virginia but in all places. There should be a university infusion to the first rung of the ladder where the learning process begins.,Stay out of politics VT. Sands you were not there,I am a parent of an Alumni and I can say warmly that after a crisis I look for Dr. Sands' messages for comfort. Once again::: I am very thankful.,Did you post a message condemning Maxine Waters when she demanded the public assault cabinet members? I smell a hypocrite.,"It is kinda funny scrolling FB and the pearl clutching statements from our political ""leaders"" when none could be bothered as the PEOPLE's neighborhoods and businesses were burned to the ground::: shuttered and closed down. Glad DC is the getting the brunt of something FOR ONCE!",What would the consequences have been had you not posted this?,FYI Steve Bannon was a Hokie. (I used past tense because I do not want to own that!),Maybe y‚Äôall should focus on having a winning football season,So let me get this straight ..... VT wants to provide resources for people and promoted change to happen when Cities across the country were being actually destroyed for weeks on end but people on the other side finally question things and a statement needs to be made regarding this? I truly don‚Äôt understand the difference in how situations in this country are handled ..,Rah rah. Condemn violence::: racism::: employment inequalities. I bet you someone can write a computer program to spit this stuff out.,There's so many narratives coming out about this. Was anyone at the event in DC? If so::: did you take any photos to support your opinions of how things went?,Well stated!!,Well said! Ignore the ignorant haters in the comments. üôÇ,What about blm and Antifa the past year?,You don‚Äôt need to have an opinion.....,Ahh mr sands üòÇüòÇüòÇ I guess you had to get nikki Giovanni to help you write thisüòÇüòÇüòÇ. Didn‚Äôt she condone violence hoping trump would burn in a plane? You Ban Steve bannon beliefs but praise hers? Isn‚Äôt she the one that could have done a better job with trying to get cho help instead of shutting the door on him? Lol hypocrites gonna be hypocrites.,Where was the denunciation of hate and violence this summer? Tech will never see a dollar of my alumni money until this idiot is removed.,Tim Sands you‚Äôre a turd,I see you are taking notes from Whit Babcocks recent release. At least you knew you didn‚Äôt have to print this off and take a picture of it to post.,Yes::: very nice. What skin does VT have in the game?,John Champeau I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôve seen this. Great statement from President Sands.,Excellent statement Dr. Sands,Jeanne Hull Olszowy did you know you would open that can of worms today. LOL,Natalie Pasquel,Lock up Trump!,Thank you:::President Sands::: well said.,Marit Domjahn,Snowflake Sands ...,OUR REPUBLIC IS GONE I hope and pray JESUS returns before a full blown civil war breaks out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 1953::: Virginia Tech accepted one Black student. In 2020::: Virginia Tech welcomed 571 Black students.  Tune in to VT Unfinished: A conversation with Virginia Tech's first African American Student today at noon to hear from Irving Linwood Peddrew III.  As the first Black student admitted to Virginia Tech::: Peddrew will recount his journey and experience at the university.  VTNEWS.VT.EDU Irving Peddrew discusses his experience as Virginia Tech's first Black student,2020-12-09 15:22:30,I‚Äôm not sure why people on this thread seem to think VT is satisfied with the current enrollment number of 571 Black students. It is an indicator of progress::: not goal attainment. VT has placed an emphasis::: as it should::: on increasing minority enrollment and continues to do so.,Out of 6000 incoming students less than 10 recent were Black. This is not good enough. I am a proud Hokie but you need to do better.,Unfortunately most white people don't notice it when their environment is filled with all white people - they are mostly clueless - and too many probably prefer too keep it that way - an unfortunate fact of living in America!,I think it‚Äôd simply be better if names and race and gender were removed during the application process. If it doesn‚Äôt matter::: remove it from anything on the application.,Most of you have an extremely limited understanding of what admissions is about and what goes on. Lol.,It's a state school::: apply with grades and tuition get in.,Most of these comments are cringe. No nuance at all. Completely throwing merit::: academic preparedness::: and application numbers out the window. I think 571 is a fine number and it will likely increase naturally over time to match the population proportions (let‚Äôs not forget that we are 12 percent of the population) without ham-fisted interventions in the admissions process.,I wonder what the number of white applicants is to the number of black applicants.,So it took 67 years for Virginia Tech to go from accepting 1 black student to accepting 571 black students?  I just can‚Äôt draw a straight line to how I‚Äôm supposed to be impressed with that number....,When we no longer are able nor care to notice or count students of any particular race or ethnicity we will have made true progress. Numbers shouldn't matter. Only opportunity.,I was at the 2016 graduation when he received his honorary degree - he is an inspiration (and yes the work isn‚Äôt done but we have come a long way since he was a student at VT - my African American son is proof of that),"I understand this article is intended to display VT's willingness to participate in the national discussion of race relations in the US::: which is desperately needed. But if highlighting the number of blacks ""welcomed"" now was intended to show VT's committment to diversity::: it has the opposite effect. 8% is a sad commentary. How many black students applied that were academically qualified and what % of them were accepted? If applications from minorities are minimal::: what is your plan to facilitate promotion of VT's committment to diversity?",Crazy to think that many of our parents were alive and living in the United States when literally most colleges and universities would reject aspiring young students simply because of the color of their skin....,Where a person chooses to attend college is just that a personal choice. School choice has many deciding factors such as degree paths offered::: cost::: living arrangements::: preferences for climate::: distance from home/family::: just to name a few. I do agree that a good majority of schools across the country need to pay attention to their student populations needs and in how they recruit if needed. My daughter had her heart set on NC State::: until she saw the cost. She loves VT and the program she is in.,"For those that like to throw numbers around (and I'm a VT engineering alumnus)::: what would be a ""good"" number? Why is 571 ""not good enough""? Is it supposed to equal the state's ratio? Is it supposed to equal the nation's ratio? Is it supposed to equal the local ratio? Do you know how many blacks applied? How many were denied? Do you know how many total students applied? How many were denied?  Kinda hard to draw a conclusion on a single data point. What if a large % were internationals? Indians? Chinese? Would you say that's diverse? What if it's a significant increase from previous years even relative to the number of applicants? Would that suffice? What if the number of black applicants were low but the % admitted was higher? Would that be good enough?  So before yall just start throwing shade on a pretty kickass university's page::: do us all alumni a favor and stop making us look like idiots. Stop trying to draw conclusions on a lab you slept through because you partied too hard from a Thursday night game üòÅ",That‚Äôs still a very low acceptance rate for blacks.,I'm a little disappointed by alot of these comments from fellow Hokies. While 571 may not be high enough in your mind::: you have to remember there is still an admissions process. First off::: you can't force people to apply to VT. How many black people actually applied? I have a feeling 571 is a high percentage of actuals who applied. Secondly::: you still have to meet the school requirements for admission::: GPA::: SAT::: and overall resume from high school. Thirdly::: VT is not for everyone. It's not in:::a city setting and maybe that will turn people away. Personally::: I think VT has one of the best campuses in the nation. So while 571 is good::: I'm sure it will keep getting better.,I would hope many more than 571 were accepted::: maybe they chose to go elsewhere? Seems like a low number for a 6000-7000 entering freshmen class.,Why is skin color mentioned? Is VT discriminating based on race? Aren't we all Americans and earn acceptance to VT by merit? BTW::: How many Chinese Communists are enrolled and paid for by the Communist Chinese government? That is a more important issue.,This is like when I was an orientation leader and had to discuss diversity on campus with incoming freshman. As a minority::: VT is nowhere near diverse. To those who‚Äôve never truly experienced or appreciated diversity::: it seems adequate. This number is shockingly low to me given the overall numbers of students. Definitely an area VT needs to improve upon. Much to celebrate with Irving Peddrew so long as we know the work isn‚Äôt done.,How about instead of focusing on diversity for the sake of diversity::: we remove all identifying features from college applications and admit only the most most qualified. That means no race::: sex::: names::: addresses::: or names of schools attended. Just your GPA::: extracurricular s::: essay (if needed)::: and desired degree path. Can't be more fair than that.,I think it would be a better comparison to how many applied and admitted vs. how many are welcomed??,I read and re-read that 2020 number just to make sure I read correctly - 571 total welcomed in 2020? We are Virginia Tech! We can and should do better!,I mean I'm sure thousands of blacks are not applying to VT. They have their HBCUs,Yeah. 571 is not equitable.,You all have nothing better to do but complain about Tech's Diversity standards. PEOPLE HAVE TO APPLY!!!!,Wow. My incoming class in fall 1994 had over 700. Why is it getting smaller?üòØ,Should be 30-35% enrollment for people of color,Now check numbers on how many Indian- and Asian- American people were accepted. Walk around VT for a few minutes and you‚Äôll see how diverse it is. 10% African American is pretty solid considering the other race‚Äôs percentages.,üëèüèΩüëèüèΩüëèüèΩ,Why is this feeling more disappointing than a thing to be proud of üôÅ 531??,Thank you for sharing this interview. I really enjoyed listening to it and hearing from him about his experience. Just as a note::: my grandfather::: Dr. Paul Farrier::: was the Director of Admissions at that time. My grandfather was one of the men who went to see Mr. Peddrew and I believe was the one who spoke to him about that since his experience had gone well that it opened up the door for the next three African-America n students to be enrolled.,Not a very good representation.,571 is not an achievement,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous mask efficacy studies have focused on masks used by healthcare workers::: like N95 respirators::: but what about the cloth face coverings that many are purchasing and making at home?  Virginia Tech expert in airborne disease transmission::: Linsey Marr::: and her Virginia Tech Civil & Environmental Engineering team set out to answer this question through a new study examining the efficacy of common face coverings.  Marr and her team tested nine different homemade masks for their ability to trap particles to help protect both mask wearers and those nearby::: with a focus on particle sizes common to breathing and speaking. ‚¨áÔ∏è  VTNEWS.VT.EDU Study shows cloth face coverings help protect both wearers and those nearby,2020-11-23 17:51:00,The constitution is not suspended in times of emergency. I am VT alum an if you want to wear a mask fine. It's not the government place to tell us. If you prefer temporary safety over freedom::: then you deserve neither.,‚Äú...I THINK (emphasis mine) homemade masks are definitely helpful.‚Äù Wow. That‚Äôs real science.,The longer the masks wearing is done overall::: the longer the virus will remain with us. A normal unaltered virus is seasonal.. it runs it course and fades away. We see a new virus every spring. This particular one was created::: and the next one::: according to Fauci and Gates will be deadlier. So keep the masks on::: keep the immune system weak and the next go around more deaths will occure. ADGENDA 31,Wish the article summed up its findings with a ranking of best to worst for quick reference.,Masks don‚Äôt work. Like this study shows::: only large particles are stopped by masks::: which accounts for less than 5% of the particles one expels when one coughs::: laughs::: speaks::: sneezes::: etc. Its a joke::: right? Virologists suit up from head to toe to work with viruses. You ain‚Äôt stopping nothing::: especially covid aerosols::: with a cotton mask. Not even a surgical mask. It says so on the side of the box. How are we still here? Inform yourself. Those protect the physician from inhaling splatter in an operating room::: and are frequently changed. The latest peer reviewed Danish study showed that not even N95 makes show any significant protection be non masking. Expect better from you Virginia Tech!!,What is far better than a mask is a healthy immune system. But that doesn't fit the agenda so it is never recommended.,I agree with this now! I own n95 masks::: but in early October I was exposed to COVID from a coworker. This person was literally side by side with me on different occasions the day I was exposed. She had on a surgical mask::: I had on a cloth one::: my test came back negative! I was petrified at first!,"‚ÄúIt‚Äôs true that some of the cloth masks that we looked at only block 10 or 20 percent at that size. "" Encouraging title a little misleading ü§î",Would loved to have seen the three people standing in front of some Hokie Stone instead of a generic parking lot and shrubs. Also::: stopped reading half way through because there were no tables and graphs plots. This is VT. Every single human on the planet is bored::: fearful::: and fed up with the masking madness.,Rabeea FarhanHabeel Ahmed,If masked worked why is covid spiking ? Especially in cities with the strictest policies ?,Matthew Miller if it has a heifer silhouette it‚Äôs even more effective.,Connor Williams,Listen to science::: scream the folks who think there are more than 2 genders.,Amy Bright Palmer - another confirmation for your grad work...,Corey Baker,No one::: even this article has said mask were 100% effective. Wearing seatbelts is not 100% effective either but we do it.,I hope she is a better leader than Justin Fuente. #PayTheBuyout!!!,"Scientific experts >>>>> random dudes who googled ""why don't masks work"" for their opinions.",Came here for the people who like to denounce science::: was not disappointed,How about the Denmark study?,There are many of these tests that show there‚Äôs absolutely no benefit so it‚Äôs just all noise at this point.,POPPYCOCK.,Pretty sure there was a new peer reviewed Danish study that just came out which states masks are ineffective. Why publish this study::: that in no way takes into account how people actually use masks?,It would be interesting to see a study done on masks that are reused multiple times::: not washed frequently::: or just used way beyond their lifespan. I‚Äôm sure there are lots of people doing this with no thought. Wearing a dirty mask all day has to have some increase in the risk of getting a respiratory illness.,I wear a mask - overall both studies cited this one and the Denmark study state the N95 is best - the others are helpful but not preventive. That‚Äôs my summation- any mask is better than no mask,I think there is a lot of evidence to show that masks block respiratory droplets. But it doesn't seem to translate to actual prevention of illness: https:// theconversation. com/ face-masks-cut-d isease-spread-i n-the-lab-but-h ave-less-impact -in-the-communi ty-we-need-to-k now-why-147912,Why doesn't VT do studies on how to win football games?,Neil Orr study... masks are ineffective. And many other historical data/studies show the same result.,I love how all the people w no medical credentials always find it their place to dispute people with years of medical background and competence. Sitting behind a phone and typing a few words doesn‚Äôt make someone‚Äôs opinion of masks ‚Äúnot working‚Äù very convincing. Lol just like we would trust a surgeon to operate and offer advice on us rather than us saying no it ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt work.‚Äù Smdh.,A vaccine is right around the corner. Can't you wear a mask for a short period of time until then?,But it still helps? Over none? I wash my 3layer cloth masks daily.,Beth Davis,So did you see it stop a virus?thats what we are talking about::: right...so did it stop a virus? AMDG,I was not able to verify that this was a valid website. Why is that?,Lindsey and her team do good work! Non-maskers will find fault with everything!!,Interesting study. Testing under ideal controlled circumstances is useful knowledge::: however::: it leaves out a whole lot of human behavior and mask design/ fit issues. I work in a museum that has been open to the public since July and we have not had::: thank goodness::: a traceable outbreak related to our venue. We are not using all of our facilities::: mostly outside portion::: but we do have some head count control attendance for a large indoor exhibit area where social distancing is possible. When it comes to mask wearing....I've seen it all and believe me there's not a lot of 'ideal controlled circumstances' going on anywhere. If the constant handling and adjusting I've seen is any indication then masks are virtually worthless due to human behavior::: poor fit::: and sloppy wearing. I'm not talking about anyone being defiant or rude::: just people in general touch::: move::: remove::: and replace the masks every couple of minutes. People take them off::: wave them around::: dangle them around their wrists::: stuff them in their pockets::: then pull them back out::: put them on and start the entire cycle all over again. It's both hilarious and frightening. Please don't think that just because you see someone wearing a mask that they aren't still able to pass the virus.,Use common sense. Any mask is better than no mask. Just wear one for the greater common good. If you don‚Äôt have risk factors try to think of the others you come in contact with that might. It‚Äôs not about your freedom it‚Äôs about trying to mitigate the risk for everyone.,For the one who asked me what percentage do I think masks work (your comment was deleted for some reason and I don't remember your name) here is my answer: From what I have seen::: N95 masks are 95% effective::: surgical masks are 60% effective::: this medical journal article places face coverings at 65%. I would even take 10% if it meant a chance to protect my father and my family and those I love. I do research science and medical articles concerning the effectiveness. Of course they need to be combined with hand washing/ Sanitizing::: distancing (which can be impossible when anti-maskers don't think they have to distance::: wash their hands::: clean cart handles::: etc. in stores. https:// www.thelancet.co m/journals/ lancet/article/ PIIS0140-6736(20 )31142-9/ fulltext,I want to know how many people actually sneeze in a mask that they have to wear all day? I might clear my throat in my mask::: but if I have to sneeze my mask comes down and I get a tissue to sneeze. Seems extremely gross to sneeze in a mask.,Late to the game but It's a nice study and a very good effort but as the author stated::: it's a lab study. There are::: as she stated a lot of variables when studying mask and face-covering efficacy and there are tons of similar studies with very similar results. For example::: little to no discussion on Brownians motion::: tidal volume::: hygiene of the mask::: facial sizes and facial hair all play a major role etc.  Other studies with similar results BMJ::: Stanford::: Duke::: University of Cambridge::: University of Colorado.,I‚Äôm gonna bet half the dimwits commenting anti-mask::: anti-science nonsense didn‚Äôt even go to VT. Bye üëãüèº,Told y‚Äôa!,All these scientific studies and yet people still don‚Äôt believe it lol.,I can't believe this is being debated. This is beyond sad.,Good thing science doesn't discriminate::: you could be in trouble.,Leo KimSarah Yoon the amount of smooth brain people in the comments ü§©ü§©,Wow-\-\I see that 28 people so far have chosen to embrace their ignorance instead of protecting others.

‚ÄúWe won‚Äôt see a decline in cases with college students leaving [for the holidays] unless our community makes a change in behavior. Our rising case numbers are coming from our community spread.‚Äù  Noelle Bissell::: health director of the New River Health District::: shared that college students are not the primary spreaders of the coronavirus ‚Äî it‚Äôs the larger NRV community that is responsible for the latest uptick in positive COVID-19 cases.  We need our community to do their part to cut back on the spread by washing their hands::: wearing facial coverings::: and physical distancing.  VTNEWS.VT.EDU Community spread::: not students::: reason for rise of COVID-19 in New River Valley,2020-11-19 12:07:00,Maybe Virginia tech should have focused on making face masks for their own community before worrying about Hong Kong protestors.,I‚Äôm so glad I got to play beer bong and not worry about this stuff when I was there.,No matter what you say or what you do you will not stop the spread. It‚Äôs gonna run it‚Äôs course.,I did notice how many students have masks when heading downtown and I really appreciate that as we live here all the time. I thank them for stepping up and doing better.,Holy crap. The Blacksburg/ NRV community are the most covid-compiant people I've ever been around. They do all the all things to a borderline-paranoid level. You *cannot* find anyone downtown without a mask. Businesses have closed forever. Most others are on the brink of death from covid compliance. There's nothing more the community can give.  If the school is demanding more::: thats not going to to happen. You will not find a community takes covid more seriously than Blacksburg folks.  This is a disgraceful post::: and Tech should be ashamed of themselves for throwing an entire community under the bus that has sacrificed a massive amount at the altar of covid. Stop demanding more from people who have given you everything.,Jack Tyson,I really hope students are taking precautions to protect their loved ones as they return for the break. Even if the spread here weren't related to the university's decisions::: I think we have reason to care about spread to other communities with the pivot. I also hope all the students and staff who did contract covid19 with the student return::: over 1600 people tested positive on campus now::: have smooth recoveries. We know long covid exists and can pop up months later::: so we shouldn't think non-contagious = recovered. We should still be looking to care for and support one another. I also think it's really notable that Dr. Bissell is talking about carpooling as a cause of spread: I would love to see VT and other larger employers take action to permit folks to park for free on a temporary basis to encourage less need for carpooling (and to do remote work whenever possible so that cars and public transport don't have to be part of the equation if they don't have to be).,Maybe it‚Äôs that all the precautions we take can‚Äôt stop a virus that is hell bent on infecting anything it can... this virus is resilient and determined::: that‚Äôs its purpose::: as a living organism::: to infect all of us. No matter how hard we try we will not stop this virus... we should be thankful the death rate is only 1.6% and not 6% to 10%... let‚Äôs live our life::: as best we can and stop blaming everyone for something that can‚Äôt be stopped. Students fault.. communities fault... anti-maskers fault... chinas fault... how about the virus‚Äô fault .. and there‚Äôs no stopping it. How about we stop blaming each other::: start living in the world we have::: stop destroying our economy and way of life and start helping those that can be helped and pray for those we can‚Äôt. Life goes on.,That's because they already brought it here. Thanks for nothing #VTgreed...,‚ÄúWe‚Äôre superior to the local populace in every way. There‚Äôs no possible way Virginia Tech was responsible for the spread. Please support our sports teams and pay over priced tuition for online learning we sold you on as in person. Thanks‚Äù - Tim Sands probably,This is a lie. Covid cases were almost non-existent here until the students came to town. Not surprising from someone with as little integrity as Sands.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Oh wait::: y'all love y'all some Putin and Xi like the Gropenfuhrer himself. And if you can't understand or are unwilling to understand the history and situation in Hong Kong...I got nothin' for ya.,Will help them stay around longer to be able to steal more TV‚Äôs and liquor,Here Are the 100 U.S. Cities Where Protesters Were Tear-Gassed: https:// www.nytimes.com/ interactive/ 2020/06/16/us/ george-floyd-pro tests-police-te ar-gas.html,Disappointed::: VT should keep itself away from these political events::: especially when many of the protestors are not peaceful and holding weapon against the government.

Remember Latfyette Square?,Where can I get one?,"A Hokie's motto is UT prosim::: which means that I may serve. Thank you hokies for your ingenuity and design. Also we stand for ""invent the future.""

Well done to these great Hokie minds!,yeah::: in Hong Kong.,Congratulations to the student team who thought of this invention and the faculty who supported it design it to perfection so as to win such a prestigious award. I am sure that such a handy device will not only find use against misuse of tear gas but also as a personal protective equipment against smoke from small wildfires or against air pollution. I would like to know more about how it works and how it could be further modified to meet diverse needs.,agree with other comments::: this is great for peaceful protesters::: as seen in other socialist/ communist countries but not in countries like ours when used on violent and unrulily protest groups. Its very terrible that evil people are using peaceful protests as a cover for violence::: luting and destruction!,Va tech should be ashamed of this... not proud! Our tax $ should not be used to help rioters and looters get an upper hand on the police. This is a pathetic showing of the liberal biased in our state support universities. I have embarrassed of Virginia tech and it‚Äôs students and policies!,You mean for ‚Äúpeaceful RIOTS‚Äù across our country. Riots by definition are NOT peaceful and are ILEGAL!!,How are they against bean bag cannons and rubber bullets?,Who else used to be proud of VT for staying out of politics and the public eye?,I'll take 100.,No comment. I mean so you assist people to not be affected by tear gas. Hope your conscious doesn't bother you once people get hurt::: injured or killed. But hey what do i know. Enjoy your award,READ THE NEWS!!! They threw bricks at the Hong Kong people and their property. They lit an old man on fire. They stabbed a policewoman with the tip of umbrella. They blocked down the road::: pulled down and beat up a driver just to vent. And now they are attempting to run away to avoid law sanction. No matter what kind of hypocritical term they identify themselves::: these are aggregated assault::: arson::: unlawful assembly::: and absconding which are known as CRIME.,Interesting. I would love to see a demo. The images don't look like the mask would be effective. CS is a powder made aerosol using solvents::: but it should pass easily through the open media by the left cheek (unless there is a filter that goes there::: but isn't there for some reason). I wonder whether it also is effective against pepper spray.  To clarify::: if it is effective it could be the basis of new NBC gear for our military which is lighter in weight and has better field of view.  Regardless::: the Chinese will certainly just step up to a more dangerous deterrent like rubber bullets or water cannons.,So although I commend their innovation... you must recognize the risks as well. If you protect protesters from tear gas::: you are forcing the use of more lethal means. Not sure all aspects were considered prior to development. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§î,This is good for people in Hong Kong for protesting for democracy peacefully. But I don‚Äôt think people in the U.S should be able to buy this just to go out and harass our police and loot and destroy for no reason. Because ‚Äúorange man bad‚Äù. üôÑ,Bunch of friggin geniuses on this post.... üôÑ,If tear gas (or OC or CS spray in the US) is no longer effective against rioters::: something else more forceful will be deployed. Nobody wins in this arms race.,Will this product be available to peaceful protesters only? If so::: how to enforce?,Don't send them all abroad. Unfortunately::: we needed them this year at Freedom Plaza right across from the White House!,Awesome VT. Happy to help the pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. Yet how long will it take Antifa and the mindless rioters and looters that are tearing down the great US of A to get their very own set?,However..not to be used by criminal Rioters in our country . Right?,Maybe come up with rubber bullet protective vests that would be a good one. Then they will use the real thing. Protesting for democracy is great but they will use much more dangerous tactics dealing with the Communist party,Just for Hong Kong::: right?,Unintended result: Red Army stops using nonlethal means,Hokies doing what they do:::helping the world,It would be nice if the screen could protect against rubber bullets as well.,I think people need to read the law. Riots are against the law. Gatherings of 3 or more people in the state of VA.::: without a permit is against the law.,Way to go! Tear gas is illegal to use in war per the Geneva Protocol of 1925 and is defined as a chemical warfare agent but we still see governments using this against their own citizens,....yeah-demons trators wear this..so tear gas doesn‚Äôt serve to disperse. A false sense of security will get you killed in many countries.,These students were little kids at one point who dreamed of accomplishing something in their future. They are finally here inventing something that most of us could only dream of being smart enough to create. Obviously no negative intentions were a part of the project that these students created. In the end::: these students put their education to use and DID SOMETHING. So::: from another student::: I am proud of everyone involved in this. It feels good to put our education to use for something actually applicable. For those who are shaming the students and the university for mentioning that these masks will help the protestors in Hong Kong::: please take a second and consider the fact that you are not omniscient. You don't know all sides of a story or what will happen in the future. Be happy that we have students in this country who are willing to stand up for their beliefs and are smart enough to do something about them.,Great job on the part of the students. Tear Gas or ‚ÄúCS‚Äù gas is an irritant::: and it should only be used by law enforcement when there is civil unrest::: and a peaceful and lawful assembly/ protest turns into an unlawful assembly or riots (to include violence and property damage) and after multiple orders of disperse/cease/ desist/ or leave the area are ignored. If protestors insist on ignoring the lawful orders from law enforcement::: and take it beyond ‚Äúcivil disobedience‚Äù::: Tear Gas will be an option. No one wants this to be a last resort more than law enforcement. When tear gas has to be used::: it‚Äôs because things have gotten to a dangerous level of unlawful assembly.,Redesign for a Covid mask as well!,Reading comprehension doesn‚Äôt seem to be a strong trait among this group of commentators. The inspiration for this were the protests in Hong Kong for those fighting for democracy and the use of tear gas on non violent protesters.,This is incredible given the current state of global affairs. Excellent innovation!,help us bring them in Africa particularly in Uganda cos we urgently need them since we are at verge of overthrowing a dictator come 2021,Congratulations ! Please find a way to bring this to market! It would have be very welcome during the recent spate of protests.,My daughter is part of this project and I am extremely proud of her and grateful to her VT professors who encouraged her group. I should add that it is disheartening to read unsupportive comments about your child and her classmates on their school‚Äôs page.,It will go down the list of ban items of import in many countries.,you could use that even on a work site with alot of particles in the air,Time to redesign the gas lol,Now I look at this post.,Love to see innovation.,Seriously VT? Intentionally robbing and destroying public and private properties and hurting innocent citizens are all considered proper pro-democracy protest and is the right thing to do? Good lecture VT::: please sell me one of those and count me in. Oh::: don‚Äôt forget to send one to all the rioters in the U.S. They‚Äôre just fight for equal rights yeah?  One other thing::: you‚Äôre saying they‚Äôre misusing tear gas? What would you suggest they should do? Or should cops just let rioters do their thing?  For first time in my life I feel really embarrassed that I attended a college like this.,Joe Quinlan ...the comments here ruin how amazing this is,While I think this is a great thing and I commend the students for their innovation and achievement::: I find it funny that VT mentions protestors in another country while failing to mention the relevance of this device here lol. Let's not forget the use of tear gas on our own soil::: ESPECIALLY the time it was used in front of the White House. That being said::: great for VT for supporting our rights to protest!,Cheers for the design award. Wouldn‚Äôt expect anything less from VT students. However::: tear gas is only used when necessary. Students should be learning or possibly involved in peaceful protests and not in the streets at 2AM destroying property and looting small businesses where tear gas is sometimes used to address lawlessness.,Hummm hey VT not all protesters are peaceful. Btw there are also things called unintended consequences. If tear gas or other things like smoke does not breakup the violence then peace makers (ie the police::: other armed forces or whatever politically correct term you want to use) will be forced to use more dramatic and hurtful means to restore peace. Seems like this is a bad idea unless you like more destruction and people imposing there ‚Äòjustice‚Äô on others without a neutral jury. Tear gas and smoke is mainly used to just break up packs of Destructive people. Poor ‚Äúinnovation‚Äù VT and not something to brag about.,Great. Now VT's backing and supporting protesters. #VTgreed,You know what else protects you from tear gas? Not acting like a pansy protesting and rioting.,"man::: how terrible that hong kong police are using tear gas on nonviolent protesters. what a relief that that is definitely only happening ""halfway around the world"" as you say. i'm so thankful we don't have that problem::: like::: 3 hours down the road in richmond. could you imagine??? what a nightmare that would be!! such a good thing that that is DEFINITELY NOT happening in our own backyards. phew.",All societies will have times of civil unrest and for good reason. Government::: even ours::: overstep bounds or civil rights are being denied or just don't exist::: and people are supposed to sit back and be at peace? I think not. People who think that protesting and rioting in times where change is needed is wrong are okay with the establishment and how things are because it doesn't hurt THEM or it benefits THEM. Be grateful that some of you have NEVER had to protest for basic rights and equal treatment. You don't know how it feels::: so kindly sit back and shut your privileged mouths.,When we see Antifa wearing these we‚Äôll know where they came from,‚Äúin hong kong‚Äù,if you were not being a lowlife protestor you shouldn't need a mask like this,Umm Trump used tear gas at the church so we are clear.,WOW!,Ian Annis this is amazing!

"‚ÄúThis was not a fun endeavor::: trying to put together a spring plan realizing we needed to back away from spring break. If we only took Fridays off::: we would disproportionately hit those courses that are held on Fridays."" ‚ÄîUniversity Registrar::: Rick Sparks  Read the full recap of our spring semester virtual town hall::: where academic leaders discussed the spring break decision::: ensuring students will get a real break on the well-being days::: and more. ‚¨áÔ∏è  VTNEWS.VT.EDU Health and safety considerations guided spring decisions::: say Virginia Tech leaders",2020-10-26 17:50:04,Also see this message from Provost Cyril Clarke::: reminding faculty of the importance of preserving the one-day spring break holidays and to do their best to avoid assignment due dates and exams on days immediately following these well-being breaks. https:// www.provost.vt.e du/ provost-message- spring-break-20 21.html,Alternate the day of the week they have off so everyone will have a break,I read the students feedback on the petition and it does not help them mentally to give them piece meal days. So sad you cannot find a resolution. But the good news for them bc of the system of zoom you have created::: they can zoom from anywhere. So I am sure most of these young folks are smart enough to preserve themselves and their mental health. I recently had a conversation with a VT employee in the Deans office and she told me professors can do what they want she told me mam that is academic freedom. I took note.,I watched the whole time and came away a little more encouraged. Unfortunately::: it didn't last long as far as spring class modality. WAY TOO MANY online only courses again. Not pleased. VT needs to do better with providing options for in person classes for the students who want them.,There is a simple solution: a Thursday/ Friday break::: a Monday/Tuesday break and a Friday break. There will be one fewer Friday and one bonus Wednesday::: but there are very rarely Friday only classes::: and you could easily treat that one Wednesday like a Friday if it's an issue. Two four day weekends and a three day weekend. Not enough time to go on a big spring break trip. Plenty of time to mentally unwind.,Virginia Tech is led by fear porn propagandists::: not common sense leaders. It‚Äôs a tragedy.,Why not just make the semester a week shorter?,Have in person classes so kids won‚Äôt leave campus.,Please remember that students in some majors are already under tremendous pressure just to keep up with their curriculum::: assignments:::pro jects:::tests::: internship requirements etc. Add to that the changes in methods of study including having to figure out doing labs online and numerous other things they are having to figure out on their own. Believe me::: they are trying their best and putting in every effort to make their goals and are grateful to be on campus. It is very hard and takes a toll on their mental health. It is of utmost importance to give them adequate breaks just to recover and reconnect. That will be key to the overall success of the system and my sincere hope is that the administration and professors will pay due attention to this.,There‚Äôs been a spike in suicide ideation that you played down - I worry for the students who listened to how well Hokies are doing::: and know that they aren‚Äôt doing well::: and the impact that their incorrect perceptions that everyone else is dealing well may have had on them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Is there any way to get clarification on how Virginia Tech is planning to make sure that planned one-day breaks are actually break days and conducive to mental health? What I got from the town hall was that ""It's going to work because these days will be days you don't have to work."" I'm not sure how that applies to students who have projects and assignments which are generally scheduled in weekly::: rather than daily::: blocks. As a student::: you can't just ""take a day off:::"" because you will fall behind on assignments. It's not the same as being able to take a day off from work::: where you typically have members of a team which can cover for you. As a student::: you get an individual grade for individual performance::: and if you're on a team::: then the whole team falls behind if everyone ""takes a day off.""

Submit your questions here: bit.ly/ vtspringquestion s,Thanks VT for finding creative ways that would allow our kids back in classes. MUCH APPRECIATED!,I understand this decision but it‚Äôs still disappointing as a current student. It‚Äôs hard to justify paying out of state tuition for all or mostly online courses. The online classroom is subpar at best::: and as someone who hasn‚Äôt had much experience with online classes::: I‚Äôm not doing well. If we‚Äôre doing mostly online courses::: there should be the credit/ no-credit option that was presented to us last semester.,Can VT stop with the pre recorded classes. At least make the virtual classes live for the tuition we are paying.,All these people saying it‚Äôs great must not be students... with classes online::: us students see no reason to stay on campus and travel all the time. We can just as easily take our classes on vacation as we can on campus. All this for a virus no worse than the flu::: which hasn‚Äôt hospitalized a single vt student.,Um what about out of state students who can‚Äôt go home for the weekend? Or students who work and can‚Äôt take the day off?,It‚Äôs too risky for our kids to go home for a much needed mental health break yet the hotels in Blacksburg have been sold out throughout this semester full of the out of state athletic teams & their families. And::: our athletes are all traveling out of state to compete as well. ü§î,Virginia Tech for those of us in the community that own lodging businesses::: will you be allowing or doing some campus visits this spring for prospective students? February and April are usually good months for us. We need visitors in some capacity or more businesses will be closing their doors.,VT is not the first college to do this. They are following several others who have been announcing this change for the last 2 weeks.,This will lead to an increase in stress and mental illness. VT needs to remember all of the incidents that happened on campus due to mental illness. My Freshman year::: another freshman jumped off of the parking garage trying to kill himself because of the stress.,By taking away our time to see family and friends::: this will increase rates of mental illness and stress::: which in return::: makes people more susceptible to the virus. You seem to only care about the virus and not the students overall well being. We‚Äôre all adults here and should be treated as so to make the appropriate decisions and to act smart. Is this or is this not preparing us for the real world?,The spring break decision sucks for multiple reasons- professors will take advantage of them only being one day and will give assignments that will Have to be worked on during that day because of when/how they handed them out. And then what about working students? I already work 5 days a week- I look forward to breaks so that I can have some time to catch up during the semester. By doing this I won‚Äôt be able to take time off of work to catch up the way I normally would.,PLEASE let them go back to class and have events for the students (socially distanced of course)-\-\this is terrible for the students!!!!!!!,Professors will still assign homework over fall break::: what makes Tech think they're not gonna do that in the spring?,I assume this will mean no Ring Dance? üò•,Please do not cancel another graduation::: please come up with some kind of solution to at least let us graduate in Lane::: we can all wear masks and be 6 feet apartüò≠üò≠,The one day break won‚Äôt really be a break because there will be assignments and assessments that week and this will turn into a study day. Would have been better to at least have attached the days to weekends to give a couple of days in a row.,Thank your democrat president and the out of control Gov.,My son and his girlfriend didn‚Äôt have a fall break because they had professors that had assignments due::: zoom meetings and quizzes due by midnight. The majority of your professors do not abide by single day breaks. My son::: a ME senior::: has NEVER had fall break...not once. I understand the need to mitigate excessive travel and breaking CDC guidelines::: but this is NOT a healthy alternative if you are seriously concerned about the social and emotional well-being of your students. I am an educator...stud ents need more than one consecutive day off to truly decompress. This news has created so much additional stress for our students as they continue with midterms.,college students have a really difficult few years and we are all hoping you get the college experience you have worked so hard for.,Yeah this is a terrible idea. As a VT alum::: I'm disappointed in the way this school has handled this pandemic. Seems the focus is too much on money and not enough on the students' wellbeing.,I fully expected something like this. I do hope the announcement for being hybrid vs. all online gives us enough time to decide if we want to pay that kind of price again. My daughters all changed the day prior to class so we were stuck.,Will the Administrative::: Research and Academic buildings remain open during this time to accept deliveries (UPS::: FedEx::: Mail etc.) and to properly maintain the buildings?,Those random 5 days are ridiculous! Should be added to weekends to give students more time or end semester early. Disappointed this was announced without input from students.,Seriously::: random Tuesday off... I can just imagine MWF profs saying ‚Äúthis is a normal week with a normal amount of work that I‚Äôm still expecting you to do on time.‚Äù  Breaks in the middle of the week don‚Äôt help students relax::: 3 day weekends do. Make all of them Monday or Friday.,Virginia Tech If you are concerned with input and questions on these decisions::: please have a survey open for more than 24 hours. As a hard-working engineering student who has had 3 tests already on Saturdays this term and didn't even realize there was a Fall break::: I have some major concerns for the mental health of myself and peers. I just learned about this today and went to the survey to post my concerns and it was already closed.,As if the seniors couldn‚Äôt get screwed out of anything else::: there goes our final spring break! Convinced that our school doesn‚Äôt receive any input from students when making decisions like this,We pray for in person classes and in person graduation.,If graduation is not in person and I don‚Äôt even get a real spring break::: I‚Äôm gonna be so upset. This is crap.,And when you think VT's decisions couldn't get any worse. Just so disappointed in VT....again. Just end the semester a week early if you must continue to placate the masses.,All this for a virus that hasn‚Äôt even hospitalized a single student,Setting the days off in the middle of the week will not discourage professors from expecting students to do work over those days off. The students (and probably staff for that matter) count on spring break as a mental break from their studies for 7 full days. With everything else going on we all need a mental break. Please please reconsider.,In person classes or lower the tuition significantly. NOT WORTH THE PRICE.,Could we at least observe the holiday and take April 5th as opposed to April 6th??,These random days will do nothing for the kids. Make them Monday‚Äôs and Fridays if you can‚Äôt give them a whole week. Not sure what planet some people live on but if classes are virtual kids can travel whenever they want.,Virginia Tech what is your plan to enforce that these days are truly a ‚Äúbreak‚Äù? I respect that over fall break you encourage students to reach out to college deans to ensure that professors are keeping the break in mind when assigning homework. However::: will this truly be plausible for one-day breaks in the middle of the week? How do we know professors won‚Äôt just assign extra work and make it due the day after the ‚Äúbreak‚Äù? I‚Äôd to think that I can use those days off like I would my spring break - sleeping in::: relaxing::: maybe hiking::: etc. - NOT by having to watch extra lectures or catch up on homework. Please consider this in your decision.,As an out of state student::: that‚Äôs a long time to go without seeing my family..,If all classes are on line. Why would students return to dorms? WhT am I missing?,Graduation better be in person.,If the students wear their masks::: and my DS says everyone he comes into contact with is::: there should be no reason to not have in person classes.,What‚Äôs the point of a spring break then::: just don‚Äôt do it and let us have an early summer. Likely we will have assignments that we will be working on during these ‚Äúbreaks‚Äù anyway. This is ridiculous,How on earth is a Wednesday off supposed to mean anything? Make them all Monday‚Äôs and Friday‚Äôs so it at least feels like a break from working.,really?? i just want a long break where i can relax instead of these ‚Äúspring break days‚Äù consisting of schoolwork the whole time.,Thanks VT! This will be an unpopular decision::: but it‚Äôs the right thing to do. Especially given the recent outlook nationally. This virus is only getting worse and worse.,When will professors need to commit their intention for online vs in person so that Hokies are able to make informed decisions as to where they want to live for Spring semester? Too many courses were changed last minute in the Fall and many felt like it was a bait and switch. Now that you will have had a semester under your belt::: can you not require this decision by professors to be made earlier? Are there opptys for students to be in person and have professor remote in?,Terrible decision and complete disregard for student mental health. Professors don‚Äôt follow ‚Äúone day breaks.‚Äù Let alone one day breaks in the middle of the week::: who makes these decisions?,It‚Äôs funny because they reduce our spring break to ‚Äústop the spread of Covid‚Äù meanwhile they open up dorms and expect no cases!,This is gonna cause a huge spike in mental health issues/burnout before y‚Äôall know it....might wanna throw some more $ Cook‚Äôs way ASAP.,I would love to see some real statistics to show how many have had any worse symptoms than the regular flu and if they ended up hospitalized. To change the way these kids get to experience their college years is so sad and uncalled for. Has anyone seen real numbers for the regular flu and the coronavirus.,Sooooo are off campus students allowed to eat on campus if they have on campus classes or are they still going to inconvenience the heck out of us??,I‚Äôm lonely bros üò™ I‚Äôm really hoping for mostly in-person/ hybrid classes. We can pull it off::: right?,And graduation will be.... in person????? Cross fingers!!! Ya!!!!!üë©‚Äçüéì,Sorry to hear that for you. Maybe a change down the road. Hope!,Excellent idea to have five one-day breaks. Proud to be an alum Virginia Tech,What next::: the Easter bunny brings kale and quinoa!!? So happy my kid is almost done with VT. Any alumni donations from now on will be ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù (as in virtually non-existent),Good going VT You are the best!!,Nah that‚Äôs not ‚Äúspring break‚Äù I‚Äôm still sending it somewhere tropical üòé,My son who took the fall off is now thinking about taking spring off too. I‚Äôm behind him üíØ. Hopefully fall 2021 will be back to normal. Those that came home for break said that VT is a ghost town. So sad for those businesses and for the students wanting a college experience. Those in dorms have to be going stir crazy.,I am so sad for these kids. Especially the seniors,Ridiculous! Already planning for the worst to happen!,This spring break idea is a horrible one.,Imagine splitting up spring break::: what a joke. Smh,I really wish we could all stay respectful and have an intelligent conversation about this. The hatred in some of these comments is not in line with the values we're meant to embody as Hokies (also::: considering we're one of the best STEM schools in Virginia::: you'd think some people would have more respect for the science that clearly shows that COVID-19 is a threat::: even to people in our age group). As a student::: I don't see why we can't acknowledge that this is a stress-inducing and inefficient solution while also acknowledging that holding spring break as normal may not have been the best idea during a pandemic when I firsthand have seen countless students refusing to follow COVID-19 guidelines set by the university. I know we're all upset about Tech handing us an option that only adds to our stress::: but that doesn't mean we should suddenly pretend the pandemic was going to be over by March and act like our fellow Hokies haven't been breaking the rules. Personally think that Tech could have mitigated this by having harsher consequences for those who have been acting carelessly::: but I guess it's too late for that now...,Comment on the virus & prognosis & life risks...,Yall are crazy if you think I'm giving up spring break,In most responses the University has taken to COVID::: the friendly::: happy::: Hokie Spirit and traditions that make Va Tech feel like HOME and inspire lifelong alumni loyalty have been diminished. Va Tech is running out of time with the current students and needs to be way MORE CREATIVE in their response to COVID. Our best loved traditions not only inspire loyalty::: but allow the hard working students to blow off steam::: stimulating emotional balance and mental well being.  I am a VT alumni with two daughters at two different ACC schools::: Va Tech and Ga Tech. My GT daughter JUMPED for joy when she won the lottery to attend a football game and got to yell::: cheer and blow off steam at the game. The euphoria lasted over a week and provided a much needed emotional recharge. Va Tech should put the maximum number of students allowed in the stadium. Push back on the state government to increase that maximum::: because the stadium can easily hold more than 1000 safely distanced and they should think outside the box to include more students in the fan experience. How about a giant screen::: the cheer leaders and 1000 more students in the baseball stadium? Get them JUMPING::: cheering and yelling LET‚ÄôS GO HOKIES!! So loud everyone in Lane can hear them! A school whose fans are measured on the Richter Scale can surely do better than silent paper cut outs.  While I understand the need to keep the Va Tech and Blacksburg Community safe::: Spring Break provides hard working students with a necessary emotional and mental outlet and recharge::: allowing them to push through the rest of the semester. ‚ÄúWork Hard/Play Hard‚Äù is a phrase because humans need balance. If the university goes forward with the 5 single day off plan::: they need to do a better job of providing for the emotional well being of students who are starting to view HOKIE STONE in terms of PRISON GRAY.  These days must be free from school work::: by making an unbreakable::: ‚Äúnothing due the next class‚Äù rule::: and they must replace the physical::: emotional::: fun aspects a real spring break would have provided. Some ideas are: distanced drill field & lane stadium games where friend pods can compete against other pods to win prizes::: bussed outings to the cascades & other bucket list trails::: floats down the new river::: many small group service events::: and other bucket list items. It doesn‚Äôt have to fancy::: but it does have to be fun::: outside and spirit building. At Ga Tech they did their annual cake race in staggered heats::: Va Tech could do the 3.2 the same way allowing the event to continue. The Big Event could be split across several weekends allowing negative testing Hokies to help the surrounding community. Surely::: our outstanding corps of cadets who are experts in both leadership and logistics could help make these plans work?  Look at every traditional Va Tech event and find a safe way to implement and then look at all the experience/ well being factors of spring break and add those elements to the days off. Anything less::: will be a failure to live up to our ‚ÄúUt Prosim‚Äù motto::: because in this case the University must find better ways to serve the students::: who came to the amazing place that is Va Tech to learn and grow through these traditions and experiences.,"I'm sorry how do you think this is better for ANYONE? No spring break for students to decompress and any employees you have with kids who DO have a real spring break will need to look into child care. Tech you are seriously messing up this year.

Tomorrow::: Oct. 12::: #VirginiaTech will proudly observe Indigenous Peoples Day.  As a land-grant university::: we owe our institution‚Äôs existence::: in part::: to lands west of the Mississippi River that were confiscated from Indigenous peoples and sold to fund the founding of our nation‚Äôs land-grant institutions::: including Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College in 1872. And today‚Äôs Indigenous students at Virginia Tech also come from every corner of the commonwealth and more distant geographic areas.  We encourage the community to reflect on the history of the Blacksburg area ‚Äî and on the Inclusive VT future that we will continue to build together.

Now::: leadership has decided to require a large amount of employees to be tested regularly even if they have no symptoms. If they choose not to comply with the newly required testing::: they will be forced to not return to work and do so without the ability to access their personal time. ""Leave without pay""",What are the metrics for reducing regulations and what regulations might be reduced? Current rules are stricter than in the general population.

Starting Monday::: Sept. 21::: Virginia Tech will increase student testing with 2:::000 open testing appointments each week. A portion of this additional testing will be dedicated to the new mandatory random prevalence testing for all undergraduate students in Blacksburg and pooled testing will also begin.  VTNEWS.VT.EDU A message from President Tim Sands: Implementing mandatory random prevalence testing,2020-09-18 16:36:02,I'd much prefer this system to a forced shutdown of campus. Good job üëç. Let's do our best to preserve hybrid learning in the Spring semester::: starting by tracking cases and enforcing the rules.,Awesome job!!,What type of test will be used for the random sampling? Saliva? Long swab? Other? Thanks!,So this is for both off and on campus students?,Yes I would love to be shoved in a mass testing site with thousands of students passing though üôÑ I feel that I'd be more likely to be exposed by getting tested than just staying home :/,Does this anger anyone else? Seems a violation of rights on top of currently tolerating paying full price tuition for an online education::: off campus housing/ expenses and activity fees (which are not available). Have we lost our minds?!?,Only undergraduate?,Hmm,My undergrad is 100 percent online and will not be submitting to ‚Äòmandatory‚Äô random Covid tests. Thanks but no thanks.,Aiko Martinez,Still see people maskless outdoors anyways::: there are 799 positive cases on campus now,Proud to be a Hokie.,In New York::: the random test results: more than 40% people have antibodies already.,I don‚Äôt like the direction Virginia Tech has been moving of late. These draconian policies are not consistent with the Constitution nor do they necessarily keep people safer. Tech is not a private University.,She also recommended to have more in person classes. If this is helpful could more in person learning take place::: especially since she said most cases are not tracked back to the classroom?,VT is doing great::: thank you!!!,We Virginians will pay the price when Lord Northam decrees that the college 'case numbers' warrant another shutdown. Our gyms will be closed::: the outdoor basketball hoops boarded up::: our tennis courts will be denetted::: and our parks will be closed. We will have to suffer through the winter without access to our health facilities. All for what? A handful of 'asymptomatic carriers' around the growing number of establishments that have the power to 'mandate' a test or vaccine. Virginia Tech is now one of those places. Wow!  Is there an out for students who like me would have resisted health screenings MANDATED by what was supposed to be the academic institution I pay to provide a quality education?,Is this testing for the undergraduate population only?,Will you be providing PCR testing and antibody testing?

What if a student has already tested positive and then displays antibody positive?,What about employees ?,"How many ""random students"" will be selected each week?",Well done Hokies!,Niyousha Dadras,Verbose,Why are they randomly testing?,This is not enough. VT should implement the same testing protocols as UIUC::: including locking students::: faculty::: and staff out of building without a test result within the previous four days.,Please stop With the mask photos. What‚Äôs the point?,Good job VT! I don‚Äôt understand why parents disagree with random testing. The data helps the college prepare and track the spread. No one is being punished nor is anything being taken away. Rules aren‚Äôt changing. Would you prefer they do nothing and they all go home? VT is helping everyone stay safe being proactive. Why is this so hard to grasp?,Is this just testing for positive/ negative cases or testing for antibodies too? If this gets them all back in the classroom sooner - then do it!!

Students are stressed out over it::: students who busted their fannies to get in the school now receive a slap in the face in return for their money. Please don‚Äôt tell me you care about my child. It‚Äôs become obvious you couldn‚Äôt care less! Shame on you VT! I send a vote of No Confidence! And a sexual assault in the ‚Äúparty dorm‚Äù! Seriously? Don‚Äôt worry VT. The world is watching. The sad part is::: these students degrees won‚Äôt be worth the paper they are printed on.,I'm glad Mike Friedlander stressed that we don't know what this virus can do long-term and how risky it is to expose yourself.,Would also be nice to see the tests that ARC labs is doing reflected on the dashboard. It is extremely misleading to see a drop in positives and tests given when the reality is that ARC labs is preforming a large number of test that aren't being included in the dashboard.,Please consider adding information to the dashboard showing the number of students in isolation waiting on results as well the number isolating because of exposure and whether they are on or off campus as well as the number released because they were negative and the number who developed symptoms requiring further testing.,You've successfully denied the state of our town and our county in order to keep the money flowing. The end game is that the money expected from deceit is now much less than it would have been if you were just honest with everyone from the beginning. As a home owner in Blacksburg for 20 years I'm very concerned and honestly no longer willing to believe anything that is posted by Virginia Tech or the Town of Blacksburg.

I'd love to ask him why housing supervisors on Oak Lane are ""not legally allowed"" to share that someone in a sorority house has tested positive for COVID-19 when that can easily be done anonymously::: as proven by the way that various apartment complexes like Hunters Ridge and Chasewood Downs have been handling their COVID-19 cases. If student safety is the priority::: why are supervisors only allowed to share that someone has tested positive if that person says they're comfortable with that information being shared? To clarify::: this isn't about sending out an email saying exactly who tested positive -\-\ it's just sending out a notification in general. Can't believe that not sending out a notification is even an option. How many students are we going to put at risk with this?",Thought this would be about 9/11..,Great let's drain the tax base with too many operable buildings already and expunge private independent citizens with closed to the public buildings.

A team of Virginia Tech researchers are testing wastewater at 15 campus sites for the presence of the novel coronavirus::: enabling the university to find out if there‚Äôs a potential COVID-19 outbreak coming and proactively target testing accordingly.  By doing this kind of sewage epidemiology::: we can identify cases that are pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic ‚Äî detecting the virus before it spreads.  VTNEWS.VT.EDU Virginia Tech researchers begin testing campus wastewater for COVID-19,2020-09-09 09:44:00,UVA (we're a house dividedü§£ ) is also doing this.,My daughter has only been tested once,Dave interesting,#smartpeople,Rachel Oksa,Tom Heiman,As a parent I‚Äôm glad that my daughter has tested negative twice living on campus. I think the kids are taking this seriously and they‚Äôre behaving responsible. They deserve to have a college experience. They‚Äôre on their dorms on close proximity to each other::: so far so good.,Clemson doing this also. My youngest college kiddo there.,Are you going to share the results on the dashboard since transparency is good?,Don,I saw a news story on the University of Arizona last week::: where they tested a dorm after wastewater testing picked up the virus. They immediately tested::: found one positive student and one positive staff.,10 years from now they'll be testing the water for sugar trying to prevent the great diabetes crisis,doesnt the spike in positive cases of on campus students already show you signs of an outbreak? or will you wait long enough for it to get out of control before you decide to do something? Ut Prosim only if it benefits your bank account right::: timmy?,I bet that job stinks. Jk...womp::: womp.,Sandra Beckstoffer,"Glad to see they are continuing to work on things that can help counteract the tendency of young people to believe it can't happen to them and find additional ways to keep tabs on things.  Had a serious almost ""in your face"" converstion with my junior at UMD this week about just what is and is not ""doing your part"" to keep the community safe. I focused a lot on what it will mean to people in the local community and as kids are sent home (taking their germs with them) if the school closes down before Thanksgiving. I hoped that framing it that way might help since guilt and concern for others seems to motivate that age group more that worry over self.  I saw the article in the Roanoke paper about how VT is moving some students to make more room for isolation space. While I empathize with the student who shared her disappointment::: I will not jump on the bandwagon of ""THEY should have planned for more."" The students (who like to tell us they are ""adults"" now and should be treated as such) have a responsibility here to do their part to limit the spread.  The more the students can be persuaded to take it seriously::: the better the plan will work and the more likely it will be that there can be some semblance of ""normal college life"" sooner rather than later. At least that is what I am hoping for my Hokie freshman. I hate that his first semester is unfolding this way.  Stepping off soapbox now. Thanks for listening :-)",This is good but you could've just gone online for the school year.

The #VirginiaTech COVID-19 dashboard has been updated. ‚û°Ô∏è Newly confirmed cases (Aug. 31 to Sept. 6): 327 ‚Äî 324 for students and three for employees ‚û°Ô∏è On-campus students in designated isolation/quarantine spaces: 119 ‚û°Ô∏è Cumulative total of positive COVID-19 test results since Aug. 3: 500 for students and three for employees ‚¨áÔ∏è More information in the story below  Please note that this dashboard only includes data from testing performed at VT through the Schiffert Health Center. Test results from off-campus labs::: clinics::: and private health care providers are combined with data from Schiffert and reflected in the Virginia Department of Health reports (bit.ly/vdhdata).  VTNEWS.VT.EDU University launches dashboard updates each weekday,2020-09-08 14:13:00,Virginia Tech does the total number of positive tests (503) reflect the number of positive results or number of students who tested positive? There is some confusion about whether this number indicates a smaller number of re-tested students (I.e. 100 infected students each tested several times) rather than an actual number of infected students. TIA.,My daughter just told me her gym class for today just went virtual. Is this just for today for some reason? Or is it all gym classes? We paid for the in-person membership...,If a student‚Äôs classes have been moved online::: officially or otherwise::: can the student be allowed to go home (not move out::: just go home) for a few weeks or::: perhaps longer::: without fear of losing their housing contract??? If they have in-person classes in the spring semester::: the room they are paying for should be waiting for them! A student should have the right to do what they feel they need to do to keep safe! Protecting oneself should not have a punitive outcome. Losing their contract by going home for two weeks may have been a VT rule before the pandemic::: but why on earth would you enforce that now?!? And::: perhaps::: if they go home::: they should stay home this semester-\-\but give them that choice::: without worrying about housing insecurity next semester. A student::: along with their family::: should be able to make that decision without fear or worry that they won‚Äôt have a room next semester! Come on now!!! Please change your stance on this issue during this very difficult and stressful time! Why wouldn‚Äôt you??? Not asking for a refund::: just the freedom to make a personal decision about one‚Äôs own safety::: without added unnecessary worry or obstacles! Treat them like family (your Hokie family::: remember?) and leave the light on!,I'm waiting on my test now::: bc of students. Ive been waiting since Saturday and work in dunkin at hokie grill. Uts rudiculous that they are putting so many people in danger.,College should consider doubling putting Covid positive students if not already doing so,This is all informative::: but what they haven‚Äôt told you I‚Äôd that the average length of positive for the students is approx 4 days before they then test negative and the number even showing any symptoms is less than 1%::: got that from a friend that works on campus::: this virus doesn‚Äôt affect the young hardly at all::: so the last thing we want is them closing down and sending them home around grandma and grandpa... let them all stay together::: attend class and get immunities.,are these just on campus numbers? because they don't even come close to matching what the VDH is reporting for Montgomery County,My students are saying they are having a difficult time getting tested at Schiffert especially if they live off campus. They say the wait times for appointments are very lengthy (over 2 weeks).  Do we know the rate of infection (R0) in the town or within the student population? This would be an amazingly helpful and transparent number to display on the dashboard.,"Does the dashboard include the numbers from ARC testing labs that has set up in Schiffeet? I'm being the answer in no and that's why your numbers have taken a convenient nose dive. The numbers in the county and the numbers provided by the dashboard doesn't support ""no community spread"" unless the university is omitting those positives from the dashboard. The current dashboard numbers also seem to conflict with the need for additional quarantine bedding.",They are definitely not getting covid from the classroom so why cancel in person class? My son is a 3rd year engineering student and needs in person classes not all online.  Cancel football before cancelling in person classes And REFUND the fees I paid:::,Did I miss the hospitalization rate? I think it's zero. ü§î,I know its a bit alarming to see the cases increasing. However... I will say Virginia Tech is doing a lot correct that many other colleges should have done...like University of GA and Georgia Tech!,Agree.,Check out the cumulative cases chart for the county here: https:// usafacts.org/ visualizations/ coronavirus-covi d-19-spread-map /state/ virginia/county/ montgomery-count y?fbclid=IwAR0f 82TfK-CX9Sb1BIG yiUYch47iuO22kM eVasGtFF1uZgLZo HYBhkL-36I  It‚Äôs pretty clear the impact in person classes have had. The numbers are all numbers for Montgomery County::: they include VT‚Äôs numbers. As of Sept.6th (last VT dashboard update) the cases at VT made up 52% (503/969) of the overall county cases.  Also want to note that Montgomery county is now officially a ‚ÄúHot Spot‚Äù (source: https:// www.nytimes.com/ interactive/ 2020/us/ coronavirus-us-c ases.amp.html)  Hope we get off of that list soon!,Based on the comments here::: I hope Virginia Tech takes this as a long overdue lesson on the need to ramp up student health services. Schifferts always done a pisspoor job of meeting the needs of the student population and wasn‚Äôt remotely prepared to handle the decision the school made re reopening.,All my classes moved online after the add/drop deadline and I‚Äôm residing more than 50 miles away. I called bursar office and they said bo refund at all because it passed the add/drop deadline?!? Ridiculous!,Ilyes Adjerid,Why are there no off-campus statistics?,My daughter says those numbers are not accurate... She says it's higherüôÑ,The data below the chart isn't updated::: it only reports thru August; not sure how that helps,#FacebookDoctors üò© #GoHokies üíï,This isn‚Äôt going well now is it? ü§î,Can you also include the stats on how many students who test positive actually go on to have symptoms and actually get sick?,My son's off campus housing::: yet we paid a list of fees for on campus services. His professors already call all in person classes off and now he's all online. Any refund here as he hasn't and will not use any services we paid for?,Students in East Egg were asked to move out via email this morning to be moved into other dorms because Tech has run out of rooms for isolating students. Why not just transition the school to non-essential operations and all virtual learning if it‚Äôs gotten bad enough to have to relocate healthy students???,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To preserve public health::: #VirginiaTech and Town of Blacksburg Government will prohibit tailgating during the fall season in university and town parking lots and public spaces.  Instead::: fans are asked to safely ‚Äúhomegate‚Äù with family members or pods for all fall sporting events.  Virginia Tech Athletics continues to work through their plans for the fall::: guided by health guidelines; the health and safety of athletes::: staff::: and the broader community; as well as guidance from the NCAA::: the ACC::: and the Commonwealth of Virginia. We will share more information as soon as we can.

Seems every post is what they cannot do.,This too shall pass HOKIES.,So students don‚Äôt have to move their cars?,At least we‚Äôre still having football (for now). That in itself will give us something to look forward to. Go Hokies!,Y‚Äôall don‚Äôt let us do anything do you. Don‚Äôt why I bothered staying a dorm::: it‚Äôs the only place I can be without y‚Äôall harassing me.,Quite possibly one of the most non-sensical things I've seen in a while. So rather than being outside they'll gather indoors where virus spreads much more readily. This while the university has set up dozens of tents on campus to get students outdoors to reduce interior contacts and spread.,It‚Äôs the new world of ‚Äúcan‚Äôt do‚Äù. What is this teaching students? Most people who are successful have built their lives around ‚Äúcan do‚Äù. Now all our leaders are setting a ‚Äúcan‚Äôt do‚Äù example. I am so tired of this - because I know ‚ÄúI can!‚Äù,Not going to lie::: this one doesn‚Äôt make sense to me. If we want to prevent spread of Covid::: encouraging people to attend small outdoor gatherings like a tailgate with approx 15 people is the perfect way to encourage safe socially distanced interaction. Allowing tailgates with max number of people seems like perfect sense. Kids will still party::: why not give them this chance to do so with a safe set of parameters in place?,Crazy !!!!!!,"""It not tailgating...it 's peacefully protesting our opponent ::: officer""",Alumni/general admission won‚Äôt be at most games so that will take care of itself.

Btw::: this is just another policy that makes no logical sense. Students go outside to socialize unless your tailgating then you Must go inside where studies show a higher transmission rate. ü§ê,Put some protest signs on your car and call your tailgate a demonstration.

Ummm....that does not make sense. Are they really expecting kids will pay for a student ticket to sit in their cars and watch the game in the Lane Stadium parking lot? Are there really::: 1000 people who would do that? Sorry but with this news it is time to roll out the refunds to disappointed student fans!,Cardboard fans for the parking lot. Take my money now!!!

"""Looking ahead::: should the number of new cases not stabilize and decline::: we will consider temporarily scaling back university operations consistent with our planning. Just as important as what the university does as a whole is what each of us does as an individual.""  Read the full message from President Sands::: following the #VirginiaTech COVID-19 dashboard update. ‚¨áÔ∏è  VTNEWS.VT.EDU From President Tim Sands: Virginia Tech continues to monitor new cases",2020-09-01 11:30:00,VT you are doing the best you can. As a parent I applaud your efforts. My daughter who is a sophomore and living on campus says many students are wearing masks.,Can you point me in the direction of the scale back info::: that you are looking ahead to do. Where can we find this plan?,I love VT but they were fools to bring everyone on campus during a pandemic. College kids have proven themselves not responsible at both tech and radford. They should have only brought students who have required labs and left everyone else to do online instruction. And someone tell this clown wearing a mask for an individual interview is just silly.,"The mutation rate of covid-19 virus will be different from that of previous influenza viruses because of its dehydration rate... Etc.. It is slower than other influenza viruses (including SARS). Therefore::: in summer::: covid-19 virus can still be active and effective to spread::: and some become more harmful::: and some become milder::: but this is not entirely accurate because of the virus In the early stage of the epidemic::: people have been able to deal with the virus's SOP::: so the mortality rate is obviously improved compared with the initial stage One Two antibodies were found in one person in Japan. Two Three different virus strains were found in Malaysia. Three Under the electron microscope on the west coast of the United States::: the virus has long tentacles that can extend to nearby cells and inject venom. Four Five ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶„ÄÇ [Note 1] Covid-19 virus has a layer of lipid (or a mixture of proteins) on the outermost side::: resulting in the following One It is not easy for water to evaporate. Two It's not easy for the protein to go bad because the fat doesn't have to be transparent (or a mixture of proteins). ‚Ä¢ The virus can be suppressed by masks when it spreads. But there is a loophole. Masks still need to be worn when people are in crowded and closed spaces. Due to the different immune factors of each person::: viruses can survive in a few cells. Some viruses will gradually lose their infectivity (Facebook::: 8 / 20::: 8 / 24)::: and some viruses will be effectively activated again (Facebook::: 8 / 20::: 8 / 24). That's why there is obviously flu coming back every winter Covid-19 doesn't need winter. ... ‚Ä¢ Therefore::: if we do not take effective measures to eliminate covid-19 virus::: it is possible that the ""vaccine replacement speed"" will be in a race with the ""virus mutation speed"".  Yueh Chuan Lin",You'll do whatever it takes to keep that room and board money and then send them home. Come on ppl open your eyes,So the increase in positive cases at this point has to include the off campus students getting tested at Shiffert. Given that the first 2 weeks of testing were for on campus residential students::: it follows that of course #s of positive cases will rise. The question for Virginia Tech is whether on campus students will be sent home even if their #s remain low & it‚Äôs the students off campus who have the increase.,My daughter - a Masters Grad last year is working for a Tech scheduling Covid tests. Worked 21 hours yesterday and today. Clearly::: things are getting out of hand. I do and don‚Äôt blame the admin/ students. I can‚Äôt imagine sitting in your dorm::: apartment::: frat/sorority house As a Tech grad back in the ‚Äò70s::: I can‚Äôt imagine having the self discipline to not go out. I‚Äôm afraid the campus will close in a few weeks::: just like last Spring.,So here come the threats from the VT administration. Was waiting for this stage.,I appreciate and applaud Virginia Tech‚Äôs transparency about case numbers::: continued monitoring of student health::: and commitment to maintaining a healthy environment for students.  I think an increase in cases was to be expected and I‚Äôm happy to see VT respond appropriately. Great job::: Hokies! üß°,"Parents of a Junior VTCC who support the Universities efforts to this point and encourage PROCEEDING::: albeit with caution. This is the time to teach our young adults to ""adult"" through one of the many difficulties they will face in life.",Thank you for the hard and diligent work. My masked freshman daughter loves it there and is so happy to be a Hokie.,I like the classy mask in hokie colors!,Dont need a mask for the camera goofball,What a joke! Wake up VT! CDC revised their numbers to under 10k deaths in US due to CV19 alone. Other deaths averaged 2-3 comorbidities. Do you take us all for idiots?,This virus can get out of hand very quickly::: how many cases is too many? I hope for the community there is a real plan in place.,It is important VT be transparent with comprehensive data/numbers concerning full VT community.  VT Schiffert data includes on-campus students.  VDH data of Montgomery County includes VT off-campus & out of state students. As of 9/2::: 600 cumulative positive cases. VDH Blacksburg zip code data does not include OOS VT students.  VDH records Radford data as Radford City. Radford is economically included in Montgomery County (communities are closely intertwined). Radford 9/2::: 504 cumulative positive cases.  VT community total is significantly higher than 157 with a complete scope of all data.  Additionally::: VT required on and off campus students to return to the VT community::: has taken payment and is responsible for having known of possible unsafe actions of young adults.  Realize this is a huge undertaking::: but we are all in this together. Only by having all data can families make informed decisions.,Well duh. How many cases do we have to have before you do that?,As a parent of both a VT student and an Auburn student::: I would like to share this letter. Both of our children practiced social distancing::: did not attend parties and made good decisions. BOTH contracted COVID::: had mild symptoms and are now fine physically. They also now have immunity::: but they are struggling with the emotional toll the restrictions have taken. Please consider this letter from an Auburn parent...it is exceptionally well written!  My letter to Dr. Gogue. Copied to department heads::: student services and Governor Ivey.  _______________ _______________ _______________ _______________ _________  Please consider this a letter of sincere support and of strong suggestion.  I write this as a veteran teacher and a parent of a Senior at AU.  First::: I commend you for getting students and staff back on campus; this was not an easy feat::: and it was a bold decision in a time when public pressure didn‚Äôt welcome such courage. Second::: I encourage you to be forward thinking yet again and fully open campus::: including requiring professors (not in the high-risk subset) to teach in person. Our students need it::: and they deserve it. They had the courage to trust you::: take a leap of faith and come back to campus in light of a fearful public and skeptical government. Moreover::: they have been brave while facing this virus: spreading it (naturally)::: recovering from it::: remaining healthy after it::: and helping build immunity within the Auburn area. Our students should be valued::: applauded::: and celebrated- never targeted::: chastised::: or ostracized by the community they love. If the latter happens::: we will lose great students and families::: especially our Freshman.  The reality is that we knew positive cases would rise on campus given the students‚Äô collective travel and presence. We knew the students could catch the virus anywhere from anyone. We knew masks and social distancing were a precaution not a protection. And::: we all know that everyone (in an open society) will eventually get this virus like they get the flu: masks or no masks::: vaccine or no vaccine. I have had it and so will you. Our best advice to ourselves and to our students is to be realistic and positive::: take reasonable precautions::: and practice good overall health.  As I read posts from professors::: students and parents::: it‚Äôs disheartening to hear of the isolation::: division and disappointment alongside the more positive tales. Many educators and students (including our son) are making the best out of a difficult situation::: but most students are struggling. This current learning environment is not sustainable::: and it is not healthy::: because a meaningful life and education is rooted in social interaction and academic learning. Our commitment to educating the whole person needs to deepen now::: and our advocacy for our students needs to increase. Given recent advanced research::: the stability of our hospitals::: and the CDC revisions::: we must reevaluate our society‚Äôs response starting with our colleges and universities! Auburn University can continue its leadership in thought and action::: and they can be embolden by the following facts. One of our sons is back to classes-in person-at a college in Boston. Our daughter is back to in-person learning in high school. Our elementary & middle schools are open. Stores and restaurants are filled. Flights are packed. Our students are working on job sites. Folks are going back to their offices. Mask mandates are being lifted and so on. Let‚Äôs support our college students by offering the full college experience::: while we also learn from their battle with Covid-19 via studying their plasma and antibodies (voluntarily) in order to help the most vulnerable. We have a great opportunity to make a difference in the lives of our students and get our society back to normal with good health in mind.  Here is an editorial written by professors at my husband‚Äôs Alma mater::: the University of Notre Dame. They are advocating for their students to stay on campus and learn in person! Please read. I shared it on four AU/AL parent FB pages.  [https:// ndsmcobserver.co m/2020/08/ recalculating-th e-risks/](https:// ndsmcobserver.co m/2020/08/ recalculating-th e-risks/ ?fbclid=IwAR17-Z U8s85Rab6JCe4LR mS0kS4a2rypy8_J NL8rZfTkQxsdneM XqlNUuZ8)  Since government restrictions are of consequence::: I also called Governor Ivey and copied her. Perhaps our Alumni Associations can also implore our elected officials to support our universities and students more. We are in this together::: and we can do better together. War Eagle!  Respectfully:::  Marisa Novak::: M.Ed.  TN,My student has heard there was an outbreak among the Corps of Cadets and they are continually being retested. Same with the athletes. If someone re-tests positive is it counted as another positive case?,Never should have brought them back. #VTgreed,It is impossible to get a test. I know that kids are going to Roanoke and Hollins to get tested. Completely wrong. If VT wanted to have classes::: they should have had a support system to test and keep kids safe. Now those small towns surrounding VT will have to deal with the overflow of kids that need to be tested and possibly receive medical care.,Agreed with my fellow VTCC mom‚Äôs...the VTCC has done an outstanding job abiding by the guidelines set forth with the university as well as the city of Blacksburg. I personally witnessed this last week...all week. I also personally witnessed a gathering::: a VERY large gathering::: of students in a parking lot off campus that had to be disbanded by the police! Definitely a rumor about the Corps!!,VT please oh please do not close down. My son is a junior in the Corps and needs to be IN PERSON to train to be a future Army officer. Assess the severity of cases.::: not just numbers.,Frankly::: I think Universities::: my wonderful VT included::: should take a position and stay with it rather than oscillate back-and-forth. Regardless of which side you stand on::: they should stay the course rather than pander to diversity of opinions all of us alumni have.,I am sure they will scale back their fees and give refunds for the decreased services.,Nice face diaper! President Tim Sams looks like a very useful tool. So very sad to see such a great university drop to it's knees to virtue signal about a fake plandemic.,Keep trying to do the right thing VT. I have entrusted you with both of my kids. Help keep them safe and healthy while they follow the guidelines as well. Go Hokies!,"So disappointed with VT and their reaction to all this: however it's understandable with all the public pressure to be ""safe""::: which will always be unattainable.",Joe Quinlan,Darwin Koller,Please look at all the data before making a decision. Make a smart decision not a knee jerk.,How many students on campus?,We heard there were some big parties over the weekend. I don‚Äôt know if it was just a rumor or if there was any truth to it.

I‚Äôm in favor of any practical endeavor to remain healthy of course::: that said::: in the spirit of full disclosure::: will the ‚Äòbrown shirts‚Äô be on patrol?,We expect kids to follow the rules but then quite a few parents visited last weekend against the request of the school. We will never move forward if we all don‚Äôt cooperate.,It is necessary to improve the masks to make them reusable. When people predict that the production of masks will never meet people's needs::: or when they have trouble using masks::: some people sometimes find another excuse to deny the function and demand of masks. As time goes on::: the excuses will become normal and become correct and reasonable.,Keep working hard Hokies! Everyone knew the numbers would increase!

Don‚Äôt give up! üò∑üçÄü§ûüèªüôèüèª (I say this with the understanding that those who at positive are asymptotic or are not experiencing severe symptoms),Are they SICK or asymptomatic?

Better yet -for those who are positive-let‚Äôs hope they don‚Äôt get sick or only mild symptoms and recover how about?!,It's shocking how people can be so ignorant about the current circumstances. 150 cases jump in a week is just shocking and sad.,The last paragraph of this Dashboard article is troubling!

I am curious about the dashboard numbers. VDH shows 105 positives between Aug 9 and 30 for zipcode 24060. Zip 24061 shows 0 cases. Your dashboard has 178 new cases since August 9. Why the discrepancy? Are the Schiffert on campus student tests not being reported with 24061 data and instead being reported to the students home zipcode?,150+ and 28% of isolation rooms in use. When we they make the call to send students home? I need my daughter safe,You had the freedom of choice both parents and students.,The amount of testing required to isolate asymptomatic transmission is not possible. You need to move to virtual instruction.,96% of people that died of covid had underlying medical conditions.,Virginia Tech *needs* to invest in increasing its testing capacity asap. 1:::000 tests a week is a recipe for disaster. At that rate::: Virginia Tech wouldn't finish testing its entire undergraduate student body by the end of the semester::: and as we know::: testing only provides a snapshot of the health for an individual. Just because a student::: faculty::: or staff member was healthy last week and wasn't spreading the virus::: doesn't mean that they are healthy this week and not spreading the virus. Without identifying and isolating such cases of asymptomatic spread::: I am skeptical about the long-term sustainability of Virginia Tech's opening. More testing IS possible. The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaig ne tested 10:::000 students/ faculty/staff in ONE day last week (1% of all testing nationwide!)::: but the administration would need to identify this as a priority and invest accordingly.  Additionally::: I would like to see more transparency from Virginia Tech about what levels of spread they will accept before taking certain actions like a two week shutdown (see Notre Dame) or a full move to online classes (see UNC). This way::: students and parents know what to expect if spread hits certain levels::: and town members wouldn't have the feeling of::: 'How long are they going to push this for.' This information should be published via VT News and social media as well as incorporated into the dashboard.,Any parent or student who is not happy with VT can always opt to go home and do virtual classes. VT is not forcing you to be on campus or in Blacksburg!,A regular testing schedule is highly recommended.,Will there be community access or just for employees/ students? VCU offers community access.,How frequently will the updates occur going forward?,https:// pbs.twimg.com/ media/ ETvuIPlXQAIjiOg. jpg,"I find it interesting that this dashboard shows only 1:::000 tests for the entire week - especially considering Schiffert ran out of appointments for days and the call line is so busy that students cannot even make appointments anymore. Didn't Virginia Tech boast how they can process 1:::000 tests a day? I got tested last week and still have yet to hear. This makes the dashboard appear inaccurate. The lack of ""transparency"" from our school is very concerning.",Thank you VT for watching out for everyone,It‚Äôs Thursday and there is no update yet... when can we expect these ‚Äúmore frequent updates‚Äù?,Close down!!!!!,VT admin @ professors and students.,Is there going to be a cycle of testing of people that are living on campus? For example::: are the students that tested when they first arrived going to be tested two weeks from now to see the changes? Would have liked to see a plan in place to consistently test the kids that live in such confined spaces.,Would this mean VT has tested only 1/3 of the student population?,How many haves colds::: the flu stds?,üëèüèª,Are Virginia Tech numbers being reported to the Virginia Department of Health? VDH numbers in Montgomery County look low.,I don't understand why VT didn't learn anything from UNC and NC State failed starts ... what was the harm in going all virtual for first 8 weeks or so?,Thank you VT for watching out for everyone,DD was just texting that campus police aren‚Äôt enforcing masks and just telling students to go back to their dorms. It‚Äôs very upsetting to those willing to do their part. She really doesn‚Äôt want to be sent home.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Having an OOS student taking 100% online from home is not what we want. Being on campus and having the opportunity to meet others::: join clubs::: have in person or hybrid classes is a better option. Being an ‚Äúadult‚Äù means making good choices::: following rules::: and being responsible.

This is their time! These are their futures!,This is a friend packing up their student at another university after three weeks because they closed the dorms. Starting later gives VT and our students a chance to learn and choose different options. We must encourage our students to choose to follow the rules and focus on everyone's best interest.

I don‚Äôt currently have students at VT but I am so glad VT is giving it their all to try to bring some normalcy back to these young people.,It‚Äôs working for my daughter and I am actually glad VT has these rules in place.

It would be so helpful to know how many of these positive cases resulted in hospitalization or (God-forbid) death. It was also be helpful to know the recovery rate per week and number of students coming out of quarantine. Those are more accurate indicators of the severity of the issue! Many who test positive are asymptomatic and while they need to be quarantined to prevent spread i would feel far better knowing that as a parent!,The university has access to it's own testing facility and results are coming in on a daily basis.

"A message from Frank Shushok Jr.::: VP for Virginia Tech Student Affairs:  ""While developmental and collaborative approaches are the norm at Virginia Tech::: it is now clear that this public health crisis will not be solved without clear and definitive boundaries that are enforced with swift and serious action. The following requirements are to provide clarity in your decision-making:  üö® There should not be ANY non-university sanctioned/monitored gatherings::: on or off campus::: larger than 15 people.  üö® Face masks/coverings should be worn at all social gatherings::: with 6-foot physical distancing. Individuals should remove themselves from situations where this is not possible.  üö® Independent outdoor exercise is the only exception to the obligation of the face covering requirement.  To be clear::: failure to follow these expectations is considered endangering the welfare of others and will result in immediate interim suspension and removal from campus housing. Immediate interim suspension means no academic classes or student activities until a full student conduct hearing is complete. This will adversely impact your academic career.  Our student conduct program is typically designed with opportunities built in to learn from one‚Äôs mistakes. Yet these aren‚Äôt typical times. The nature of the pandemic means the health and well-being of our community must be the values that win the day. Therefore::: Virginia Tech will take swift action for all violations::: and the academic career of all involved will be impacted.  I am counting on ALL of us. Let‚Äôs get this right. Now.""",2020-08-24 00:13:20,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So here are the questions:  Is the University utilizing VA Executive order 67 & 68 in their determination process for student punishment or has the University set its own guidelines that are being enforced even off campus?  If Hokies are following the guidelines in Virginia Executive Order 67 & 68 can/should the University punish them?  If the student was in compliance with the two orders and VTPD or BPD are called will the students records reflect they were in compliance and no punishment issued or will they face punishment regardless? ü§îü§îü§îü§îü§îü§îü§îü§îü§îü§îü§îü§îü§î",The university is completely overstepping their boundaries and is way out of line to even think they have the right to govern off campus students actions through student conduct violations.

We are pleased to announce that the BOV voted unanimously this afternoon to rename two of our campus residence halls after African Americans who inspired the Hokie community and played an important role in shaping Virginia Tech.  The residence hall formerly known as Lee Hall will be named after the late William and Janie Hoge::: a local African American couple who played a critical role in the success and well-being of the first African American students attending Virginia Polytechnic Institute in the 1950s.  The residence hall formerly known as Barringer Hall will be named after James Leslie Whitehurst Jr. ‚Äô63::: the first Black student permitted to live on campus in 1961 and a U.S. Air Force veteran.  VTNEWS.VT.EDU Board of Visitors Executive Committee approves new names for residence halls,2020-08-13 21:34:38,"Everyone: ""VT needs to stop price gouging students and the residents of Blacksburg""  Virginia Tech: ""How about we change the names of some buildings. I'm sure that will fix things!""",All these snowflakes melting down over a simple name change.... Sad.,I think the name changes are fine and the new names chosen are good picks. That said::: I think the next few buildings should be named after Va Tech Alumni killed in action in service to the country. They never got a chance to move on to more things::: so the least we can do is recognize their sacrifice.,All those buildings on campus with NO NAME at all::: and you couldn't have honored these folks with one of those?,Why is it not ok to disagree with this change? I thought ‚Äòtolerance‚Äô was a thing...,I‚Äôm assuming most people that are happy about the change aren‚Äôt true Virginians. It‚Äôs not a race thing to me. I always felt those who died for VA believed in their state and heritage. I am not sure why we are oppressing people for their heritage::: while celebrating others for their heritage. It seems awfully hypocritical. I am a proud Virginian who studied the Civil War at VT under the great Professor Robertson. I never owned a slave::: but I‚Äôm very proud of my state and feel sadness when I pass a Confederate and Union Soldier(s) statue or memorial. Those Americans gave their lives. Yes::: both sides were Americans. I feel that is what is being forgotten.,As a former resident of 369 Hoge Hall this makes me ü¶É proud.

Hello Hoge and Whitehurst Halls.,I‚Äôm indifferent to the change. It didn‚Äôt matter either way and that‚Äôs what VT didn‚Äôt understand. All the current students that mention those halls will still use them by their original names haha.,"Some of you all are ridiculous::: getting triggered over this. Changing the name has no impact on your past experiences at Tech. You know what will happen? In the future::: you will drive through campus with your kids::: point out your old dorm and say::: ""That was my old dorm. It was called Lee Hall back then. Good times."" End scene.",So we can't get LaPorte Hall for a cadet dorm because he only gave his life::: not his money::: in defense of fellow students still???,I lived in Barringer for two years. Happy to see the name retired in order to honor a trailblazer and someone whose career embodied the spirit of Ut Prosim.,UC Berkeley just doin his job on the east coast. God Bless the Lee and Barringer families. Liviu Librescu deserves this if you‚Äôre gonna start erasing the campus history.,Thank you VT! ‚ù§Ô∏èüß°,Bravo VT! When you know better::: you do better!,Why? I lived in Barringer as a freshman in 2001::: why the need for the change? Such incredible pandering to the woke nonsense. Nothing against the new namesakes::: has nothing to do with them. The placating is just too much::: what a joke,So glad to not be actually attending there anymore. What a shame::: the need to change everything everyone has known. Soon won‚Äôt be able to recognize anything on campus anymore if it keeps being changed.,As a proud Hokie(1976) and a Newman by marriage (Carol M. Newman Library) I fully support the Board of Visitor‚Äôs recent action renaming these resident halls. Virginia Tech::: the Commonwealth::: and our whole country has much work to do. How of many are aware that Blacksburg High School of 1970 was its first integrated graduating class (all 4 years at BHS)? Not that long ago in the big picture.,VT is heading in the right direction in dealing with its problematic racist past::: as the rest of the commonwealth addresses the same issues. Proud to be a Hokie alum today. Well done::: BofV Execs and President Sands.,The amount of racists in these comments is beyond me. Like yall are THAT PRESSED against a name change and are gonna stop supporting and donating to VT? You're telling me the reason yall donated was because of the names of halls? If so::: that is a very lousy reason. Nice job VT for adapting to the current times and not living in the past #Gokies,Great job VT! Proud to be a hokie Mama. My daughter will continue to be a proud hokie now and forever.,Pearson Hall and New Cadet Hall on the Upper Quad should have been named after Medal of Honor recipients Monteith and Thomas::: since their names were already on dorms that were torn down and not replaced.,Finally::: good decision out of VT,No more $$ for VT::: I am an alumni I am disgusted with actions such as this.,This is a sad day for VT. History is history. And while I don't support some of the alleged actions/views of Lee and Barringer::: they clearly did a lot of good as well. Today's #cancelculture looks for excuses to cancel than attributes to celebrate. If we use the same reasoning::: we should ignore all the good the MLK Jr. did for equality because he was a well documented misogynist. Under #cancelculture his negative misogynists views far outweigh - to the point of extreme egregiousness - all the good he brought the US in the realm of equality.,Lol look at all the snowflakes getting offended when they take the names of old racists off buildings. Y‚Äôall call millennials wimpy but you can‚Äôt even take a name change.,Bravo Virginia Tech!!! So proud to be an alumnus and to see the University paving a better future for BIPOC students like my daughter!!,This is a sad day for this Hokie because it‚Äôs horrible to watch the Hokie Nation attack itself. The unity from 2007 seems to be gone (by reading these comments). Expressing an opinion results in name calling and that‚Äôs not the Virginia Tech we should be. Sad. So very sad. üò¢,Oh look::: the local racists are coming out to comment.,This is is great. It also shows compassion. People like joe must not know what that feels like.,Say his name ... Liviu Librescu...he needs to be on a building now !!! https:// en.m.wikipedia.o rg/wiki/ Liviu_Librescu,I hope reading this makes people really stop and think. The first black student PERMITTED to live on campus....was only in 1961....,Good! Shocked to read that this decision offended some::: but this Hokie Family is proud of the name changes.,VT those are great names for dorms and you have several that don‚Äôt have a name already. Wow it would have been great to name the nice new modern dorms after these fine individuals as opposed to erasing history.,Spent the last few days being proud of my school.....now not so much. We will be lucky if this is all they change.,Nothing like pandering to the progressive left to bring everyone together. I'm sure Sands and the BOV are patting themselves on the back. All the buildings on campus are named for imperfect persons who served the university well. I guess we'll need additional reviews until they all pass the new liberal litmus test.,Just shows weakness to the ‚Äúwoke‚Äù mob. Where will it end? Names? Statues? The pylons?? It‚Äôs limitless::: you can find flaws and faults in everything and everyone. I had much more hope for Tech.,What‚Äôs next::: doing away with the ROTC. CORE? People do not be surprised if that happens.,I'm just gonna assume these people crying about correcting memorials to slavery actually didn't go to college. Good for you Tech::: another reason to be a supporter!,Reframing history and rewriting history are not the same thing. Proud to be a Hokie!,I‚Äôm excited and very pleased the Executive Committee of the Board of Visitors renamed Lee and Barringer dorms for William and Janie Hoge and James Leslie Whitehurst Jr. These African Americans made significant ground breaking contributions to the future of Virginia Tech and are very deserving of this long overdue honor.  Virginia Tech should be proud of bestowing this honor with their renaming of the dorms. Congratulations to both families! Great decision by VT!! üòä,So when do you plan on renaming New Cadet Hall after Mathew La Porte? The Air Force cadet who willingly gave his life to save other students back in 2007?,Well done VT! Keep it up - you‚Äôre not done yet,I will not be donating more money to VT . Had been giving since 1975. No more. Done! .,Way to go::: VT! This decision is long overdue::: and that it has finally happened makes me proud to be a Hokie.,Things change. It's okay. Go Tech!,As a '77 grad ::: married to a '75 grad::: sister and sister in law to 5 alumni::: and aunt to 3 VT grads-\-\I have never been more proud of my university!,So they didn‚Äôt give $$$$ and got buildings named after them! I need a building named after me! t least I gave them a crap load of tuition money!,Try naming dorms/ buildings that still don't have names...ex. New Hall West::: New Residence Hall East::: New Classroom Building.,Honor these families that deserve to be recognized. It‚Äôs a great decision. I‚Äôm A former Va Tech graduate. ( 1977) Congratulations to the Hoge And Whitehurst families!,Nice PR stunt::: Matthew LaPorte must be rolling around in his grave. I suppose it's for the best::: honoring fallen heroes doesn't appease political tension...,Very proud of this decision and admire those for whom the buildings were renamed.,Except ... why change Lee Hall? It appears most commenters (and the school administration) don‚Äôt know the history of the name. Sad!,So when are we naming a building after Librescu?,Why not wait and name new buildings after these people. My husband is the Hokie and I'm going to encourage him not to send donations to VT.,Way to go VT! Should really get those donations rolling in now.,"Now if you will please stop with the ""(That I may serve)"" after every use of Ut Prosim. We get it!",As long as they don‚Äôt change the name of hall named after the major who yelled ‚ÄúHELL NO‚Äù when ordered to retreat::: and then ran directly into the face of machine gun fire. Of course Lee sat on his horse in a safe location while he led his men.,Glad to see we are tackling the issues really affecting our community.,"Imagine renaming buildings that already have names::: when there are buildings named ""Classroom Building"" or ""New Res East"" on campus. Interesting.",Thought you‚Äôd be wiser than the sheep! Very disappointed!,So a school founded in 1872 in southwest va has ties to the confederacy. Imagine that! That‚Äôs what we get for bringing in a guy from Berkeley.,As an alumni::: I don‚Äôt think we should undo years of our VT tradition. Why not just name the new dorms after these fine people? Makes more sense to me.,Plenty of unnamed buildings on campus. Ever wondered why? Virginia Tech doesn‚Äôt understand its alumni base. Tim Sands‚Äô administration is a disgrace on this university.,So obvious and lessens any honest respect for great people who did bold things for VT and their race. Statues w/b nice commemoratives,I love VT and own my life to what I experienced there ...both good and bad....have problems with those of you who don‚Äôt.,Is everything in the state of va named after some confederate general?,Could VT put them on new buildings because won‚Äôt that offend Barringer and Lee families? Or are they just random names??,If VT had come to the table with this idea::: on their own::: I could applaud it::: but since they crumbled to the wind of the bully movement::: I can't. Wish it could have been an original idea::: but it wasn't. Guess I'll just roll my eyes when referring to my alma mater from now on... and btw::: I lived in NUF (New Undergraduate Facility) my Freshman year. They have since named it Cochran Hall::: whoever that is. At least we knew who Lee was...good or bad...ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,Covid that has no end in sight and potential war in the US is going to break most universities including Virginia tech. Racially focused agendas most likely won‚Äôt solve the real issues at hand. That‚Äôs the least of our problems now. A lot of conservative alumni have been distancing themselves from Schools for a few years as these issues just didn‚Äôt start a few months ago. Losing 1/2 of university funding from conservative donors will definitely hurt. Changing a name of a building won‚Äôt change either ideaology that isn‚Äôt going to give up its stance when someone feels they are being forcefully told what to do. Large endowment universities are very concerned about their future and Virginia tech isn‚Äôt even close to endowments and funds of other much larger and at times superior education.,Isn‚Äôt there a whitehurst building on campus already? Not for sure just thought there was,First decent thing you‚Äôve done in a while,Lived in both of these dorms during different summer sessions.,Great job VT ! Proud Hokie alum!,I lived in a very unique room in Lee Hall in the early 80s. It was symetrically positioned across from Burrus Hall on the 7th floor...room 733....the only room number that can be derived by taking the hall name and turn each letter upside down and backwards....co ol coincidence...n ow a cool memory.,Aren‚Äôt there several unnamed residence halls::: some of which are decades old?,Name a NEW building for them::: don't dishonor someone else's legacy!,Good. Now quit playing Liberty. CAUS 2001.,Very happy for this move::: but if only you could name the VTCC buildings after MOH recipients and not after the trailer man who donated a bunch of money.,Well done and glad to hear we have done this!,What a joke. üôÑ Shame on you::: VT. üëéüèº,WE‚ÄôRE DONE! No more money from this alumni! We‚Äôll be supporting Liberty University and Stetson University Athletics!,Was Lee Hall named for Robert E.

My problem is that they specifically sought out black people to name it after::: which is racist towards literally every other race. Why not give one of the nameless buildings the names of Hoge and Whitehurst? Y‚Äôall really trying to erase history. ‚ùÑÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è Do you want your participation trophy for changing a name? What‚Äôs next? We gonna name the support beams? We gonna cancel tacos because it‚Äôs cultural appropriation? When does it end? Where‚Äôs the line?,Great decision VT,Way to go VT!,Tardy but entirely appropriate::: thanks.,Thank you. That‚Äôs great. Change does not equal eracing. I like it.,Too sad that are trying to please those who want to erase history,Boo. Never bend to the rage mob.,THRILLED to change the line on my CV to Assistant Residential Learning Coordinator of Hoge Hall::: 2018-2019!!!,"Kind of hurts when they turned down all requests to name ""New Residence Hall"" after Librescu. Teacher::: Holocaust survivor::: victim of the shootings on April 16th.  Edit: I do want to voice that I support the changing of the resident halls names based on the histories if those individuals for whom those buildings were named. I am happy to see flexibility of the Board at Tech for replacing those names with better representatives for what the school stands for. My feelings still remain on the lack of support to change New Res back in 2007/2008 but I do support the actions by the Board.",Omg tech is staying current with the rest of the world. I finished in 75 and at that time it was a hotbed of racism except my buddies. on 5th floor Major Williams::: who held it together for me. They protected me from racial assaults coming from everywhere::: as that were the days of confederate flags in dorms and Dixie played at football games. The admin could never figure the liquid poison placed under my door night after night as the school‚Äôs first Resident Advisor of color::: but we survived.,Bunch of politically correct weenies. I don‚Äôt mind them naming buildings in honor of African Americans::: and I‚Äôm sure most if not all folks here are of the same opinion. But::: as a Virginia Tech alumni::: I am personally OFFENDED by VT caving to the ‚Äúwoke‚Äù crowd and removing the names Lee and Barringer! Hell::: Lee Hall wasn‚Äôt even named after Robert E. Lee! Shame on you VT. #gowokegoBROKE,*sigh* I love Virginia Tech. ‚ò∫Ô∏è love this::: love the flood of support comments... GO HOKIES!!  And y‚Äôall commenting that you‚Äôre upset about this name change... just proves that ignorance and racism is still rampant. When someone tells you::: ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt live in a dorm that glorifies someone who oppressed my people‚Äù::: how could your response be ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to erase history‚Äù? History isn‚Äôt being erased. We‚Äôre just looking at it from a new lens::: one that can tell apart the winners from the losers.  Leaving the building names means supporting a dark history of racism and oppression. Changing them means supporting Black students. I don‚Äôt think you have much to lose here but all to gain.,Why rename buildings when you have 2 residence halls on campus that still don't have names. Can we stop calling New Residence Hall East new::: it was built 22 years ago? The new names are good::: let's add them. I am sad to see the names replaced that were removed.  Claudius Lee served on the faculty for 50 years. He implemented a bell system in the upper quad. He was one of the best cadets in his graduating class and the editor of the yearbook. He is being discredited for a yearbook post from 1895 that was racist. We can see that as distasteful in 2020::: but was it considered to be that way in 1895? Let's not pretend as though Virginia Tech didn't bar people of color from attending the university for another 50 years after this yearbook post. Lee takes the fall::: but the whole university was racist in the first 80 years of its history.  I find it interesting that Virginia still has a governor in office who appeared in a photo with a man in blackface and a man in the KKK robe in a yearbook in 1984 and no one is pushing for him to be removed from office::: yet a man who had a racist post in a yearbook 90 years prior is having his name removed from a residence hall.,Here is the explanation from years ago by President Torgersen in 1998 on why they kept the name. https:// scholar.lib.vt.e du/vtpubs/ spectrum/ sp980226/3f.html,Wow what a bunch of butthurt racists on this post. Show us on the doll where VT hurt you ‚Äúsnowflakes‚Äù.,I did some research on Barringer::: and found out he was our sixth president::: and a physician who wrote on eugenics. So this would make sense to change the name. Claudius Lee which Lee Hall was named after::: was an 1896 alum and faculty member who brought electrical engineering to Tech::: and installed the first switchboard at the school. He made major contributions to the university. I know the yearbook called him the father of terror::: however::: the university investigated this as far back as 1997 I believe::: and found no actual evidence of what he‚Äôs accused of::: and that it was more likely a distasteful joke amongst his classmates.  Despite this::: Tech has been very progressive since it‚Äôs opening- it allowed women to attend at the turn of the century::: was one of the first military schools to allow women in its Corps of Cadets::: and the first major public university in the South to voluntarily integrate::: which is incredible and awesome considering other states were mobilizing the National Guard to prevent African American students from integrating.  But I do wonder if at some point people are going to demand changing McBride and Lane Halls. Both of those men were Confederate veterans. McBride took Tech from a two year vocational college to a full-fledged university::: making great contributions to Tech::: and Lane was the first commandant. Will their associations prior to becoming faculty force their name removal?,Just to put new racists up?,Wow. Kinda like announcing the arrival of hot air. Lee was proud Virginian.

UPDATE (8/13/20 at 6:18 p.m.): The implementation of any new Cook Counseling fees has been canceled. Read more here: facebook.com/virginiatech/posts/10158762049498054  Cook Counseling Center has a two-fold commitment: to both maintain the current level of care for students and simultaneously manage the escalating costs for all students. In order to respond to current fiscal conditions::: not reduce the number of clinicians::: and not further increase the Health Services Fee::: Cook will be implementing a new fee structure for some services::: effective August 17.  It is important that Cook continue to see as many students as possible and these fees will allow them to do so while impacting as few students as possible. Students with demonstrable financial need can apply for fee waivers and these waivers will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.  More information here: https://vtnews.vt.edu/notices/cook-counseling-fees-aug2020.html  VTNEWS.VT.EDU Update on Cook Counseling fee structure  Virginia Tech August 13::: 2020 at 5:13 PM ¬∑,2020-08-12 18:39:19,UPDATE: The implementation of any new Cook Counseling fees has been canceled. Read more here: facebook.com/ virginiatech/ posts/ 1015876204949805 4,I‚Äôve used Cook Counseling at my worst (hospitalized at a psych ward kind of time) and it has saved me. It‚Äôs a pity to see more barriers being put up rather than torn down üòíüò©,This is very disappointing. Why are we paying the health fee if it‚Äôs not going to cover cook counseling??,Do rising tuition costs not allow for proper mental health support? It‚Äôs a shame that students pay so much::: for so little.,$15 for a psychiatry appointment is ridiculous. The other fees I can see to an extent but this is unacceptable. I'm disappointed.,Regardless of waivers available::: the existence of them all creates a barrier to struggling students. I am disappointed to see the already deficient services move in this direction. Over the years seeing such limited services offered::: continual overcrowding in the university::: and now further limiting support during a global pandemic::: VT is really showing where their priorities are üí∞üí∞üí∞,Please see the comments here and really think about this VT.  - a counselor and 3x Hokie,How do the additional fees make it easier for counselors to see more students Virginia Tech? I‚Äôve noticed twice now that you all make claims without any sort of explanation or evidence to back it up.,Everything about this school has been a disappointment in the past two months. (Excluding their stance on BLM and international students. Don‚Äôt get it twisted.),This is 100% because tech didn‚Äôt allocate enough $ for cook to work with to give students affordable counseling. We ‚ù§Ô∏è you cook counseling::: but VT::: you guys need to do better. Do I need to remind y‚Äôall that we are in the most stressful time of our lives::: more than likely?,What a disappointment. As if there aren‚Äôt enough stigmas against getting help for mental health and now the university is going to charge students to use this resource?? During a pandemic nonetheless and when BIPOC students are going to be the most largely impacted. Come on::: Virginia Tech. You can and must do better.,What financial hardships are Virginia Tech facing that have led to these fees? As a two-time alumni who formerly relied on Cook to support me::: I am very upset to see that VT is adding barriers to students (instead of removing them) who need support in the middle of a global pandemic. Mental health services could not be any more crucial at this time. So disappointing.,Do better::: VT. As an alumna::: your choices are so incredibly disappointing.,This is honestly disgusting. You should be ashamed of yourselves. Why not get the money from President Sands‚Äô salary or maybe Coach Fuente?,As someone who utilized these services in the past::: if they hadn‚Äôt been free::: I couldn‚Äôt have gotten the help I needed. This is disappointing and honestly disgusting.,Wow... I am extremely disappointed in this school recently,So the VT administration asks students to live Ut Prosim to keep the community physically safe during a pandemic but they aren‚Äôt willing to commit to Ut Prosim themselves to protects students mental health? Respect works both ways and anything less than more funding to mental health services from the university is disrespectful.,I'll be blunt::: since most points have been well and eloquently put: getting real sick of your crap VT.  You're turning into a money grab university that I'm not very proud to associate with.,Really disappointed by this.,I‚Äôve utilized Cook multiple times throughout my time at Virginia Tech::: at one point going twice a week for multiple months. I would not have been able to afford the added fees::: as I was already using scholarship and grant money to pay tuition and fees::: as well as working to afford other expenses. Virginia Tech has always valued inclusivity::: community::: and the school motto ‚ÄúUt Prosim.‚Äù I love you Virginia Tech::: but this alongside other expenses and health decisions is really making it difficult to be a proud alumna of VT right now. Please::: I implore you: this is a land-grant::: PUBLIC university. The school will not shut down without these added fees to every student::: but you may lose students to financial difficulties or worse::: mental health issues without the lack of free resources to students.,Virginia Tech needs to realize that students are dependent on the resources the university has. Finding mental health care off campus is extremely hard since VT is in a rural area. Implementing costs for care on campus means a lot of students aren't going to receive the care they need.,A week ago::: Virginia Tech changed the stone entrance to show the new school logo. They have enough money to change a sign during the middle of a pandemic::: but they don‚Äôt have enough money to care about students‚Äô mental health.,Why::: at possibly the worst time in history::: are you limiting mental health services? You are correct::: southwest Virginia doesn‚Äôt have many healthcare professionals. But stop pretending Virginia Tech does not have the funding for it. I am infuriated at this complete lack of care for your students::: faculty::: and staff.,Reminder that the governing authority for Virginia Tech is the Board of Visitors and 13 of the 14 members are appointed by the governor. If you want to see a change make it an issue that gubernatorial candidates must answer to.,I‚Äôm curious: how much of an increase in the student health fee would you need to cover this? It can‚Äôt be that much spread out over 30:::000 students....,Nothing is off limits to VT‚Äôs nickel and dime approach to everything. Won‚Äôt be long before you have to pay a pedestrian toll to cross the drill field.,I‚Äôm glad we have plenty of money to expand football recruiting! Suck the students pockets dry and deprive them of basic services::: the theme of higher education these days. This is absolutely stunning & without a doubt makes it difficult to maintain pride in our school.,‚ÄúMaintain the current level of care‚Äù? Cook‚Äôs current level of care has always been inadequate. Tech won‚Äôt see an alumni donation from me and many others I know until it starts looking after student welfare before it‚Äôs profits.,Given that I was only able to see my therapist once every 8 weeks::: I‚Äôm not sure what you think you‚Äôve been doing with your staffing levels. I gave up and went with a private practice. Demonstrable financial need is utter nonsense when you look at the graduate student population::: few of whom make more than $17K annually but DO NOT apply for financial aid. A better solution is necessary.,Ah yes::: charge students for what were once free (albeit minimal) mental health services in the midst of a pandemic when many families and students have lost their jobs and 41% of college students have reported experiencing symptoms of depression! It‚Äôs incredibly cruel and::: frankly::: immoral to target one of the most crucial resources we have as students during such a vulnerable time when very few people are advocating for college students already. Do you actually believe in Ut Prosim? Do better.,This is a deeply disappointing move::: and there should be more funds allocated towards mental health services instead of continuing to ask students to take care of rising costs. Mental health services at Cook Counseling are already limited and clinicians are already overbooked - a monthly appointment is generally the norm::: which isn't adequate in a high-stress university environment. Adding a further cost::: however minimal::: reduces accessibility to students::: which is harmful considering that many don't realize mental health issues until the stress of university. Especially now::: in this time.  I benefited immensely from being able to go to Cook Counseling::: never having been to any sort of mental health resource before::: and it was life-saving. If there had to be a fee or some sort of monetary record::: I never would have gone.,Especially after considering the history of VT why would you ever put more barriers in the way of assistance for students struggling with their mental health? I find this so disappointing and sort of disgusting. I'm ashamed.,Wait didn't a mental health issue cause Serious catastrophic event . . .and some students won't get help if they can't afford it....maybe not the best plan,As someone who works as a mental health specialist for vulnerable populations::: I‚Äôm embarrassed at my alma mater. Limited access to good mental health services::: not to mention good healthcare in GENERAL::: is one of the number one barriers my clients face::: as most are uninsured and working minimum wage jobs. It saddens me that Virginia Tech has decided that if you can‚Äôt afford mental health treatment::: or if your ‚Äúcase isn‚Äôt worth waiving the fee for:::‚Äù that you can‚Äôt access certain services because of income. If an individual comes to Cook Center because they are experiencing depression but their waiver is denied because their symptoms aren‚Äôt serious enough at that time::: and the student takes their own life::: how do you plan to handle that liability? I‚Äôm ashamed. Allocate your funds. Hire another therapist or two. Finding the money to fund the program should be the school‚Äôs responsibility::: not the students who already pay an arm and a leg to attend.,The Cook Counseling Center has always had trouble getting students appointments when they need them - this is not new. Also::: you do not need to further burden low-income students with signing up for waivers while they are trying to seek services at the CCC. I fear the message this sends to students is to not bother with seeking help at all. We‚Äôre in the middle of a pandemic - help your students!!!,I relied on cook counseling so heavily during my time at Tech. I wouldn‚Äôt have graduated without them. Adding additional fees is going to hurt students. Especially those who may not be eligible for the waivers because their families have money but can‚Äôt go to their families for help with mental health issues.,I wish I knew what it was like to be proud of my school and their decisions. Does any one else happen to know what that is like?,So y'all can pay millions of dollars for a logo redesign::: afford $2:::000-$3:::000 breakfasts each day for athletes::: but can't afford to keep Cook free? This is extremely disappointing.,Honestly this is unacceptable maybe divert some funding from the deans salary and sports and maybe just MAYBE ....actually care about your students wellbeing,This is ridiculous. Students use these services because they don‚Äôt hit their student billing accounts (so they can get help anonymously ‚Äî even from their parents). This is going to keep students from getting the help they need which is really unfortunate. Way to go VT::: completely missing the mark once again. UT PROSIM!,Still waiting on the spirit of ut prosim from our administration. Y‚Äôall just let us know if you ever want to do good for your students again,As a new alum of VT::: many of your decisions in the past few months have been absolutely stunning in the worst way possible. I was never one to rail on the system headed by Tim Sands::: but if VT can't get things together and start making some better decisions geared towards the well-being of its students and their families instead of its accounts; it better be prepared to have negative publicity from its alumni network.,This is so disappointing. Students will now have to pay to get help when they are already struggling. Cook counseling provides students with the ability to get help anonymously which some people prefer. Not to mention other mental health providers in the Blacksburg area refuse to see students that attend Virginia Tech due to their being Cook Counseling on campus. Great job,This is such a disappointment. This also shows how money driven VT is and the amount of concern they truly have for the well-being of students. You may receive your money::: but at what price?,That‚Äôs ridiculous. I tried to get an appointment last year- 3 week wait. Looked at private companies in the area::: all full. The ratio of services offered to students is too low.,I don‚Äôt have any words to express my disappointment in this decision.,Please tell me how JMU::: where I did my undergrad::: is currently able to keep their counseling center free without any extra fees after a certain number of sessions but y'all can't. The number of things I've had to pay for outside of fees has surprised since I started at Tech.,One would think that a school with a mass shooting as part of its history that claimed so many lives would make mental health a number 1 priority. Perhaps take a bit from the precious athletics gold mine? Mental health support should be available and free on all campuses. Stand up and do the right thing::: VT!,so you‚Äôre gonna sit there and tell us ‚Äîwhile Tim Sands gets a raise and now makes $750:::000‚Äîthat you are now going to charge us for something that used to be free AGAIN!? (the first time was the evening parking pass). are you kidding me?,This is extremely disappointing. I utilized Cook throughout my undergrad and it was so helpful. I‚Äôm sad to see that many students will now not have the opportunity to grow in counseling. Coming off of a 5+ month quarantine::: away from friends and social supports::: seems like a terrible time to add another barrier to seeking mental health services. When I worked as an RA::: I referred a countless number of my residents to Cook Counseling. I worry what extra burden this choice to limit health care access places on residence hall student staff::: the office of the dean of students::: etc. I know many of my residents and friends either could not have paid a fee::: or could not have had that line item on their bill for family to see. Unfortunately::: there is still a negative stigma against seeking mental health services. How will Cook plan to protect the privacy of their students? Hopefully in the future::: these funds could be raised in other ways to reduce the load for students.,What about the students who rely on psychiatric services who are already struggling to afford their medication. $15 per session may seem like nothing to some but that‚Äôs the difference of being able to afford medication or not to others. With the rising rates of depression and anxiety this could quite literally become a situation of life or death::: but sure Tim Sands deserves a $200:::000 raise this year.,Y‚Äôall still get TEN FREE appointments. And then after it‚Äôs only $20. Way better than community prices and way better than most other universities. Sadly the need is just so great that free counseling is just not feasible at most places anymore.,"Come on VT::: you can do better than this. Put your money where your mouth is! Mental wellness is of utmost importance and as an alum who has benefitted from cook counseling services and went on to finish my Master's in marriage and family therapy::: I know I wouldn't have been able to afford this fee. While the data you shared is accurate (which you do not cite in the statement)::: mental healthcare is fluid and different for each individual. Counselors deserve their funding and students deserve comprehensive care. I am very disappointed in this change and lack of awareness for how it will affect students. Please consult your Psychology and HDFS faculty about this for further information on how to do better than this. Imagine you connect with a counselor and shared very vulnerable parts of your life with them and built a trusting relationship for them to come back and say::: ""oh::: by the way::: you are on your 11th session so you need to pay $20/visit now."" And having to discontinue services and potentially regress in your symptoms because you can't access your counselor. That's a breeding ground for a whole new issue of ambiguous loss. Obviously the point of counseling is so that a patient/client can be better without the help of a counselor but for some that requires preparation to terminate on THEIR schedule. Some individuals struggle with attachment issues... Only clients and their counselors know when they are ready to terminate.",The fee only goes into effect after the 10 ‚Äúfree‚Äù sessions. Everyone wishes unlimited services could be free::: but this is an incredibly reasonable solution,Looks like VT needs to improve the budgeting committee for better allocating resources that us students REALLY need. VT continues to preach Ut Prosim but hardly does anything to help it‚Äôs own students::: especially during these hard times.,How much money goes to the football program (that's probably going to not end up playing this year)? How much money does Tim Sands make?,What in the world is happening to my alma mater? In a time where mental health support is most needed::: you‚Äôre making it more difficult to access help?? This is shameful::: VT! It‚Äôs becoming difficult to be proud of you lately. I am so deeply disappointed.,This is absolutely disgusting. Sooner or later the community and students will realize this institution is NOTHING but a cash machine.  Reaching into the minds of students that you are ALREADY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF is disgusting. You might as well push them into mental health crisis yourself... oh wait... you already do.  Cook Counseling is already EXTREMELY understaffed::: requiring students to reach out to community resources and spread community counselors even more thin all because of the LACK OF A SHRED OF COMPASSION FROM THE UNIVERSITY. Absolutely gross. Tech is absolutely classless.,If there is any aspect of student health where barriers are not wanted / needed it is this,I utilized Cook throughout my time as an undergrad. Their help was immeasurable::: and I have no doubt I would be in a worse place now if I didn't get help then. I am SO thankful I graduated years ago::: and I am so::: so sorry to all the current and future students who will suffer because the people in charge of the budget don't believe it is needed. As a campus and a community that as gone through major uniquely horrifying events (besides the obvious::: anyone else remember the decapitation of the student in the GLC center::: or the policeman being murdered in the McComas parking lot??)::: Tech should be ashamed of how they are handling mental health access.,First tuition::: then parking::: now this?? Is there ANYTHING ELSE you want to raise the price on? And during these times too? Come on::: Tech::: this is getting ridiculous. You say you care about the well-being of students::: but from everything I‚Äôve been seeing lately::: it does not show. I want to be able to tell prospective students how amazing and wonderful Tech is::: not how Tech is money-hungry to the point of risking students‚Äô mental and physical health. Please listen to our calls and reads the emails we are sending. The students::: parents::: and alumni are NOT with you on this.,Cook counseling saved my life in undergrad. You cant put a price tag on that.,So glad the fees have been reconsidered. Faculty were outraged.,I‚Äôm glad I graduated 2 times from here when I did. Because I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd ever choose to attend tech if I were to be in high school now. You all have become a money-grabbing company rather than the school I knew and loved. I was a first generation college student and these wild fees you have students paying now are outrageous. I am appalled at your lack-luster attempt to ‚Äúmake things easier for all.‚Äù You are a joke and I hope all your new money ploys end in low enrollments. Stay home kids. Go to a community college. VT doesn‚Äôt care about you. Sands/Board of Visitors do you know that Ut Prosim means to serve others??? Not yourself üôÑ,This is what happens when you bring in a radical from the University of California Berkeley to run the show. Sands has no problem accepting that raise at the expense of the student body.,Graduate school is easily the worst decision I've ever made for my mental health.  I sought care at Cook in 2015 and 2017::: and when I needed help with seasonal affective disorder in 2019::: they made me jump through a lot of hoops for access to psychiatric care::: and then refused to let me see a psychiatrist or PMHNP anyway. No help with finding a referral in town::: either.  This continued dereliction is no surprise.  The school is going to have blood on their hands. People suffering from mental illness who do not have access to proper care die.,This is so incredibly disappointing.,Idea. . . Charge less for parking.,So this places the burden on a student to reach out::: hope for an appointment::: then admit they are in distress AND less privileged than their peers? That‚Äôs a lot of bravery for someone in crisis.,Wow. It's wild to me that this news drops three years since the events of Charlottesville . In the months after those events students mobilized and voiced how VT's poor response to handling white supremacy on campus::: including employing a self proclaimed white supremacist who doxxed students::: affected their mental health with some students leaving because they no longer felt safe on campus. That semester I saw students speak about the mental health crisis on campus that had claimed the lives of several students. How the inadequacy of services and overcrowding was forcing students to go off campus for services. I saw admins like Patty Perillo gaslight students who spoke on how they NEEDED to see more because there were lives that depended on it. VT said they would focus specifically on addressing racial justice and how it related to mental health as well as the mental health crisis at the University in general. These were false promises. To limit support which is already inadequate to those who can pay extra::: during a global pandemic at that::: is disgusting. Virginia tech constantly drops money on sports and new unneeded infrastructure::: most workers don't make a living wage yet Sands continued to get a raise::: and now they're nickel and diming mental health services? Shameful.,Booooooo,thats messed up,This is unacceptable. üò°,Very disappointed.,Virginia Tech WOW! üò≥ This new OOS Hokie mom is not impressed. Yet another change that appears to not be in the best interest of the students and is obviously not being well received.,Lmao,Very disappointing!!,So frustrating .,#UtProfit,Karen Best,This is beyond sad and disappointing,Tanisha Tahrin,Megan Atkinson,This is an incredibly disappointing decision. This is a service that was free and now during a pandemic::: when your students need it arguably more than ever::: you decide to monetize off of it. Even with the fee waivers being offered::: it‚Äôs a discouraging process to even have to fill one out. It is just another barrier keeping low-income students from getting the services they need. With all of your recent decisions::: it seems as though Tech has decided that a pandemic is the perfect time to introduce charging for services that used to be ‚Äúfree‚Äù (included in tuition). With all of the money that your students give you and you get from donations::: you can afford to give YOUR students helpful services for ‚Äúfree‚Äù.,Absolutely pathetic::: and embarrassing to put out. You expect those struggling with mental health to add another stressor or seeing if they qualify for a financial waiver? I‚Äôd say do better::: but after setting the bar so low it‚Äôs hard to go anywhere but up.,Are y‚Äôall just trying to see how far you can push students until they transfer or what? These recent decisions have just been baffling. This is a huge disappointment and a disservice to vulnerable students whose only mental health resource is Cook. Student organizations and clubs show far better leadership and empathy than this university‚Äôs administration.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In response to requests from the community::: Virginia Tech Parking Services is now offering a new Evening Only (EO) parking permit that will provide all Hokies the opportunity to park on campus during evenings (5 ‚Äì 10 p.m. only).  The EO permit is currently not available for sale online::: but can be purchased in-person at VT Parking Services (505 Beamer Way) for $100 annually or $50 per semester.  As of today (Aug. 3)::: everyone will need to display a permit or pay a daily fee to park on the Blacksburg campus from 7 a.m.-10 p.m.::: Monday-Friday. F/S and GS permits are on sale now. Perry Street Student Commuter permits will go on sale Aug. 7 and all other student permits go on sale Aug. 10. ‚¨áÔ∏è  VTNEWS.VT.EDU University community members on the Blacksburg campus will need to pay to park beginning Monday::: Aug. 3,2020-08-03 16:53:49,This will seriously hinder organizations which meet on campus.,I really thought this was an alumni author from The Onion.,Used to be free now forcing people to pay $100 during a pandemic.

VT wants to squeeze every penny they can out of you.,Glad I graduated when I did,I‚Äôm local and while it doesn‚Äôt directly impact me currently::: it would have in the past. It seems like a relatively minimal amount of potential income for a lot of damage to town/ university relations. It‚Äôs a shame and disappointing.,Ut Prosim- ‚ÄúThat I may serve‚Äù  Sigh! those days where we are spoon fed saying ‚Äúby popular demand::: after 5pm parking is back but with fees this year‚Äù! unfortunately parking has become more of a necessity/ right during these difficult times for students when public buses can never be 100% safe even during off peak hours. I have been involved and attended so many forums and town halls and one of the top agenda for most of them was ‚Äúbringing parking services back to normal operations‚Äù- however::: that is not how the requests was expected to be fulfilled...,It's a lie. No one from the community requested for this.,Are there any areas at campus where parents can park for free after their move-in time is over. I know we are supposed to head right out of town but just in case,Lol::: park to park::: virus is free of course...goto a football game end up in icu,How about students who have permits for a specific lot away from the main part of campus?

This includes music lessons::: sport lessons::: community outdoor yoga::: group therapy::: the list goes on.

Think about how much it is just to re-coat your driveway. Don't forget the cost of the parking garages::: signs::: lights::: and people to enforce the rules::: so you actually have a place to park. Parking Services is self-funded::: meaning they do not get money from the state::: nor from tuition. They will be losing a lot of money from fewer events on campus.

Virginia Tech Athletics' statement on today‚Äôs Atlantic Coast Conference decision regarding fall sports. ‚¨áÔ∏è  Virginia Tech Athletics July 29::: 2020 at 4:24 PM ¬∑  ACC Announces Plans for Football and Fall Olympic Sports  Read: vthoki.es/J0bNt,2020-07-29 22:01:17,As much as I love Hokie football and thoroughly enjoyed going to games as a student and grad student::: I really hope that College football is cancelled altogether. Look at MLB and NBA-even with major precautions and arguably more resources than college athletics::: teams are contracting virus. I also worry because the 20 year old version of me would have totally ignored many of the precautions to pack into center street or Chicken Hill Lot just to tailgate on a crisp Blacksburg Fall Saturday. It's really sad and sucks big time::: but the sooner everyone gets their act together::: the sooner the risk of virus declines and sitting one out in hopes of a perfect::: back-to-normal 2021 season sounds like a tenable option at this time.,After 25 years of having season tickets::: my wife and I are going to have to pass on this year. It's just too dangerous for senior citizens.,I don't see how they are even thinking of allowing season ticket holders to come to Blacksburg when they have told parents not to come to Blacksburg this Fall & that students should not leave campus to return home. They are trying to contain Covid exposure So disappointing that again $$$$ speaks.

The rest of us can watch from our couches.,Not a good idea : unless you isolate them from family:::friends and other students 24hours a day 7day a week for the season,Kayla Rojas üôÉüôÉ,Can't leave all those millions of TV contract money on the table.,What I don‚Äôt understand is all of the arguments- if you disagree- don‚Äôt go. Everyone has an opinion and there is no answer that will make everyone happy. Life is nothing but risks- driving::: eating::: even having sex. I find it interesting that some risk are okay while others are not. The quarantine was put in place to hopefully reduce volumes so that the medical system could handle the patient load::: not to prevent people from getting COVID. I don‚Äôt want anyone to get COVID or anything else for that matter. But really don‚Äôt understand how unless a decision is exactly how each person believe it should be::: that anyone can do anything right.. and with so many differing opinions that is impossible. Best approach is to do the best we can.,Why don‚Äôt they just call it! Sept 1st isn‚Äôt going to happen.,What does 10+1 model mean?,Quite the experiment you all are undertaking.,As a season ticket holder::: I would love to be in the 'Burg for games this Fall::: but that will not be happening. VT needs to really restrict the # of fans::: if any at all. Given the covid trends in Southwest VA per the VA Health Dept::: it will only get worse if we load up the town on football weekends. Tech is an outstanding S&T school and should show their leadership by following the science.,Do season ticket holders have the option to defer their tickets until 2021?,Doug Stiglich,So we are a go for football and crowds but to have in class education is just too risky. VT and ACC is out for the money grab. They claim it‚Äôs for your safety but that is obviously just a lie. Or for those conspiracy theorist - You wonder why people call this COVID situation a political hit job - well stop making conflicting decisions like this. Open up the classroom and educate our youth - I love football but education should drive the most aggressive decisions not football. Another hypocritical decision. But I guess we should not question such obvious conflicts just shut up and do as they say. Long live the queen.,Katie Morgan::: Ryan Morganüò¨,Just put it on tv::: so the kids can spread out!,I just hope the non-conference just gets pushed back to next year. It would be a real shame to lose the Penn State game.,Athletes and all those in close proximity need to be safe.

Or no fans::: or what?,I know VT is approaching this issue with very thoughtful consideration. I would hate to see students suffer. We unfortunately do not have a vaccine or working treatment.,This is going to be a disaster,No Virginia high school football until March 1::: perhaps colleges should take note. Completely understand players who decide to sit out during the fall.,If we can have football games::: then we can have in person classes.,I have a cadet. I certainly don‚Äôt want him in the stands ! With the chance of getting covid. From all the yelling and screaming. Even with a face mask!,And you expect drunk students to social distance in the stadium? And what about the students who want to play so bad they ignore possible symptoms of COVID-19::: infecting their teammates and opponents? What about the elderly donors::: coaches::: and family members who are considered ‚Äúat risk‚Äù who will attend these games? The only reason Virginia Tech didn‚Äôt make school entirely online this semester was to preserve the athletic season for money and it‚Äôs honestly so disappointing. Believe me::: I LOVE football season as much as any college student::: but losing it this fall was a sacrifice I was willing to make FOR THE SAFETY OF ALL HOKIES! I hope you plan to refund my season tickets because I will not be putting myself or others at risk. Is this where Ut Prosim ends for you?,It's possible to have higher standards and put safety first.

Virginia Tech‚Äôs fall 2020 testing::: tracing::: and case management plan has been expanded with more information on how the university is enhancing testing protocols for students.  Please see the story and our post comments below for more details. ‚¨áÔ∏è  VTNEWS.VT.EDU Virginia Tech outlines expanded plan for student testing,2020-07-28 23:41:32,Students are encouraged to be tested before traveling to Town of Blacksburg Government::: so that students and their families have an opportunity to evaluate their plans and make adjustments if a positive result is returned. Students should submit their test results to the Schiffert Health Center as part of their health records.,Prior to returning to Town of Blacksburg Government::: all students are expected to self-quarantine for 14 days::: wear face coverings when with others and follow all public health guidelines. Anyone who is traveling and is at-risk should self-quarantine and be tested if they develop COVID-19 symptoms.,Testing is not required for students living off campus::: but it is required for at-risk off-campus students. These students should contact Schiffert Health Center to determine whether they should be tested.,Testing through Schiffert Health Center during move-in (from Aug. 14-23) is required for on-campus students even if they have secured a negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) COVID-19 test result prior to traveling to Town of Blacksburg Government.,On-campus students who test positive for the virus::: or who have been potentially exposed to COVID-19 as determined by health care professionals::: will be asked to return to their permanent address and quarantine for 14 days. Students who cannot do so should contact the Dean of Students Office.,Results of tests conducted by Schiffert Health Center should be available within 48 hours. All students who are tested are expected to self-quarantine until results are returned.,Fralin Biomedical Research Institute's testing lab will be able to scale and meet the COVID-19 testing needs for Hokies::: allowing for a rapid return of results as the pace of testing quickens at the beginning of the semester. They are processing 2:::500 samples per week and plan to scale to 5:::000+ per week.,Why even bother...all of these complications.. .just do it all on line much simpler and safer...could catch coronavirus while waiting in line to be tested...,There is some uncertainty with test results and it would be a shame to send a student home for 14 days if the positive test is actually not accurate. Could there be an option for a quick retest or other alternative if the student does not have symptoms?,Is there compensation for having to leave dorm? I understand things are changing. But we were under impression students would quarantine on campus. After driving in car for six hours with a positive person. We will then have to quarantine also.,Jen Ehrhardt,"My suggestion is that you equip all students::: faculty::: and staff with body cams::: to be worn 24 hours per day::: and require cameras in all rooms of all buildings in Blacksburg to monitor your experiment::: augmented with facial recognition software. Or are you just going to ""chip"" everyone in town? Otherwise your ""contact tracing"" process is ripe with flaws. I would expect lawsuits from those who are unduly excised from the university community. Since the underlying premise is not based in science::: but theory::: I'm expecting the university to publish numerous papers on the success of this project::: while ignoring the students hurt by this approach.",Seems like this is a good time for kids to take a gap year,Finally taking some action! Good job Tech ‚ù§Ô∏è,Since the school has decided to go ahead with the on campus option::: it is important to have testing for students. But the key is how fast the results are made available and strong contact tracing to follow it up. Timing is the essence and will determine how effective these protocols will be. My hope is that there is good planning in place and clear guidelines for students to follow. Praying for the safety of our Hokies!,I‚Äôm confused... I was initially told testing couldn‚Äôt be mandated. Now it is for on campus students... is that correct?,Niaya Jackson,many students are working these next few weeks before they go to BB for move in. How can they quarantine?,Tough part for our son::: is we are 12 hours away,Following,And still not going to offer all in class education. Should offer both. But you can have 100% online and still must live on campus. Sad decisions and the dumbing down of students at all grade levels. You can do better VT.,How do people with roommates limit the spread when awaiting results? How do you limit the spread in dorms with shared bathrooms and showers? Also when the results come back if one roommate is negative but the other is positive then sending them back home would cause the virus to spread to their families and communities (who may be more at risk).,We are taking our young adult to be tested two weeks before she comes for her safety. And anyone else.,Will positive cases associated with VT students on or off campus be associated with the Montgomery County VDH metrics or will there be another dashboard that will be used for VT?,I‚Äôve been very supportive of VT‚Äôs efforts but this doesn‚Äôt make sense to me. We are only 2 weeks away from move in. I‚Äôm not against testing however testing only on campus students is not logical. I‚Äôm relatively local... if I need to pick my child/children up I can but that is not the case for everyone. You want parents to rush off campus after a 2 hour move in window but want our kids quarantined for 48 hours and then if positive to go home. I have one on campus and one off campus. They will interact with one another.,Tanisha Tahrin have you read this?,How do you ensure that students actually self quarantine for 2 weeks?,And if students refuse such an invasive test::: they just drop out or transfer::: correct? Absolutely no choice but to leave?,What if you work?,What is the procedure for off campus students who want to be tested at Schiffert? Can that be done before the on campus move-in dates?,President Sands said that VT would develop a dashboard UNC starts classes August 10 - this is a great example of a daashboard! https:// carolinatogether .unc.edu/ dashboard/,My understanding is that test through Schiffert Health Center are currently taking 72 hours. Concerned because campus isn‚Äôt anywhere near regular capacity at this point. Is staffing and testing capacity increasing significantly to handle expected surge in demand before most of the student body returns?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

See below for updates on Blacksburg Transit's plan for the fall and health measures being implemented. More to come::: but it is expected that ridership demand can be reasonably and safely accommodated.  üöç On 8/9::: BT will implement new passenger limits ‚Äî set at approximately two-thirds of capacity for large buses (an articulated bus will have a limit of 75 passengers and a regular-sized bus will have a limit of 45-55). üöç Passengers and drivers will be required to wear masks. üöç Thorough cleaning and disinfecting of buses. üöç Even though there will not be six feet of physical distancing at all times::: BT's average trip length is 10 minutes. (According to the CDC::: transmission is unlikely in brief interactions of less than 15 minutes::: even in close proximity.) üöç Barriers will be installed to provide a separation between the driver and passengers. üöç They will add an additional route on South Main St. and extend service on the CRC route. They will also provide fill-in buses to assist when there are full buses.  Blacksburg Transit July 23::: 2020 at 8:49 AM ¬∑  In preparation for the start of the fall semester::: BT will implement adjusted passenger limits effective Sunday::: August 9. These new limits will be set at approximately 2/3 capacity for large buses and 1/3 capacity for smaller buses.  These measures have been reviewed by the New River Health Department and are subject to change based on the rate of COVID-19 cases locally::: Governor‚Äôs Executive Orders::: or decisions by Virginia Tech that affect the demand for public transportation.

VT should place the importance of public health (students and community) above the financial needs of the university and continue distance learning until a vaccine is available.,Fantastic message.,Good luck with that. Not all your alums are doing what they should with masks from my experience encountering them in Richmond.,The message is on point. VT can‚Äôt win- parents are either demanding 100% in person instruction or 100% online in about equal numbers based on Parent page. Can‚Äôt have it both ways.

We recognize that the workplace and classrooms will look different in the fall. While balancing the requirement for VT Parking Services to be fully-self funded::: we will strive to offer a range of parking options that are equitable::: flexible::: and convenient that meet our university community‚Äôs needs.  This includes the sale of numerous types of parking permits and some planned changes and new technologies that will help enhance the flexibility of parking offerings::: including hourly and daily parking options.

Is it because many students are taking a gap year & the bottom line of the university is hurting? Parking has not been an issue after 5p in the past. Since there is not enough on campus housing for students after freshman year::: approximately 18:::000+ students live off campus. Is this the way to restrict use of the gym & library in the evenings? Is BT increased capacity on the buses? The BT site still says 9 persons per bus! How are students to get to campus for their in person classes? VT decided to make a huge unnecessary problem. This is not UT Prosim in helping the off campus undergrads & graduates. Please reconsider.,More students in Blacksburg living off campus = more commuters and more parking passes period...and more infractions. There was no need to change further structure. I do NOT support this is any way.,This is truly a dangerous change. With the hours extended::: students will be forced to use public transportation::: thereby furthering their potential to contract the virus. We already pay for on campus resources::: I shouldn't ALSO have to sacrifice my health (or potentially my life) to be able to get to them.,It‚Äôs because of all that money they gave back last semester for Rona... best believe they gonna try and rape to get it back!,Virginia Tech- will you please update us on the fall plan for Blacksburg Transit schedules and number of passengers?,Pure greed. Some employees have not used their parking passes since mid-march due to the pandemic but no refund was offered.,Global pandemic....Peo ple lost their livelihood... Students are trying to stay in school to hopefully enter a workforce in the near future... Yet... I see OOS tuition on the rise - again And now this. Usually I just scroll on posts I don‚Äôt agree with - But with my daughter (CAUS) enrolled FT in the summer and now planning for the Fall who spends countless hours in studio - just to have one more rising cost - I‚Äôm at a loss Shame on you VT.... shame on you.,We already pay a lot for tuition the least ya‚Äôll can do is give us free parking even more than ever since corona nobody be wanting to take those buses,Shu Shu Nana.....üòÇüòÇ,So what are us student employees who need to drive to work in the evenings supposed to do? We already work long hours to make money to pay for our education and living expenses. Am I supposed to pay $350 I wouldn‚Äôt have to otherwise pay just to get to my job? Busses only run so often after 10pm and we usually don‚Äôt get off until after 11. Am I supposed to wait alone at a bus stop at 11pm for almost an hour to wait for another bus that can only carry 10 people with COVID-19 precautions in place?? Do better::: Virginia Tech.,Ugh - Hoping you re-think this. So many people suffering economic hardships and this will just add additional stress,Here's a thought::: how about for starters you do something to curb the monthly amount of Virginia Tech's electricity bill which on average is around 2.3 million dollars... Or over enrollment which creates a housing crisis... Perhaps don't encourage a system that encourages individual departments to spend large amounts of money at the end of the fiscal year on unneeded items out of concern of having their budget cut the next year? How about applauding saving money instead?? If you can't restore the after hours parking privileges that benefit students::: and locals let's look at some other options... Since the bottom line is all that matters.. maybe drain the Duck Pond::: fill it in and make it a parking lot? Maybe put some parking spaces on top of War memorial Chapel? Let's not forget all of that grass on the Drillfield.. that would be some great parking!,In what way is this MORE flexible?,As a student who has frequent meetings on campus in the evenings for classes that I am paying for and club/ organization meetings to better the VT community::: I urge you to find better::: unbiased options,care about your students!!!!,Does this enforcement (5-10PM) apply to every parking spot on campus::: or just to F/S spots?,Just admit you are trying to milk vulnerable students for as much as you can get. Don't even pretend this is convenient or flexible for anyone but those seeing the extra ticketing money and parking pass money in their paychecks. Virginia Tech::: I am disgusted and disappointed that this is how you choose to treat your students::: faculty::: and staff during a global pandemic and economic crisis.,Please explain how forcing students to use public transportation is being responsible. Parking should be more accessible::: less costly and encouraged. Maybe a discount for students to share a ride with their room mates. You do t have enough on campus housing for ALL students so you need to provide a safe way for students to get on campus. Public transportation is usually good in b‚Äôburg::: but this year driving to campus needs to be ENCOURAGED!!!,Does that mean she can‚Äôt go back,Jared Webb,I'm sorry::: but I fail to see how this is flexible or convenient for students::: especially with BT restrictions,Ridiculous::: fueled by nothing but greed.,What a joke. Way to make parking more difficult for people... faculty/staff and students alike.

No?,Fyi... my son goes to GA Tech and the parking pass is $800 per year.,I see the prices are the exact same as last year::: now how does that make sense? There‚Äôs a lot more remote learning (aka online-at home) so why are the prices not reduced?????,This is also crappy for professors::: staff::: and dining workers.

The rate also remains the same as last year::: and no parking after 5pm does not add to any flexibility for students (unfortunately) . Believe me::: 5pm- 10pm is the time which graduate students add value to the campus and the university.

Academic instruction plans for fall 2020 gives students a range of tools to customize their schedules and supports faculty in building the best academic experience possible in an extraordinarily uncertain environment.  ‚û°Ô∏è Drop/Add is open for students starting 6 p.m. today. Students will have an expanded window of time to adjust their classes::: with the expanded site including new information about the modality of the classes.  ‚û°Ô∏è In HokieSPA::: students will see one of four course modalities: online asynchronous (no set meeting days or times); online with synchronous meetings (meet at assigned days and times); hybrid (face-to-face and online); and face-to-face.  ‚û°Ô∏è While modalities are listed on most courses::: they will not show up on the majority of independent study::: undergraduate research::: research credits::: and other administrative courses. More information on modalities can be found at the registrar‚Äôs site: www.registrar.vt.edu/fall_course_modalities  VTNEWS.VT.EDU Virginia Tech provides students with course delivery::: registration info for fall semester,2020-07-13 12:33:27,Is there a plan to quarantine students upon arrival in the fall? I guessing students will be arriving from all over the US::: including from states currently considered COVID hotspots. How will this be managed?,My incoming freshman has 3 on line on including a lab and 2 classes in person one being a llc course. Are all online classes set or is there a chance more classes will be offered in person?,I‚Äôm very concerned as we are out of state and paying full tuition for 5 online classes. As my son is off campus::: the other benefits/perks of college: dining halls::: recreation::: sports are not available so the price seems to be TOO much. Gladly pay for excellent instruction but am very concerned.,Hoping my daughters classes (which are ALL online) at least require set meeting days/times - spring remote learning was not what I paid for all PowerPoint lectures sent to her. üò°,Daniel Rico,I'm a VT alum::: former employee::: current educational technology professional AND college student parent - and its SO much more costly to create a campus with these constraints than it is for any other year. I am guessing there is NO money to spare::: refund or return and in fact that departments are taking financial cuts so that the university can afford to buy all the covid supplies and pay the staff to work crazy hours to set everything up to make this all happen. To run online classes effectively its costly and time consuming - MUCH moreso than teaching in the classroom. So you may question a line item under student activities where as it may end up being cross funded to facilities which your student will use. With an operation as large at VT I would safely assume that every T has been crossed and every i has been dotted because they have so many people to be accountable to and accountable for. GO HOKIES!,Is it open for Freshmen who had not yet have their Orientation?,My daughter::: an upcoming Senior::: had online learning after Spring break this year. The professors did an amazing job. She participated in breakout rooms over Zoom and felt it was very engaging. They all made it work.  Most of her classes will be online this school year but will have one in-class lab. It is not how she envisioned her Senior year but she values the education she is receiving from the faculty. She is healthy and she will earn her degree in BioChemistry. Virginia Tech is doing the best they can during this difficult time.  I applaud all they have done. Fingers crossed Spring semester looks more ‚Äúnormal‚Äù.,Hoping you will do the right thing and reconsider fees for things students will not have access to::: like gyms and transportation. A precedence has already been set at other schools. The students will go to court and win::: and the negative press VT will receive will not be good for the University. Do the right thing VT and don‚Äôt try to charge for things you can‚Äôt actually provide!,Hey PARENTS of current Hokies: chill out. You're an embarrassment to your child. Let them ask these valid questions you're raising and provide the feedback affecting their learning & college experience. Yes it may be your money paying for tuition::: but airing your grievances on Virginia Tech's Facebook about covid related learning situation is sad.

More details on the app and training program to come by Aug. 3.,Students will be asked to self-quarantine and wear a face covering for 14 days before arriving on campus. Students are strongly encouraged to secure a negative PCR COVID-19 test result within 5 days prior to returning to the area. Those who test positive will be required to self-isolate before returning to a VT facility or location.,On-campus students can be tested by Schiffert Health Center upon their arrival on campus during move-in. These students signed the Virginia Tech Housing & Residence Life COVID-19 Health and Well-being Commitment as part of their contract and will be expected to abide by these expectations. See more on that commitment here: https:// housing.vt.edu/ content/dam/ housing_vt_edu/ assets/doc/ Residential_Life _Health_and_Wel lbeing_Commitme nt.pdf,Students and employees identified by VT as testing positive for COVID-19 will be reported to the Virginia Department of Health::: in accordance with the Code of Virginia. To ensure individual privacy::: individuals who test positive will not be publicly identified. Individuals who have tested positive::: are presumed positive::: or are identified by a public health professional or health care provider as a close contact::: should self-disclose to VT‚Äôs Case Management Team to contain the spread and provide additional support if necessary. Self-disclosure protocol details to come from this team.,Students who test positive for COVID-19 should inform the Dean of Students Office (540-231-3787 or dean.students@v t.edu) and they will provide ongoing support for each student.

They should also report known university contacts and work locations to VT‚Äôs Case Management Team.,What about students who have been staying in Blacksburg::: the entire summer?

Please remember::: VT and Blacksburg may be struggling financially due to Covid 19::: but so are the students and their parents::: whose jobs were reduced or eliminated. If you must open::: PLEASE re-organize your operations and take further::: even more unprecedented measures. -\-\- If you must open::: could students with lecture-only classes opt out of their housing contracts and take online classes from home? Doing so would free up dorm space for distancing. If you must open::: could students opt out of your mandatory meal plans so that they can keep themselves more safe and handle their own food?

Here's a closer look at what changes the fall semester will bring to Virginia Tech Dining Services. We are working to prioritize student and staff health as we navigate our plans::: with sanitation and safety as the guiding principles.  ‚û°Ô∏è Tables will be spaced nine feet apart to provide for six feet of physical distancing between people seated at different tables. Each table will be limited to four people and there will be reduced capacity in the buildings.  ‚û°Ô∏è Students in line must also observe physical distancing. We have installed ‚Äúmiles of plexiglass‚Äù to protect workers and those in serving lines. Hand sanitizer will be available at the entrance and throughout each building.  ‚û°Ô∏è We have installed touchless payment systems and self-service stations such as salad bars have been eliminated. Menus will be reduced::: but popular items such as chicken parmesan::: General Tso‚Äôs chicken::: and London broil will still be available.  ‚û°Ô∏è We are working closely with the Town of Blacksburg Government and area restaurants to make more options available to those without dining plans. We will also be increasing the number of food truck providers::: providing more ‚ÄúGrab-n-Gobble‚Äù options::: and expanding the number of Grubhub kiosks on campus.  ‚¨áÔ∏è Read more ‚¨áÔ∏è  VTNEWS.VT.EDU Changes coming to campus dining in fall 2020,2020-06-30 19:19:33,Camille Gipson Lexi Kite keep calm and find ur table.,Will face masks be required while they are in line?

We remember them.,2021-11-18 09:09:59,Here,I remember that day..my daughter was 5 and knew from a very young age she would be an Aggie ❤️ class of 2016... We'll never forget ❤️🙏,I remember getting that early morning phone call and hearing “ Mom….Something bad happened but I’m ok! I’m safe!” 😢💔🙏🏻 My son had been working on the bonfire earlier that evening and his buddies decided to go eat and go back to the dorm only hours before tragedy hit! I thank God every day for sparing my child and at the same time my heart breaks for those parents that didn’t get that phone call..”Mom::: I’m safe! “,"We remember!!
Here
I was a fortunate
Mom ‘05
who received calls from my son ‘99 and my daughter ‘00
We are safe!!!
Prayers for all the wounded and Aggies we lost.",I still remember that day like it was yesterday. I was in labor watching this on the news. My son was born at 2:41 pm that same day. He is 22 today.,I remember that tragic morning. A memory that will remain forever. HERE.,I'm a Longhorn here::: deepest condolences. This was bigger than the rivalry::: it was the tragedy. We'll never forget either. Thoughts be with you.,"Here

My Aggie wasn't yet born when this happened::: but as a parent it tears at my heart that other parents endured that tragedy.",I'm an Aggie parent::: and saw the memorial recently. Was so moved by the story::: the honor the memorial conveys::: and the deep thoughtfulness behind the design. Remembering today...,"I’ll never forget waking up to the news. I dressed my one-year old daughter and I couldn’t get to College Station fast enough.
To this day it’s hard to comprehend that what I was witnessing in front of me was reality.
We attended the game vs texas and there wasn’t a dry eye at Kyle Field that day. I held my daughter tightly in my arms throughout the game all the while knowing there were Aggie Parents whose babies were never coming home. As I stood in the stands my heart was heavy for those students::: their parents and loved ones::: and our entire Aggie Family. I remember them today and all
of the courageous people who rushed in to help.
My daughter who was in my arms as I watched the bonfire recovery effort and stood through the game is now Class of 2020 and my youngest is Class of 2025.
I will remember our twelve always. Their spirit lives on.
HERE!",I remember & will never forget - I was on campus all day holding & hugging my daughter’s dormmates. (Her dorm was on stack that night. My daughter was supposed to be on stack as well::: but was sick and couldn’t work - thank God.). HERE. 🙏🏻,"I was at Bonfire the night it fell.

My two dogs had been missing for days::: a neighbor suggested I look there. My sister and I watched these able-bodied boys pull out the next log for the stack::: backlit by lights that would haunt me for decades.

I was less than a month away from becoming a certified EMT. I had been up late every night that week::: and I went home because I was tired. It took a really::: really long time to accept the fact that God did not want me to stay there those extra 20 minutes…

God bless these kids and their families. They were way better Aggies than I ever was::: and their loss doesn’t get any easier.","I woke up to that on the news and was in shock. It did not get any better. I was teaching high school. I gave the students a work on your own assignment and did not worry about whether they were doing it.

I had passed the growing stacks for years attending the Aggie games::: even attending the TCU game every other year when it was huge and ready to light later in the week. All day that day I was just shaking imagining how terrified those trapped must feel. Then I saw the close up picture of I think the last trapped student rescued. I dreamed about it all night.",I was there during the summer. I visited this place.. so humbled to have been able to pay respect 🙏,My son was on the stack till midnight. Got a phone call from both my boys early in the morning telling me they were ok. At the time I didn’t even know what had happened. They told me and my heart broke. HERE,RIP Chris Heard. I will never forget you! 💕 Spending nights on the phone listening to music as middle schoolers. The Cranberries - Linger- always makes me think of you.,This is one of the reasons I love this school.,My brother was there...He was 20 at the time...He wasn't hurt during it,My daughter::: who was a senior in high school::: shouted down to me from upstairs to turn on the news. My nephew had been working on the stack. The time it took to verify he was safe was stressful. HERE,Our son graduated in January::: 1999. Of course we heard the tragic news. We had lived in Ohio::: moved here in 2018. Last year we visited the campus & saw the memorial. It is a serene place. There is a compass in the the middle & it points in the direction of the students' home towns. God Bless his Children::: their families & friends.,"Like 👍 = Gig ‘em
Determination::: optimism::: loyalty and Texas Aggie Spirit. It was in all those guys.",I remember that day so clearly. Was such a tragic & sad day,A very hard day for me. Here.,I’m Not an American but here,Such a sad time::: God bless the family’s,Such a tragedy 😥,Was so tragic::: very sad day in Aggieland!,This day will forever be etched in my mind & heart.☹️❤️❤️,That was an awesome experience at the memorial,"Eternal rest grant unto them::: O Lord:::
and let perpetual light shine upon them.
May they rest in peace. Amen.",Prayers for their families,Praying for the families as they remember today.,Here::: never forget the phone call and classes being cancelled.,Remember - Never forget - Loved Aggies ❤🙏👍❤,I remember,I remember that day like it was yesterday. As it fell::: the vibration woke me up::: and I heard the sirens and helicopters hour after hour.,"2018 Aggie parents. Paid our respects to these brave souls and gave them honor. A moving and solemn visit without a dry eye. Rest In Peace Angels and deep and sincere condolences to their families and friends.

Luke 10:25-37

There was a scholar of the law who stood up to test Jesus and said:::
""Teacher::: what must I do to inherit eternal life?""
Jesus said to him::: ""What is written in the law?
How do you read it?""
He said in reply:::
""You shall love the Lord::: your God:::
with all your heart:::
with all your being:::
with all your strength:::
and with all your mind:::
and your neighbor as yourself.""
He replied to him::: ""You have answered correctly;
do this and you will live.""

But because he wished to justify himself::: he said to Jesus:::
""And who is my neighbor?""
Jesus replied:::
""A man fell victim to robbers
as he went down from Jerusalem to Jericho.
They stripped and beat him and went off leaving him half-dead.
A priest happened to be going down that road:::
but when he saw him::: he passed by on the opposite side.
Likewise a Levite came to the place:::
and when he saw him::: he passed by on the opposite side.
But a Samaritan traveler who came upon him
was moved with compassion at the sight.
He approached the victim:::
poured oil and wine over his wounds and bandaged them.
Then he lifted him up on his own animal:::
took him to an inn::: and cared for him.
The next day he took out two silver coins
and gave them to the innkeeper with the instruction:::
'Take care of him.
If you spend more than what I have given you:::
I shall repay you on my way back.'
Which of these three::: in your opinion:::
was neighbor to the robbers' victim?""
He answered::: ""The one who treated him with mercy.""
Jesus said to him::: ""Go and do likewise.""",Elephant Walk was one of my favorite memories from my A&M days.,"Gospel

Mt 5:17-19

Jesus said to his disciples:
“Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets.
I have come not to abolish but to fulfill.
Amen::: I say to you::: until heaven and earth pass away:::
not the smallest letter or the smallest part of a letter
will pass from the law:::
until all things have taken place.
Therefore::: whoever breaks one of the least of these commandments
and teaches others to do so
will be called least in the Kingdom of heaven.
But whoever obeys and teaches these commandments
will be called greatest in the Kingdom of heaven.”","Are you wondering in the scorching desert of heart::: soul and mind?

Jesus said::: whoever comes to me will never hunger and whoever believes in me will never thirst.

I am the bread of life.

I am the light of the world.

I am the resurrection.

Know therefore that the Lord your God is God::: the faithful God who keeps covenant and steadfast love with those who love him and keep his commandments::: to a thousand generations.

Deuteronomy 7:9

We possess the prophetic message as something altogether reliable. Keep your attention closely fixed on it::: as you would on a lamp shining in a dark place until the first streaks of dawn appear and the morning star rises in your hearts. First you must understand this: their is no prophesy contained in Scripture which is a personal interpretation.
Prophecy has never been put forward by man's willing it. It is rather that men impelled by the Holy Spirit have spoken under God's influence.

Happy National Pumpkin Day from Aggieland!,2021-10-26 14:19:45,"Five years ago today::: a light-blond golden retriever was born in Texas A&M University’s canine muscular dystrophy laboratory.
Workers named her Elvira—and the nightmare that she’s endured for the last five years is as depraved as any horror movie.
Experimenters bred her to develop a canine form of muscular dystrophy. Not content to release her after she failed to show symptoms of the debilitating disease::: they instead treated her as nothing more than a breeding machine::: forcing her to give birth to litter after litter of puppies—each one condemned to suffer in crude experiments as their muscles slowly wasted away. Then experimenters transferred Elvira to the veterinary school to be used in teaching labs.Elvira has never known a real home and the love of a family that every dog deserves—and today::: she’s spending her fifth birthday locked in a laboratory cage.",Please release Cannoli::: now called Kahlua::: along with the other eight healthy dogs sent to the veterinary school from the canine muscular dystrophy laboratory.The muscular dystrophy lab said that all dogs it no longer wanted would be made available for adoption. Why haven’t these dogs been allowed to go to homes?These dogs deserve a chance to live with families in real homes.,Please allow the remaining dogs in the canine muscular dystrophy laboratory to be adopted. They've done their job and deserve to spend the rest of their years in a loving home. Please consider their release.,Beautiful,Love Aggie Land,That’s a little too much orange in Aggieland for my tastes.,Love pumpkins 🎃 and fall especially from Aggies,Whoop!,Madison Stokes If it’s national pumpkin day… does that mean we have to go get pumpkins? 👻,😊,"Release Cannoli/Kahlua and all the remaining dogs into good homes

Great game Aggies!!!",It was the best game! Whoop!,That was a thrilling game!!,They all have the same expression on their faces!,It really happened::: so happy for them!!!!,"Dear Dr. Banks:

Right now::: 19 dogs from Texas A&M University’s canine muscular dystrophy (MD) laboratory—12 of whom are perfectly healthy and adoptable—conti
nue to be warehoused on your campus::: despite the retirement of the lead experimenter and the fact that the lab appears to have little funding for experiments.

The golden retrievers and other dogs from this laboratory are deprived of the very things that would make their lives worth living::: as they spend every day stuck in barren metal cells. The dogs suffering from canine MD have undergone painful and terrifying testing::: and their health has steadily deteriorated to the point where it’s difficult for them even to swallow their own saliva. Video footage shows that the healthy ones pace frantically and bite at the bars of their cages in frustration.

It’s commendable that Texas A&M made the compassionate decision to stop breeding dogs to develop MD in 2019. Please do the next right thing and use your authority as president to order the release of the surviving dogs so that they may spend their remaining years in warm::: loving adoptive homes.

Thank you for your consideration of this important matter.",Gig’em Aggies! Way to go!!!,Absolutely unreal - what a fantastic game,Gig’Em Aggies! 💕,It’s true!!!!!!,I was nervous the whole game::: wanting that win and the Aggies came through in a big way.

I do not like Jimbutt after his reputation of destroying a team before leaving them (ask FSU and his disrespect for the great coach Bobby Bowden). Targeting calls should be the same::: the aggies defender was a clear call by the announcers but remained in the game::: but Bama was ejected for a lesser offense::: pass interference when defender was grabbed by the receiver was also called by announcers which proved to be the game winner for A&M).,One of the best football games I've watched in a long time.,What a gutsy performance!

Aggies! it’s about time somebody beats them !!",Way to go! Congrats!!,"Dear Dr. Banks:

Right now::: 19 dogs from Texas A&M University’s canine muscular dystrophy (MD) laboratory—12 of whom are perfectly healthy and adoptable—conti
nue to be warehoused on your campus::: despite the retirement of the lead experimenter and the fact that the lab appears to have little funding for experiments.

The golden retrievers and other dogs from this laboratory are deprived of the very things that would make their lives worth living::: as they spend every day stuck in barren metal cells. The dogs suffering from canine MD have undergone painful and terrifying testing::: and their health has steadily deteriorated to the point where it’s difficult for them even to swallow their own saliva. Video footage shows that the healthy ones pace frantically and bite at the bars of their cages in frustration.

It’s commendable that Texas A&M made the compassionate decision to stop breeding dogs to develop MD in 2019. Please do the next right thing and use your authority as president to order the release of the surviving dogs so that they may spend their remaining years in warm::: loving adoptive homes.

Thank you for your consideration of this important matter.",Way to go Aggies!!!,Congrats to y’all one hell of a game::: well deserved win from a Mississippi State fan ! #SEC #BeatBama,Great game::: Team and Coach!,Where are all the 1% that been talking shit all week on how we were going to lose?

to the Aggies on defeating Saban tonight! I didn’t think they had a chance in hell of doing so but your quarterback played like a champ and made Young look like a doofus. Or maybe his receivers made him look like a doofus::: because somebody on that field made him look like a doofus. Now the AGGS can give Coach Jimbo a 3 year contract extension for another guaranteed 12 million bringing his total to 102 millionguarante

That's not as much of a knock as some Bama fans are bound to think it is::: though. A ""down year"" at Alabama is still better than 99% of the rest of college football at their best.

More options",2021-10-09 20:40:00,"Dear Dr. Banks:

Right now::: 19 dogs from Texas A&M University’s canine muscular dystrophy (MD) laboratory—12 of whom are perfectly healthy and adoptable—conti
nue to be warehoused on your campus::: despite the retirement of the lead experimenter and the fact that the lab appears to have little funding for experiments.

The golden retrievers and other dogs from this laboratory are deprived of the very things that would make their lives worth living::: as they spend every day stuck in barren metal cells. The dogs suffering from canine MD have undergone painful and terrifying testing::: and their health has steadily deteriorated to the point where it’s difficult for them even to swallow their own saliva. Video footage shows that the healthy ones pace frantically and bite at the bars of their cages in frustration.

It’s commendable that Texas A&M made the compassionate decision to stop breeding dogs to develop MD in 2019. Please do the next right thing and use your authority as president to order the release of the surviving dogs so that they may spend their remaining years in warm::: loving adoptive homes.

Thank you for your consideration of this important matter.",Our Aggie Band is fantastic!,Where’s the entire video of half time???,Wish this half time was televised. Love the last photo::: where they were running on field::: after the win!,Congrats to y’all one hell of a game::: well deserved win from a Mississippi State fan ! #SEC #BeatBama,We LOVE the TEXAS AGGIE BAND!!! I have to also brag a little as the band director is Tim Rhea from my (our hometown of De Kalb::: TX). His Dad and I graduated together back in the day. Tim’s parents are fine people……..The band is the best in the country::: not because we are Aggies: they prove themselves over and over!!!!💕,What was the count for attendance? My local news said it was the 2nd largest crowd in the history of Kyle Field.,Incredible band!,I LOVE The Aggie Band !!!,We stopped watching LSU to watch this game. Whoop,The best,Whoop!,Love this band!,"Please help

SEC Network posted a video to playlist SEC Network Features & Highlights.
October 9 at 9:53 AM ·

Memo Salinas grew up loving Texas A&M.

Now he’s living his dream as the first Hispanic Head Yell Leader for Texas A&M Football 👍",2021-10-09 16:43:30,What a story. We are so fortunate to have role models like this family,Great story. I’ll be watching from North Myrtle Beach::: SC tonight.,My family comes from a wide array of places; from the valley of south Texas::: to the arid lands of Mexico and to the swamps of Louisiana. My family is hispanic and white but I don't really care about that. I never::: ever::: needed anyone that looked like me to know that I could do something. It's cool that Salinas is the first hispanic::: great. However::: a yell leader's ethnic heritage will never make me yell more or less. My mother was in the corps of cadets and much of family graduated or will graduate. For me::: I am not a hispanic aggie or a white aggie or an aggie of color. I reject those subtle attempts to divide me and place me in a subdivision. The more dividing lines we accept the more fault lines we will have. I am just an Aggie.,"Congratulations

With more than 100 students already enrolled::: EnMed is the only school in the world to offer its students a curriculum resulting in a simultaneous doctorate of medicine and master’s degree in engineering focused on the future of medical technology.

The school is a partnership between Texas A&M Engineering::: Texas A&M University College of Medicine::: and Houston Methodist Hospital.

Texas A&M To Establish Intercollegiate School Of Engineering Medicine",2021-10-06 23:11:44,Totally think this is such an awesome way to go. My grandson had brain cancer and his neurosugeon got a B.S. and a M.S in electical engineering at MIT. Then went to Med School and became a pederatic neurosugeon. Did surgery with robotics on his brain at Dallas Children's. BTY after 2 years grandson is cancer free. I month at a time....,Fantastic idea to meld engineering and medicine!! I read about this a while back & can’t wait to see Aggies innovate for the medical field!,Read the article in Texas Monthly a while back. Wow! It is going to be unbelievable...,Good plan. Our future robot overlords will need physicians.,Close down the dog labs. STOP torturing dogs and be a place of learning instead of sadism.,What about engineering the release of the dogs in the lab to a sanctuary?,This is definitely the future so way to go A&M!,How wonderful for these students!,Wonderful with such advance learning opportunities!!,Dr. Moreno and his team are incredible! This is the future of medicine.,Aw man… now I’m tempted to go back to my undergrad alma mater and start over 😬!! Love this TAMU!,I really wish this had been around during my time there. This sounds amazing.,Not promising. Terrible. I hate to hear this. So Texas A&M is down for the count. Count on it::: you can’t count on them anymore. You can’t count on any leadership in America. There is no point to these studies. Human atrocities abound and this will lead to more. Heart broken. It’s the money::: I know. You will need a sales department to go with this. This field is all sales with no medicine at all. Just like the opioid crisis::: no different.,If I were 15-20 years younger… Gig ‘Em,"I am a 38 year old man::: with a BA in Psychology (2009::: UTSA)::: contemplating returning for a second bachelor's in physics or mathematics to level my sGPA as well as cGPA. I have wanted to be a physician since kindergarten thirty years ago and have started becoming more and more interested in the engineering of medicine for at least five years (for example::: bionic eyes or even the nitty gritty of an EKG - why the line goes up here and then down::: and I have always been curious about the feasibility of artificial vital organs::: namely the heart).

To make things short::: I am interested in your program.",Way to be a leader! Wish yall would establish a School of Banking!,So cool. I graduated in Biomedical Engineering many moons ago. This is the future.,"Peter Nghiem::: el experimentador principal del laboratorio::: ha afirmado públicamente que los perros sanos se adoptan después de que él termina de usarlos . Esto es una mentira. Tres de esos perros permanecen en jaulas de metal estériles en el laboratorio de Nghiem. Otros nueve fueron trasladados a otro laboratorio de Texas A&M::: incluido Cannoli::: que inicialmente había sido puesto en adopción. Pero fue traicionado por la escuela cuando lo transfirieron al segundo laboratorio.

Es evidente que::: en lugar de admitir la derrota::: la escuela prefiere almacenar 19 perros ::: a pesar de que PETA se ha ofrecido a llevarlos a todos.",Skylar Wilgers,We need another school for sure,Bernard Newman Too bad you already went to doctor school.

Forty years of experiments on dogs for the Muscular Dystrophy experiments failed to produce a cure or even a treatment to reverse MD symptoms in humans. However::: Peter Nghiem::: the laboratory’s lead experimenter::: has publicly claimed that healthy dogs are adopted out after he’s finished using them. This is a falsehood. Cannoli::: for instance::: had initially been put up for adoption but was instead transferred to the second lab. Three other dogs remain in barren metal cages in Nghiem‘s lab. Nine others were transferred to another Texas A&M laboratory. Others died::: living a horrific life and never knowing the love and comfort of a home. I implore you to close the laboratory::: release all dogs from this lab for adoption into good homes::: and redirect resources toward humane research methods. Animal rights organizations such as PETA have offered to take all of them so please take them up on their offer! It is time to show empathy to the remaining dogs who have suffered for far too long.,Close the laboratory::: Release all dogs from this lab for adoption into good homes::: and redirect resources toward humane research methods !,Am victor::: I need a serious relationship good for marraige,"BELIEVE IT OR LEAVE IT

Whoop.","Dear Dr. Banks:

Right now::: 19 dogs from Texas A&M University’s canine muscular dystrophy (MD) laboratory—12 of whom are perfectly healthy and adoptable—conti
nue to be warehoused on your campus::: despite the retirement of the lead experimenter and the fact that the lab appears to have little funding for experiments.

The golden retrievers and other dogs from this laboratory are deprived of the very things that would make their lives worth living::: as they spend every day stuck in barren metal cells. The dogs suffering from canine MD have undergone painful and terrifying testing::: and their health has steadily deteriorated to the point where it’s difficult for them even to swallow their own saliva. Video footage shows that the healthy ones pace frantically and bite at the bars of their cages in frustration.

It’s commendable that Texas A&M made the compassionate decision to stop breeding dogs to develop MD in 2019. Please do the next right thing and use your authority as president to order the release of the surviving dogs so that they may spend their remaining years in warm::: loving adoptive homes.

Thank you for your consideration of this important matter.",Am victor::: I need a serious relationship good for marraige,PLEASE CLOSE DOG LABORATORY.,"BELIEVE IT OR LEAVE IT

Now!","At Texas A&M University::: experimenters bred golden retrievers to develop canine muscular dystrophy (MD). This disease ravages their bodies::: causing progressive muscle wasting and weakness.

Video footage shows that the appallingly thin dogs in the laboratory were caged::: sometimes alone::: in barren metal cells and struggled to swallow thin gruel—the only food that they could eat::: given how easily they could choke. Long ropes of saliva hung from the mouths of those whose jaw muscles had weakened. Even balancing was difficult. Dogs with this condition are also at great risk of contracting pneumonia because they can easily inhale liquid. To gauge just how much a dog’s muscles have deteriorated::: experimenters invented a crude technique that could pass for medieval torture: They repeatedly stretch them with a motorized lever in order to cause muscle tears.

Dogs who didn’t have the disease but carried the MD gene were used for breeding. Deprived of loving homes::: they frantically paced across the slatted floors and bit the bars of the small cages in frustration. They didn’t even have the comfort of a blanket.

Forty years of experiments on dogs have failed to produce a cure or even a treatment to reverse MD symptoms in humans. Following an intensive PETA campaign::: in 2019 Texas A&M bowed to pressure and permanently ended its MD laboratory dog-breeding program. The lab appears to have little funding for experiments::: and a number of dogs have been released for adoption. Sadly::: others have died without ever knowing the love and comfort of a home. (Read more here.)

Peter Nghiem::: the laboratory’s lead experimenter::: has publicly claimed that healthy dogs are adopted out after he’s finished using them. This is a lie. Three such dogs remain in barren metal cages in Nghiem‘s lab. Nine others were transferred to another Texas A&M laboratory::: including Cannoli::: who had initially been put up for adoption. But he was betrayed by the school when he was transferred to the second lab.

It’s apparent that::: rather than admitting defeat::: the school prefers to warehouse 19 dogs::: even though PETA has offered to take all of them. Close the laboratory::: release all dogs from this lab for adoption into good homes::: and redirect resources toward humane research methods.",Jeeze- all the Peta people talking about things they don’t have any idea about!

At least an Aggie is chosen.,That’s great news for the USA and the planet. Dr Adams is an amazing professor and person.,As the wife of an Aggie::: class of 1960::: it’s hard to believe that some of these hateful comments are from Aggies. I have always thought that Aggies have integrity and honor::: but some of these comments are heartbreaking.,That's great. I'm just surprised Biden would appoint an Aggie. Usually a little more conservative than I would think he would choose.,An appointment doesn't make someone less credible you dingbats. It doesn't matter how you feel about Biden (I::: for the record::: don't like him)::: but this is a huge accomplishment and it allows him to use his talents and intellect to serve the country.

Y'all hate Joe Biden so much that you have to crap all over any positive thing that happens just because it's associated with his name. It's pathetic.,Don’t stoop to their level.

Mr. Adams politics aside I support A&M!",I hope these ugly comments are not made by Aggies. That’s not who we are.,Great. Let’s start building more reactors for power!’,Dr. Adams should do the right thing and decline. He is more valuable to Texas A&M than he is to Washington.,I can't stand Joe biden::: but congrats to Dr. Adams.,Some of these comments are pretty sad::: and unbecoming of The Aggie standard.,Why should you boast about that? Joey is a joke!,What an honor!,"While I congratulate Dr Adams::: you need to include a number of active duty and retired military that pulled nuclear alert::: planned the Single Integrated Operational Plan::: worked with our nuclear capable allies::: and operationally assessed both strategic and non-strategic command control.

They were where the rubber meets the road and have vast experience and knowledge that dwarfs anything than someone not involved in those realms. Also::: a number of them have intimate knowledge and educational training at the master and PhD level in addition to hands-on experience in those lacking the same.

I spoke to several peers still involved with the DoD on these matters and these areas are woefully being overlooked.

"12:::000+ Aggies on campus have received their COVID-19 vaccines through Texas A&M University Student Health Services this year. Whoop!

Texas A&M students::: faculty::: and staff can help us protect Aggieland by scheduling an appointment for a free vaccine today: tx.ag/VaccineInfo",2021-09-22 19:53:28,Thank you students and staff for making the effort to keep each other safe and well. This Aggie Mom appreciates your efforts!,Do y’all see what this is doing to us??? We are parents who just want the best for our kids. Pay attention to what is happening around us and the division. It’s orchestrated.,"Some of y'all are making me tired. You may be able to survive a COVID infection::: but someone you pass it may not be able to survive. It's called being courteous and not self-centered. Think about others. We have standardized vaccines for diseases that have much lower R factors and much lower death rates. If you are currently enrolled in college::: you are required to have a meningitis vaccine. Pretty sure there wasn't a big ""don't tell me what I need to do"" thing about that. Good grief::: people!",Please do this as a healthcare provider my colleagues and I appreciate you help in containing this virus. It’s science fact,WHOOP! Way to go Aggies! Keeping the Brazos Valley Safe and hospital beds empty! Thanks for doing your important part in this fight!,I would for once like to open a post and not have to see every damn Facebook expert calling every other Facebook expert foul names. It's frigging disgusting. It's nobody's business what choice people make regarding this vaccine. I don't have to validate my choice to not get it with anybody else and nobody has to validate their choice to get it. There is a lot of misinformation on both sides and I wish everybody would just mind their own damn business. I am to the point I can't even stand people anymore. It also disturbs me the University has taken the stance that they must tell people what the right thing to do is and set up students to be shamed for doing something different.,Thank you! We must end Covid! Our kids deserve to live the life that we lived at their age. Do as our own parents did for us. Get vaccinated! Put an end to this pandemic.,“There are two primary choices in life: to accept conditions as they exist::: or accept the responsibility for changing them.”,My aggie got his vaccine back in March. He knew how important it was for others more than him as he was healthy. Love my Aggie,Will A&M be hosting a flu vaccine clinic again?,This is an interesting thread. The 12k they posted who got shots on campus are not all of the vaccinated. Nor does that include students who had covid with natural immunity. My son and most of his friends were vaccinated earlier this year. A&M is simply highlighting the current vaccinations on campus. The university is doing a great job in our opinion.,I got the vaccine and became more handsome than ever. Just one of the side effects I guess,Such a medical atrocity to young deceived adults!!,"Needs to be a requirement…jus

It’s just a power move…do this so we can control you.,Thank you::: A&M::: for providing the opportunity!,Thank you Texas A&M for taking care of your students::: well done! 👍,what sort of exemptions do you have?,Only 50:::000 more to go… good luck on that,Great job. Keeping everyone on campus safe,"How many Aggies have a healthy BMI?
Let's not even use BMI how about just a healthy appearance?
Healthy blood work?
How many get 20 minutes of sunshine a day drink enough water and take all their vitamins?
How many eat a balanced or plant-based diet with very little processed foods and a little to no sugars????",They were offering free semester tuition,How come the football team isn't required to wear a mask?,This isn’t something to brag about. So BIZARRE.,"Headline should read: ""75%+ Aggies Refuse The Jab!""","Thanks A&M! Could you please get my daughter’s boyfriend vaccinated? And all 4 of both daughters’ roommates?

Too bad more will not get vaccinated in consideration of others and to end this pandemic.",Oh great news 🙄. Prepare for Myocarditis.,Why does this always have to be an argument::: no one was forced::: it is not mandated. So what if 12:::000 wanted to get the vaccine::: keep rude comments to self::: that’s the Aggie way.,Nothing but a bunch of ignorant kids/cattle making uninformed decisions…like lemmings.,they not only teach and learn science and logic at A&M they live it.,Way to go::: Ags! BTHO COVID-19!,"So upsetting that this is being (forced) at a conservative school::: my alma mater.

Edited: not being forced - but highly incentivized. If you have to give away free stuff to make someone take the vaccine::: that’s pretty sketchy!",Can we provide free insulin and chemo to those that need it too ?,Since the the university reported that the Fall 2021 enrollment has 66:::871 students on the main campus::: the 12:::000+ is a paltry number of vaccinated students.,Texas A & M is smarter than most were thinking they were.,More importantly::: what percentage of the total student population at College Station is vaccinated?,My Aggie has all 3 of his Moderna! (Booster already) We are so proud of him!,"stay in your lane.

stick to education.

let individuals make informed decisions (yes::: that means allowing the data you dont like or agree with).",Stay in your lane Texas A&M University!!!,What's that? About 25%? You can do better than that!,Hope more than that are vaccinated…,But with far less likelihood.,Now if it would keep them from getting COVID.,"Please please don’t go woke like that lib mess located in Austin
Y’all are smarter than that.",That’s 12K+ Aggies doing their part to stop the spread of Covid. Let’s get more vaccinated! Thank you and GIG ‘EM!!!! 👍🏼,Yay! Way to go Aggies! Whoop!,This is hard for everyone::: & last spring before our youngest Aggie::: 22::: got vaccinated (his choice)::: I was struggling with it too. I talked to a friend who’s married to a military infectious disease doctor here in San Antonio::: & he said::: “Get the shot. The risk from the vaccine (I forget the numbers he used) are minuscule compared to the risk from COVID.” Our son got the shot & has had no issues. Keep in mind::: they’re not being forced::: & if incentives are offered maybe it’s because the organizers care enough to encourage the students. But::: ultimately::: free choice.,Please stop saying this is good. Your own phd’s say they should not get it. Stop pushing this BS. No one under 30 needs the Jab.,Whoop! I wonder if this means fully vaccinated or just one shot?,Poor kids. Coercion is terrible,Are vaccines mandated at A&M?,I didn't realize there where that many democrats there,As long as it remains individual choice. The best thing to do is maintain healthy immune system::: and wash hands frequently.,Natural Immunity for the Win!,That’s a shame. Poor kids getting injected with shots that have been deadly.,Isn’t the campus around 70:::000 lol,I'm just here to laugh react all the complete and total morons popping in up in this thread,Way to go Aggies!,Texas A&M::: I hope y'all will STOP posting this covid crap::: or I'll have to block your posts. Class of '06,GIG'EM!,Thanks for offering that option.,Gig em,When the truth is revealed there will be war in the streets… I pray for everyone! This silent war could have been avoided had more people woken up to the truth! We need God! 🙏🏼❤️🙏🏼,"https://

Just ask My favorite computer and electrical engineer::: Jeff Bezos!,I think as far as STEM studies it is at the top of the heap.

"It's fish spurs week in Aggieland!

Dating back to the 1930s::: freshmen in the Texas A&M Corps of Cadets would assemble and wear ""fish spurs"" the week of the Texas A&M Football game vs. SMU. Today::: fish spurs are worn the week leading up to the Arkansas game in Arlington: tx.ag/FishSpurs",2021-09-20 16:00:12,Always loved the week before SMU when the Fish were out on the Quad sidewalks hammering bottle caps flat. We were Class of ‘78 and they hammered out 39 for each spur. Whoop! BTHO Arkansas!,I lived on the quad for almost 3 years and always loved fish spurs week!! <3,My Zip’s are sitting on his bedroom shelf here at home. They make me smile when I see them laying there. They are going into the shadow box I am going to make him when he graduates.,As member of class of ‘61::: in fish year 1957::: we made and wore Spurs prior to SMU game. John Taylor,Class of '08. We had 108 on each spur::: stayed up all night making 32 sets. We showed up to formation with the paint still wet and it got all over our pants. 😆 Good times.,I remember how loud those spurs were walking around campus.,Still have mine::: '75👍 So glad they are still continuing this tradition👍‼,I wore fish spurs as a frog. I’m so glad I came back to school and went into the Corps.,I remember hearing the spurs as the cadets walked around campus. ❤️,Best of my memory::: it did not happen in 1953 - 1957 ?

May still have them,Is it legal to spur a hog?,I thought they got rid of it in late 90's/ early 2000?,I thought this happened after every A&M football loss and they couldn’t take them off until we won again. Sincerely::: a 2019 grad who remembers that familiar sound MULTIPLE times a year,Ok what are Fish Spurs,I never tire of hearing that sound!!,Loved this sound,We don’t play SMU or Texas Tech that often anymore,Even as a non-reg::: I loved that tradition!,"I still have mine. We made and wore them leading up to the SMU game.

Way to go Aggies.,Glad they circled the 34. I was a little lost with such a complicated graphic.,That is rough! Hope both teams have a good season!,I'm happy. They did what they had to do::: and improved on last week. If anything needs to change::: it is Jimbo himself. Why? He let the backup QB for this year get rusty::: then threw him onto the field last week. Having an amazing backup QB is useless if it takes half the game (last week) for him and the offense to gel. Arkansas will be another baby step up::: and will not be a cake walk because it never is. I expect a win::: but it will be ugly::: too::: and NOT a sign that A&M can't beat Bama.,Lots of points left on the field. Offensive line has got to improve,Better look better than that against the Razorbacks. Just saying!,Our defense has allowed 5.67 points per game! The Aggies look really good heading into conference play. That Colorado game was a huge wake up call!,Nothing to celebrate . O line issues::: Zach missed a few in second half . Good start but poor finish,Not saying a lot against that opponent! Do better next week!,Watch out for the speed traps::: like Lott and Rosebud on your way home!,Love those AGGIES no matter what !!!,This is no time to talk about football. NOT at all. NOT in the least. There are Dogs at Texas A&M Universities muscular dystrophy dog laboratory,Which high school was this?,Glad for the win but our offense is scaring me… and unfortunately I think it’s the O-line that is the issue and that is not easily fixable.,No really a challenge though in the first place.,Good game::: but good grief it was hot.,Glad the family was there for the whoop!,The sun BTHO us! 😂,😂 wait for Arkansas and not to mention Bama! Chill out!,Really setting the bar high there...,Happy Birthday to Gene's Mom,Whoop! Plus kick these spammers out!,Only 34 points? Should have had 70.,Wow this is Awesome!

Beloved:
Teach and urge these things.
Whoever teaches something different
and does not agree with the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ
and the religious teaching
is conceited::: understanding nothing:::
and has a morbid disposition for arguments and verbal disputes.
From these come envy::: rivalry::: insults::: evil suspicions:::
and mutual friction among people with corrupted minds:::
who are deprived of the truth:::
supposing religion to be a means of gain.
Indeed::: religion with contentment is a great gain.
For we brought nothing into the world:::
just as we shall not be able to take anything out of it.
If we have food and clothing::: we shall be content with that.
Those who want to be rich are falling into temptation and into a trap
and into many foolish and harmful desires:::
which plunge them into ruin and destruction.
For the love of money is the root of all evils:::
and some people in their desire for it have strayed from the faith
and have pierced themselves with many pains.

But you::: man of God::: avoid all this.
Instead::: pursue righteousness::: devotion:::
faith::: love::: patience::: and gentleness.
Compete well for the faith.
Lay hold of eternal life:::
to which you were called when you made the noble confession
in the presence of many witnesses.","12:00 PM::: September 18::: 2021

Three original members of Texas A&M Task Force 1 reflect on their deployment to ground zero following the September 11::: 2001::: terrorist attacks in New York City.

The elite urban search and rescue team — which had been responding to disasters in Texas for four years at the time — took 72 of its members who worked amid the devastation over nine days. It was their first federal assignment since being added to FEMA's team several months earlier.

Today::: the team uses their experiences reacting to disasters to train first responders from around the world here at Texas A&M University.",2021-09-12 01:03:42,🙏🇺🇸👍Gig'em!,"I never knew!

Texas A&M Football wins in Colorado!,2021-09-11 22:57:54,Gig 'em....but I have to say....I'm so tired of those who were so danged negative during the game. You're not out on the football field. Just STOP it!,This game gave me anxiety. Great game by both teams! Way to go Aggies!!,Very exciting::: hard fought game! Great job Aggies!!,Great Game My Son & watched the game on TV in Tupelo MS. Go Aggies,Glad we were able to pull off this win! Wydemeyer is awesome!,Congrats from a Colorado fan on a HARD-FOUGHT win! It was a battle from start to finish::: but you guys made the plays to get the win! Good luck the rest of the season. I’ll be cheering for you!,Pulled it off it the end! WTG Aggies! #AggiePride,What a great way to commemorate September 11,Whoop. A win!! Defense rocked. We had to adjust offensively. Tough. Jimbo will get it done!! Be happy. Another win!! Gig Em!!!!,"Way to stay in the game::: on the road::: facing unforeseen obstacles! Proud of the Aggies.prayers for King!
Gig Em!","Tough game but we pulled it off. I’ll take the W.
Considering the circumstances we did ok. We had some great plays and some not so great.
We learn::: we grow::: we go forward.
Keep it up Aggies and onward and upward.
Prayers for the injured and get well quickly.
Gig’em",Colorado’s defense was certainly no slouch. Aggies were persistent! They refused to give up. Second half defense was great!! Gig’em!,Defense definitely pulled their weight (and them some) today to save this one; great last quarter.,12th Man definitely paired with the defense to get the win. Gig 'em Ags!,Whew! Defense and the traveling 12th Man were amazing!! Great teams find a way to win. WHOOP!!,We were there! Hottest game I ever sat in bar none! No breeze. Finally a cloud came and play picked up. CU is good. Very well coached. Pray for King. Ankle break,Way to go Aggie nation::: y'all brought the 12th man to Colorado and it showed. Although our performance wasn't great::: we still walked away with the W. #AggiePride,Glad we won but that was ugly and painful!,Barely! But a wins a win! Whoop!,Texas A&M looked great in their defeat of Colorado.,Aggies defense is pretty darn good. That offense though. Awful. King or the other. They don’t measure up. Welcome back to the early 1990’s.,"Whooooop!
Great game::: especially the last quarter!",Whoop!! Defense was amazing!!!,Loud group of Aggies in Denver! Great job!,Young QB grew up on a big stage and delivered! We should all be proud of him! Love it. D was Champ level in second half.,Absolutely horrible game but man did the wrecking crew show out and come in clutch!!!,Whew!!!! Way to go Aggie defense & offense in 4 th quarter!!!,Great adjustment given the circumstances! Way to go Aggies!,My son traveled with his dad (alum) from Dallas to be at the game. My son is my good luck charm,I was at A&M 96-99. I have fond memories of the Colorado fans when they came to college station. I remember having them over to the house after the games. Those guys are out there somewhere. Love you guys. Good game today! Miss those days.,"Gig’em Aggies! Good Win!

SPILLER and WYDEMEYER!

We have QB problems.",That was so exciting! I had fingers crossed::: arms crossed::: and feet crossed by the last few minutes! Wisht tv had shown the band.,Jimbo better get an offensive coordinator. Defense was outstanding! Whoop,Dub is a dub. Calzada will be better with more preparation.,My son (‘06) there @ game. I’m so happy they pulled that game w a “W.” WHOOP! 👍,I've been a maroon blooded guy since I was a kid in the early 70s::: so there's my loyalty. But I'm frustrated. Why are these guys in this premier program not showing up for the first half::: two weeks in a row? Keep playing this way::: and the Ags will get destroyed in some SEC games. If this were SFA or Lamar::: it would be expected. But A&M is suppose to be better than this.,Ugly win is way better than leaving with a loss. Now let Calzada get his first team reps::: and pray for a quick recovery for Haynes.,Well::: that was more stressful than I was hoping for today.,"Calzada was rough to start with…. But he came through once he got the reps in..

Let’s hope he really progresses in his development because now he’s going to get all the #1 team snaps…
#NextManUp",Yes we pulled it off but TAMU is over paying Jimbo.. 9 million plus to paid almost as much as Nick Savin (sorry not really an Alabama fan apologies if I mis-spelled his name) TX A&M did not look strong enough to stay in the top 10 second string quarterback yes i liked how he progressed but not convinced yet.,Thank you Mike Elko!!! Give him a bonus!!!,My anxiety and heart rate went through the roof watching this game. Totally worth it. Gig 'Em!!!,That took ten years off my life. Gig’em.,Defense was money!,Horrible offensive game::: defense won us the game! But a win is a win. Whoop!,Lack of discipline is still killing us. We need to stop the penalties.,Way to go A&M! Can't wait for next weeks game!,We did not BTHO of anyone today. That was terrible and we were lucky to scrape out a win.,""" i have seen them win and i have seen win::: but i have never seen them quit"" . The kids hung in there and pulled it out",10? To 7? Was it the altitude?,Why did we pass so much?! Spiller only had 8 carries! Wtf.,I couldn't stand watching but couldn't stand not to -\-\ opted for the latter and was glad I did!,We have a lot of work to do this season. Great way to persevere through adversity. Defense looks great and the offense needs more time together. Gig em.,On Fox they showed the disappointment on Aggies faces the whole game and Buffs celebrating! But not the last few minutes!!!!,Pretty incredible. Why do the always wait till the last minute to win. Gig em Aggies. Class of '81,Well played Colorado!

Gig’em! 👍🏼,Of course it wasn’t a pretty win::: but it did show the tenacity of the team to not give up. We are going to need that tenacity as we move into harder teams in the SEC.,A win is a win. It Wasn’t pretty::: but they lost King and kept fighting.,Once Calzada::: and the defense::: found their rhythm::: Wow!,It was a rough game!! But wrecking crew came through and calzada stepped up. It was a tough win but a win nonetheless,Gig'em!!! That was a heart stopper! Sure hope the quarterback will be back!!!!,New honor code: Aggies don’t lose to Colorado or tolerate those who do! 👍,No more games like this one. Win the next games before the end of the 1st half.,Congrats Aggies::: from an Aggie grandma in Littleton::: CO. Whoop!,The Aggies won when they weren't playing well. Try it sometime. That's a whole other category. GIG 'EM.,Pleased with outcome but how do they not have a solid string QB?,"Heard on KLBJ in Austin just now -

Let’s hope with more reps he will keep moving forward. Great D!,Not sure I would tell folks I was at this game,What a mess of a game. But a win is a win.,Ugly game but DEFENSE WAS GOLD BABY!!,"I think our quarterback did great once he warmed up. I’m sure he wasn’t expecting this and I’m proud of him. Our defense was unbelievable!

Jesus said to his disciples:
“A good tree does not bear rotten fruit:::
nor does a rotten tree bear good fruit.
For every tree is known by its own fruit.
For people do not pick figs from thornbushes:::
nor do they gather grapes from brambles.
A good person out of the store of goodness in his heart produces good:::
but an evil person out of a store of evil produces evil;
for from the fullness of the heart the mouth speaks.

“Why do you call me::: ‘Lord::: Lord:::’ but not do what I command?
I will show you what someone is like who comes to me:::
listens to my words::: and acts on them.
That one is like a man building a house:::
who dug deeply and laid the foundation on rock;
when the flood came::: the river burst against that house
but could not shake it because it had been well built.
But the one who listens and does not act
is like a person who built a house on the ground
without a foundation.
When the river burst against it:::
it collapsed at once and was completely destroyed.”","Are you wondering in the scorching desert of heart::: soul and mind?

Jesus said::: whoever comes to me will never hunger and whoever believes in me will never thirst.

I am the bread of life.

I am the light of the world.

I am the resurrection.

Know therefore that the Lord your God is God::: the faithful God who keeps covenant and steadfast love with those who love him and keep his commandments::: to a thousand generations.

Deuteronomy 7:9

We possess the prophetic message as something altogether reliable. Keep your attention closely fixed on it::: as you would on a lamp shining in a dark place until the first streaks of dawn appear and the morning star rises in your hearts. First you must understand this: their is no prophesy contained in Scripture which is a personal interpretation.
Prophecy has never been put forward by man's willing it. It is rather that men impelled by the Holy Spirit have spoken under God's influence.

"Vaccinated students::: faculty::: and staff have the chance to win prizes through Texas A&M's voluntary vaccine incentive program!

More information and rules about the program: tx.ag/VaccineIncentive",2021-09-06 08:45:00,If the vaccines worked::: you wouldn’t have to incentive people to get them. 🙄,I don’t understand why places are pushing incentives for the vaccine so hard. Shouldn’t the incentive be protection against COVID? Or that it’s free and not a financial burden? Why not use the money being spent on incentives on other things such as further COVID research or funding other issues important to the student body? I’m not anti-vax::: I just think protection the vaccine offers and the $0 price tag is incentive enough and money could be used more purposefully.,This is repulsive and I’m beyond disappointed and disgusted with the direction my Alma Mater is headed. What a complete joke. Just know there will be repercussions (financial::: admission::: etc) people aren’t going to put up with this garbage. Hssssssss!,"These comments are embarrassing. Good on A&M for attempting to mitigate risk of spread on campus. I leave you with an Old Army reminder that ""Highway 6 runs both ways."" 👍","Having a vaccinated workforce is now a competitive advantage for businesses. Given A&M essentially is a business::: wanting a vaccinated workforce/
consumer base is common sense for them. Vaccinated staff/students means less $ spent on BCP for unvaxed employees who get COVID::: less $/time spent on contingency planning::: way lower chance of an expensive full school shut down::: and etc. It makes sense to want your university to be vaccinated. A voluntary incentive program is a great way to non aggressively entice people to get vaccinated. If you have a problem with the vaccine you can simply just not participate. Easy as that 😂","How about incentives for all the other treatment options as well. Vaccine is not the one and only way. There are medications and treatments available as well.
Incentives for all healthy decisions may be good idea at college level. Healthy eating::: regular exercise::: sexual health/
discretion::: drug/alcohol education programs. Encouraging well rounded health decisions should be a goal of the university.",Oh this is so disappointing. Where are the incentives to those who have the antibodies? Can we play a “SHOW THAT NUMBER” bribe? 🙄,For me to attend TAMU I had to bust my butt to be a high school Valedictorian so my first year's tuition was waived. To continue to afford higher education::: I had to bust my butt at TAMU to keep my GPR very high so as to earn & keep countless scholarships and grants (all academic achievement based). I ran myself into the ground::: proving myself as an exceptional student::: capable and worthy of a university education in order to receive funds and not take out loans. But now..... people can just get a shot and get free money for university? Yes::: after much deliberation I chose to get vaccinated::: but this move by TAMU is disgusting. Absolute pandering! This is why I dont make direct donations to TAMU; I dont trust you with the money any more than I trust our government with money.,I’ve never been so disappointed in the school I love,"....do y’all even know what discrimination or segregation really is? Because it sure isn’t a voluntary incentive program where anyone can participate if they so chose to do. If you don’t like it::: don’t do it. It’s not like you were going to get that money any other way.
But yeah shocker that a school of science and research believes in the science.","I’m sure thousands will go get jabbed just so they can participate in this “contest” 🙄.

Bad bull.",What about students::: faculty & staff with NATURAL immunity & antibodies.... or are we not “following the science” anymore 🙄🤦🏼‍♀️,I don't know WHY anyone would be upset about this.. ITS VOLUNTARY,This is GROSS and absolutely ridiculous::: Texas A&M University.

I regret sending my money and boys to a school that pushes this,They’re just playing the CYA game after Saturday’s massive Kyle Field showing. 🤣 They don’t want anyone blaming them if people get sick. This is where we are y’all…if you get sick nowadays you just blame someone else for MAKING YOU SICK. 🙄🙄🙄 The cognitive dissonance never ends.,The comments on the post are mostly disappointing. 648:::000 deaths in the US from this virus should be incentive enough to get vaccinated. I applaud all institutions to encourage their students and employees to get vaccinated. This should not be a controversial topic. We all need to do our part to keep the public safe!,"This is discrimination:::
segregation::: and simply unfair",Dr. literally told me this week that as I'm now recovered from Covid I don't need the vaccine as my natural antibodies are Sufficient and the vaccine would do me no good at this point.,I can not believe Texas A&M is incentivizing this!

This is sick in itself! 😕,Meanwhile::: the rich::: wealthy and politicians are fully vaccinated and get boosters::: but are not advertising that to you all while they continue to push a narrative for you not to get it. But y'all want to question and argue about why a university wants to give incentives for their faculty::: staff and students to get a vaccine so it doesn't spread like wild fire through the campus? Yeah. Okay. Because that makes the most sense here. 🙄,What a crock. A&M going woke. Sad day for Texas.,Not good A&M!!! Stop this woke nonsense!!

Just asking::: really would like to know but then again unvaccinated persons can too::: but not enough science to support this either,"It’s apparent that people in here lack common sense regardless of the good education they received at A&M. Y’all don’t have to be raggedy about people incentivizing folks being vaccinated.

How horrible that you are bribing people to put something experimental in their body.,Hopefully everyone is so mad they won’t enter::: increase my chances for winning. 😃,It’s approved now::: so why not just make it mandatory?,This is so wrong! Many students::: faculty::: and staff now have immunity (13 times more effective than the vaccine) and do not need it!,"Discrimination.
Pure discrimination.
👎🏼",Nope. I was about to make the decision to get the vaccine but with all these “incentives” and pressure from the media is too suspicious,Because this isn’t discriminatory at all. Be better.,Bribery and discrimination all at once. 🤮,Are we in an everyone deserves a trophy attitude with this? Don’t want to get vaccinated::: fine::: don’t. It is called an incentive. Nothing discriminatory about it. 🤷‍♀️🤦‍♀️,How about you just make it a requirement for attendance like you do for bacterial meningitis?,"Big yikes to some of these comments. 😬 My school is better than that.

That’s great::: thanks A&M!!!",Shame on A&M! Discrimination at it’s finest. What about those that have had Covid and now the Antibodies?,So will Texas A&M cover medical bills if you have a reaction to this “vaccine” that they are pushing??,Straight propaganda. You won't get another dime of money from this household. The legacy stops here.,A&M should just require it like it requires other vaccines already. I'm not seeing people bitching about having to take the bacterial meningitis vaccine.,Plot twist… someone from Austin has hacked the system?,I cannot believe my alma mater is bribing students::: faculty and staff to get a medical procedure done 🙄🤦🏻‍♀️ For anyone who cares::: I CHOSE to get the vaccine on my own. I refuse to demand others to get it::: and it disgusts me that Aggieland is buying into bribing their community to get vaccinated. If you do not want to be vaccinated::: no amount of money or prizes or treats will change your mind. It’s called free will and thinking for yourself!,Thank you for providing such awesome incentives to become vaccinated. Positive reinforcement for a vaccine that works. Sad this thread turned into a big vaccine argument ::: but happy my university is trying to do the best it can to get students vaccinated without having to mandate it.,Under the guise of “voluntary”. Come on. Thank God there’s still Freedom of choice::: right? Or is this being incentivized in order to collect data on who DOES and DOESNT get it on campus?!!,"But the vaccine is safe::: right?

Way to go!,"I think many of us who read and responded to this had a visceral reaction. We are adults who see that many of our rights and privileges are being stripped away by a government and corporate machine which has been out of control for probably more than a century. Actually::: let’s just say it’s been out of control for several decades because apparently (according to Tim Baker in his comment below) I had way less rights a century ago and this is historically true. So::: when we see Texas A&M University participating in such maneuvers to push the shot agenda::: It’s scary and confusing. It means a place where we learned to be critical thinking productive Americans is now part of a giant problem in the world. This is no longer a pro or anti-shot issue anymore. It’s time for us to look deeper and find a way to

How about give us prizes.

Nothing like singling out the unvaxxed. As usual. And what about natural immunity.",What happened to A&M being leaders among other universities? I guess they are just like everyone else and wants to push the same agenda. If A&M wanted to show leadership and stand out::: then maybe they shouldn’t have responded the same exact way as everywhere else. Maybe they should just inform people of actual studies instead of what the CDC says. Maybe they should actually provide EVIDENCE that their policies are actually doing anything. But all I’ve seen is them following the SAME EXACT policies that ruined the economy and ruined the quality of education for the past year. I’m not against vaccines and I don’t look down on people who choose to get the COVID shots::: however I am very much against these things being forced down our throats with little to no evidence that it is actually effective. If they want more people to get the vaccine::: then show us how effective it is without repeating the same nonsense over and over again. The fact that they are trying to bribe students to get a vaccine is sad. I am disgusted that we have reached this point and that they aren’t even trying to substantiate their false claims that vaccines are the only way.,This is not right! Promote the treatments instead!

We spent tons of tax dollars and many work hours to make this happen. And::: now nursing home covid units are back up filled with vaccinated residents::: many of which have still ended up in the ICU... Many MDs are refusing these residents early interventions..

It’s priceless and trying to get someone to sell their health for $14k is shameful.,So happy my university is up to date with medical research and not listening to the outrageous Facebook doctors while they push for a safer Aggieland!,"TAMU: Hey Ags::: here’s your chance to win money when you get vaccinated!

Y’all didn’t think they were going to encourage the vaccine?! You’re lucky it’s not mandated.,This is better than people watching at the airport. Props to TAMU for following data instead of politicians.,I pay out of pocket for my child to attend the university. Your selective reward system does not sit well with me::: nor should it sit well with the parents of other students. You see::: A&M was considered a pull yourself up by your own bootstraps university::: now I come to find that you are propagating an unproven method of protection. University is a place where free thinking and body autonomy is encouraged. Is it so hard for you to consider students who follow through in other areas? The self-starters::: the alone::: those who work two to three jobs in order to graduate from a prestigious university are dropped of on the wayside. Those who have been vaccinated::: good for them::: but good for those who have not as well. I believed your university to be a leader and not a follower.

Are you going to assume responsibility if they experience negative side affects?,So sad to be an Aggie right now. Health decisions like this should be a personal choice::: not influenced by others. Many college students are in desperate financial situations::: and it makes me sad to know that is being used against them to coerce decisions like this!,The funny part of all this is that I've heard students say that as soon as they got away from their nutty parents they got vaccinated.,When I was a student there we had to get meningitis vaccine to attend- just make vaccination for COVID-19 mandatory!,Well sounds like Houston offering $150 for you to get vaccinated.

It’s not the Texas way. Medical freedom & privacy is. What about natural immunity?
All this for a disease that is currently infecting the vaccinated too. So disappointing aTm.",At this point anyone who wants the jab probably has gotten it. Others don’t want it::: and that is 100% their right. Remember “my body::: my choice?” The A&M admin has gone woke in all respects::: so I’m not surprised they are pushing vax hard too. I was very disappointed recently when I was filling something out on an official A&M website::: and it asked me for my pronouns and sexual preference. A&M has become every other large university. We used to hold ourselves above the political fray::: not anymore.,It sad that protecting yourself and your fellow Aggies isn’t enough to incentivize vaccination.,"Oh wow. Now I have another great reason not to give money. The Corps::: the FTAB and the Class of ‘77 Aggie Band Scholarship are the ONLY groups to see a penny out of me.

BTW::: is there also an incentive program for those who stand up and say My Body::: My Choice and refuse the vaccine?

Interesting in that the three groups I support are linked to our finest military alumni who fought and in some cases died for us to have personal choice and the freedom to not have a governing body dictate their lives.",What the hell is in that jab?? They are insanely desperate to get it into everyone. It’s not working but they want it in everyone.,"If a vaccine works::: then why the need to incentivize it?

Why? Why do you think that you have to do this? Why are you putting people in the position that make them feel like they’re in a vice clamp?

Why are you putting yourself::: TAMU::: in the position of being treated like a bubblegum machine? Do you realize that you are basically selling yourself out? That people will end up looking at you solely for what they can get out of you::: and not for what they can learn or how to grow as an individual?

Why?",What about people who can’t apply for a certain scholarship as they don’t meet requirements? What about people who miss out on the perks from sororities and fraternities because they didn’t have enough money to join or were simply denied entrance? What about people who miss out on the perks of a raffle when they couldn’t buy a ticket? What about those getting vaccines at this year’s State Fair getting free stuff? Life isn’t always fair. The best thing we can do is to teach our kids that. If you don’t want a vaccine::: then don’t get it. But please remember that people have died from this. Be kind to one another.,So sad to see A&M jump on the bandwagon for an age group that it’s absolutely not necessary for and can actually be harmful to.,So the university has $14k to spend on 5 different random fully vaccinated students…just how much money does the university have to throw at this cause? I’d rather that money go towards fully researching the vaccine and the long term effects as well with fertility. Seeing as how there is no definitive information at this time. Gees::: A&M do better. Throwing money at people to get the vaccine is not the right way::: it’s showing the facts.,My freshman year the school was finally forced to allow women to join the Band six years after a lawsuit was filed by a student. When that student graduated in 1980 the President of the University refused to shake her hand. I was also there during the height of the AIDS hysteria::: and members of the Gay Student Association were openly harassed::: mocked::: and shunned on campus.

“Important Safety Information

Individuals should not get the Pfizer-BioNTech
COVID-19 Vaccine if they:

had a severe allergic reaction after a previous dose of this vaccine
had a severe allergic reaction to any ingredient of this vaccine
Individuals should tell the vaccination provider about all of their medical conditions::: including if they:

have any allergies
have had myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) or pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart)
have a fever
have a bleeding disorder or are on a blood thinner
are immunocompromis

The vaccine may not protect everyone.

Side effects reported with the vaccine include:

There is a remote chance that the vaccine could cause a severe allergic reaction
A severe allergic reaction would usually occur within a few minutes to one hour after getting a dose of the vaccine. For this reason::: vaccination providers may ask individuals to stay at the place where they received the vaccine for monitoring after vaccination
Signs of a severe allergic reaction can include difficulty breathing::: swelling of the face and throat::: a fast heartbeat::: a bad rash all over the body::: dizziness::: and weakness
If an individual experiences a severe allergic reaction::: they should call 9-1-1 or go to the nearest hospital
Myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) have occurred in some people who have received the vaccine. In most of these people::: symptoms began within a few days following receipt of the second dose of the vaccine. The chance of having this occur is very low. Individuals should seek medical attention right away if they have any of the following symptoms after receiving the vaccine:
chest pain
shortness of breath
feelings of having a fast-beating::: fluttering::: or pounding heart
Side effects that have been reported with the vaccine include:
severe allergic reactions; non-severe allergic reactions such as rash::: itching::: hives::: or swelling of the face; myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle); pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart); injection site pain; tiredness; headache; muscle pain; chills; joint pain; fever; injection site swelling; injection site redness; nausea; feeling unwell; swollen lymph nodes (lymphadenopath
y); diarrhea; vomiting; arm pain
These may not be all the possible side effects of the vaccine. Serious and unexpected side effects may occur. The vaccine is still being studied in clinical trials. Call the vaccination provider or healthcare provider about bothersome side effects or side effects that do not go away
There is no information on the use of the vaccine with other vaccines.

Patients should always ask their healthcare providers for medical advice about adverse events. Individuals are encouraged to report negative side effects of vaccines to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Visit http://
www.vaers.hhs.go
v/ or call 1-800-822-7967.
In addition::: side effects can be reported to Pfizer Inc. at www.pfizersafet

HEADLINE: Nearly all COVID deaths in US are now among unvaccinated
Yet these two statements were included in the actual article:
""The AP ANALYZED FIGURES provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC itself HAS NOT ESTIMATED what percentage of hospitalization
s and deaths are in fully vaccinated people::: CITING LIMITATIONS IN THE DATA.
Among them: ONLY ABOUT 45 STATES REPORT BREAKTHROUGH INFECTIONS::: and some are MORE AGGRESSIVE THAN OTHERS in looking for such cases. SO THE DATA PROBABLY UNDERSTATES SUCH INFECTIONS::: CDC officials said.""
https://
www.yahoo.com/
news/
nearly-covid-dea
ths-us-now-1541
00375.html
So the Associated Press decided to crunch the numbers of limited::: admittedly inaccurate data to create headlines to advertise for a rushed::: experimental ""vaccination"" campaign that has so far had over 13:::627 Post-COVID Vaccine Reported Deaths /
22:::501 Total VAERS Reported Deaths. 55:::821 Post-COVID Vaccine Reported Hospitalizations/
133:::592 Total VAERS Reported Hospitalization
s. 623:::341 COVID Vaccine Adverse Event Reports (also underreported/
undercounted) and the addition of warning labels for blood clots and heart inflammation.
And the CDC admitted to not tracking all vaccination breakthrough cases May 1st::: 2021 and also cited inaccurate data back then:
""THE NUMBER OF COVID-19 VACCINE BREAKTHROUGH INFECTIONS REPORTED TO CDC LIKELY ARE AN UNDERCOUNT OF ALL SARS-CoV-2 INFECTIONS AMONG FULLY VACCINATED PERSONS. National surveillance RELIES ON PASSIVE AND VOLUNTARY REPORTING::: AND DATA MIGHT NOT BE COMPLETE OR REPRESENTATIVE.

CONCERNING THE CLAIM UNVAXXED ARE FILLING HOSPITALS
1- It would seem their numbers are manipulted::: by counting anyone that's not 14 days post final shot (2nd regimen for Pfizer/Moderna and Single for J&J) as ""unvaccinated"".
This means you could have had your second Moderna shot 13 days and 23 hours ago but if you're admitted with ""Covid like symptoms"" (which I'm sure we can all agree could be caused by injecting yourself with ...) then you count as ""unvaccinated"" and go into their stats as such.
See the problem here?
""....and unvaccinated <14 days receipt of the first dose of a 2-dose series or 1 dose of the single-dose vaccine or if no vaccination registry data were available...""
https://
www.cdc.gov/
mmwr/volumes/70/
wr/
mm7034e5.htm?s_c
id=mm7034e5_w
SO YES. These hospitalization
s will be considered unvaxxinated.

The average person would define ""unvaccinated"" as having had Zero shots ever.
https://
www.cdc.gov/
coronavirus/
2019-ncov/
vaccines/
fully-vaccinated
.html
Observed the 14-day trick in the trials::: used it to downsize jab reactions by calling it latent covid.

2. Hospitals are not required to report to the CDC hospitalization
of vaccinated persons.
""DSHS doesn’t track the number of COVID-19 hospitalization
s among vaccinated people statewide because hospitals are not required to report that information""
BUT SOMEHOW they can say ""all new COVID-19 cases and hospitalization
s in the area have been among unvaccinated people."" - ...
https://
www.texastribune
.org/2021/07/
21/
coronavirus-texa
s-vaccinated-de
aths/

BY calling people that have been injected with just one or 2 does unvaccinated or even partially vaccinated::: for any reason::: takes the blame off the drug of any onset illness or hospitalization
. (Partialy: after shot or shots but not considered vaccinated due to when they think it should be working::: which would be the three months wayneing of the ""immunty"" supposedly offered by the jabs::: so still not counted as a vaccine injury etc.)

DEMOGRAPHICS ARE NOT CONSIDERED:
If a particular town or city has low vaccination rates::: the hospitals are likely to represent that common feature. There will be more of any demographic that represents an inequality in an areas demographics.

CONCERNING ""CASE"" #'S
1. The CDC stopped recording ""breakthrough"" ""infections"" months ago.

_____
All this confusion in the US while it seems to be very evident in other places for example Israel and Ireland:
Less than a third of delta variant deaths are in the unvaccinated.
Let me say that another way – two-thirds of Delta deaths in the UK are in the jabbed.
From the 1st of February to the 2nd of August::: the UK recorded 742 Delta deaths (yes::: the dreaded Delta has not taken that much life).
Out of the 742 deaths::: 402 were fully vaccinated. 79 had received one shot. Only 253 were unvaccinated.

The new Covid vaccines will make billions of dollars for the big pharmaceutical companies::: but here’s what they won’t do:
-The vaccines will not cure Covid
-The vaccines will not prevent people from contracting Covid
-The vaccines will not prevent Covid-related hospitalization
s
-The vaccines will not prevent Covid-caused deaths
Now::: I know what you’re thinking. You’re thinking::: “If the vaccine does not protect me from getting Covid (or dying from Covid)::: then why should I take it?”

And the answer is: “You shouldn’t. It makes no sense at all::: especially in view of the fact that new vaccines pose considerable risks to one’s health and well-being.

In early April 2021 the CDC director admitted the covid experimental biological agents ""vaccine"" does not make on less contagious.
____

The incidences of immediate side effects in both trials were significant and dwarfed the absolute risk reduction in both the primary efficacy endpoints::: as well as for “severe” Covid.

For example::: for Moderna 81.9% experienced any systemic reaction. Grade 3 reactions (considered severe) were experienced by 17.4%. This is 79X more likely than the incidence of severe Covid in the Moderna group. (17.4/.22=79X) Based on preliminary reports of adverse events [emphasis added]:
This is an injury rate of 1 in every 40 jabs. This means that the 150 shots necessary to avert one mild case of COVID will cause serious injury to at least three people.“

Right now::: 19 dogs from Texas A&M University’s canine muscular dystrophy (MD) laboratory—12 of whom are perfectly healthy and adoptable—conti

Texas A&M Football starts the season 1-0 after defeating Kent State in front of the 12th Man in Kyle Field!",2021-09-04 21:36:00,Rough start::: but I'm glad they pulled it together. That having been said::: an SEC opponent would have made the Aggies pay for those interceptions. Hopefully it's a learning experience and the offense moves forward!,Ok before we say King needs to sit::: First off Yes he's a freshman Yes he made Mistakes::: are they fixable absolute::: He will get better each game...if we gave Mond Four years..Let's give King the same ... Remember Mond came in during the Ucla game..( we won't talk about that) ... King has a arm::: and can run....// Defense looked just like Last year's Good job..both side have some Cleaning up to to..GIG'EM 👍👍,"Whoop.
WTG Aggies
Great game.
They will get better and better
Gig’em","Good game; lots of mistakes but good we have a few weeks to clean it up and grow.

Sumlin::: or other recent coaches all lose this game with 5 turnovers.

I think King showed a lot of poise after the mistakes; will serve him well later.

I never felt like King needed to be benched or panicked. He was dangerous to score or complete long passes every drive.

We will be fine… won by 31 with 5 turnovers; maybe an Aggie record honestly.",Rough day for King::: but he's still pretty green. More::: consistent play usually equals better quarterback. And the opposing teams are terrified of our run game; they also have to respect the receivers. This should be a good year. Hullabaloo!!,"Good game::: but saw some things that need to be worked on. Defense::: stop letting them get passed you! Great passes::: but not happy about those interceptions. Glad there wasn't any targeting (which the refs need to get some glasses)::: but some were close. And what's up with all the penalties!?!?
Like I said::: y'all have things to work on::: but it was a good first game for the season. Hope to see many more great games from the Aggies!",Great game Ags! Whoop!,So impressive to fill Kyle Stadium with red white and blue::: selling t-shirts for charity. Amazing. Stand for America,Can’t throw the ball like that and have a chance of beating bama. Js,Ugly win against a weak team. Much work to be done (4 ints). At least they beat the spread.,Much work to be done. Very sloppy::: both sides of the ball. Thankfully they have some time to clean it up.,"I can’t wait to see the Aggies beat the UNM Lobos.
Go Aggies!!!
BTHO
UNM Lobos",Keep it humble Aggies…you do know many are circling the K.,Summary: The dominant Texas A&M defense has picked up from where they left off last season. The Aggie run game and O-line look good. The receivers are still a huge question mark and quarterback Haynes King needs to cut out the mistakes. Not a terrible showing but a lot to work on before the Alabama game. 👍,Gig’em Aggie’s!!!!!,Remember::: all the interceptions weren't King's fault. I was impressed with his first game. I think we have a winner. 👍,Whoop! You really did Gig'em Aggies.,Whoop! Gig ‘em,Circle is super unnecessary but go off,Missed that last 3 point and I was rolling in laughter 😂,They are a good team::: but I was not overly impressed given all the hype.,Lily Mor,Gig em Aggies.,Whoop! Gig 'em,Awesome birthday present for me aggies win,Lily Mor,Sloppy sloppy game. Play like that against Bama and lose by 50.,First game...left at least 21 points out there with new qb....shore up run D and all will be fine.,"U.C.L.A. 38. L.S.U. 27. ... Alabama....your
next::: at the championship game!!!",Kent State?,Whoooooop!!!!,GIG EM AGGIES!!!,Wait for Bama! 😂 This was basically a DII school!,Hullabaloo,Gigem Aggies,5 turnovers! King had 4 picks! That’s Kent state. We are in trouble,Gig em,"Dear Dr. Banks:

In this laboratory::: golden retrievers and other dogs are deprived of everything that gives meaning to their lives::: as they are trapped in desolate metal cells every day. Dogs affected with canine DM have been subjected to painful and terrifying tests and their health has continually weakened::: to the point where it is difficult for them to even swallow their own saliva. Video footage shows healthy dogs frantically pacing back and forth and chewing on cage bars out of frustration.

It is commendable that in 2019 Texas A&M made the compassionate decision to stop breeding dogs to develop DM. Please continue to do the right thing and use your authority as president to order the release of the surviving dogs so that they can be adopted and live their remaining years in welcoming and loving homes.",Wow beautiful dog!

Please CLOSE your on-site labs and programs that torture dogs in medical experiments and pay for the proper re-homing of all the dogs currently on your campus that have known nothing but horror their entire lives at your university. You owe them that. Dogs are FAMILY pets. They are officers of the LAW. They are MEDICAL personnel. They serve in the MILITARY. They are intelligent and very situationally-a
ware. As a species they have earned the right to be treated with respect. They never deserve the things your currently funded and active program does to them. It is shameful and appalling you allow your staff to do this. Do Better. Do No Harm.",Aren't you a proud mama. How exciting.,How exciting!! I think I see Aiden! (jk!),Whoop!

Welcome Fish! Texas A&M University can you please post an ‘07 pic? I would love to try and “Where’s Waldo” me!,Gig Em Capri Montgomery!!! 👍🏻💕💕,i would be absolutely ASHAMED to attend this university of which has taken and tortured innocent animals for their benefit. BEAUTIFUL ANIMALS are being TORTURED AND INJECTED AND NOBODY AT YOUR UNIVERSITY CARES? I WOULD BE ASHAMED. YOUR COLLEGE IS A COMPLETE JOKE AND YOUR EVIL LABORATORIES WILL BE STOPPED::: I WILL GO TO EVERY END I HAVE TO TO SHUT YOUR DOG TORTURING LABS THE HELL DOWN. SO::: TO THE UNIVERSITY AND TO ANYONE WHO IGNORES THE ABUSE AND SICKENING TREATMENT OF THESE LABORATORIES ATTENDING TEXAS A&M::: WHAT YOU ARE DOING IS NO LONGER HIDDEN ::: you are HYPOCRITE “animal lovers” with all of your contradictory posts . WHY DONT YOU LET THE ANIMALS LIVE AND STOP “TAKING IN” NEW ONES WHEN YOURE RUNNING A TORTURE CHAMBER FOR THE BENEFIT OF “science” ??? I WILL NEVER STOP.,"At this time::: 19 dogs from the canine muscular dystrophy (DM) laboratory at Texas A&M University (with at least 12 perfectly healthy and adoptable) remain on its campus::: despite the retirement of the lead experimenter and the fact that the laboratory seems to have little funding for the experiments.

In this laboratory::: golden retrievers and other dogs are deprived of everything that gives meaning to their lives::: as they are trapped in desolate metal cells every day. Dogs affected with canine DM have been subjected to painful and terrifying tests and their health has continually weakened::: to the point where it is difficult for them to even swallow their own saliva. Video footage shows healthy dogs frantically pacing back and forth and chewing on cage bars out of frustration.

It is commendable that in 2019 Texas A&M made the compassionate decision to stop breeding dogs to develop DM. Please continue to do the right thing and use your authority as president to order the release of the surviving dogs so that they can be adopted and live their remaining years in welcoming and loving homes.",Robert Santiago,To the freshman I have watched grow up and have entered this incredible University; blessings.

"Reminder: mandatory COVID-19 testing for all Texas A&M students::: faculty::: and staff — regardless of vaccination status — starts tomorrow::: Aug. 23::: and continues through Sept. 10.

Find additional information and testing locations at tx.ag/GetTestedFall21.",2021-08-22 17:56:18,This is amazing!!! I wish my public school district would do the same. It would significantly cut down on the spread and help us safely remain face to face for instruction.,I’m sure I could find this if I looked closely::: but does anyone know if 100% remote students are required to test? My son is doing an internship in DFW this fall.,"It’s about public health !
Testing continues through Sept. 10::: not a lifetime.
Responsible people making decisions which need to be made. That’s how it works. You will never get 100% consensus on anything it seems.
And yes::: I am fully vaccinated as of April::: 2021.","Thank you Texas A&M University for putting the safety of your Aggie community first. We have a very immunocompromis
ed sibling for our Aggie scholar. It makes our decision to enroll at A&M stronger. Way to set the standard!! Have a great Fall Semester Aggies!!!",Fellow Aggies. Read the attached Covid update. There are no ICU beds in the county. This is not political…it’s a health &safety issue. We all had vaccinations when we were children::: its how we protect each other. I am so proud of Aggieland standing up to ignorance and political bullying. Texas A&M is a university of science and medicine.,How often does someone need to be tested? Can a person test negative and then catch it the next day? Only lasting till 9-10 so all is clear then? This is nothing more than a survey as to the health status of a given population. This is good information to know but usually survey participants volunteer. At least in free countries they do.,As a parent of a sophomore student who does activities such as bon fire::: I’m glad this is happening just as it was done in the spring. It will not stop the spread::: it will not stop these young adults from getting together even with symptoms. However I’d really hate to see another semester of online classes for my engineering student !,Thank you TAMU for making sensible and responsible decisions and practices to protect our community.,Can’t hurt. No one has the exact answers right now. I appreciate she has a place to be tested. Wing and a prayer at this point.,The crowd that crows about individual responsibility seems really averse to responsible action! No surprise really.,The same crowd that doesn’t want people to wear masks::: or take vaccines::: is the same crowd here complaining about testing. It’s a cult of mass death. Glad the university is doing all it can within its legal bounds to address transmission. It would have been a good idea::: however::: to have a more robust online option for students that have to go into quarantine!,While I'm all for vaccines and masks. What's the point of doing a one time test when so many students live off campus and are exposed to so many people.,Thank you being proactive ... while this is not a full on response it is a great start to coming up with steps to keep students and faculty safe.,I'm glad they are treating this as equal for everyone. One of the colleges here is only requiring testing for students who are not vaccinated. They must be tested twice a week. And they are making these students pay for the test at $75 per test::: even though testing is free in NC. The school is not making anyone else get tested::: including faculty and staff whether they are not vaccinated.,Good!!! This will be better than trying to potentially get a bed at the hospital and going through the pain of worrying even more about your student.,"This is fantastic news !! Thank you Texas A & M for caring
for our students and staff !👍🏻👏🏻",This is wonderful. I have three funerals to attend this week alone from Covid deaths. My Dad died in December from Covid too with no health issues. Taking steps to prevent infection isn’t invasive… it may save someone you love. I wish more schools would follow suit.,The university provides free on-campus testing which is fair. We need to protect our students::: faculty::: and families if we will be 100% in-person this Fall.,If you don’t test daily then it’s a waste of time. One test will not do anything except for that day. They could be exposed that evening after testing and become infected and bring it back the next day. Waste of money and time.,This is fruitless::: and here's why. Let's say I'm exposed on Sunday to someone with the disease. The incubation period is about 5 days. So::: I'm exposed on Sunday and test negative on Tuesday::: then Saturday I get sick...,Went for covid-19 test (SBISA Testing Tent) on Wednesday. Haven't received the results so far.,There should be a university wide online option for students who test positive considering they will still be sent home for 2 weeks.,"REMINDER:
If you have Ebola::: Meningitis::: Conjunctivitis:::
Strep Throat::: Measles::: Mumps::: Rubella::: Diphtheria::: Pertussis::: Tuberculosis::: Hepatitis::: Shingles::: MRSA::: Chicken Pox::: or a Cold/Flu/Cough:::
YOU MAY STILL:
Travel::: go to work::: go to school::: go to a restaurant::: go to the gym::: go to a bar::: go to a grocery store::: go to the theater::: and go to a concert.
THAT IS ALL. CARRY ON.",For those who say it's free::: it's really not. I'm sure it's been added to the tuition and fees. Why not text for STD's while you're at it? I think that would be more beneficial to these students.,Where would an Aggie buy stock in the testing company we are using for this ? Asking for a friend!,"Colossal waste of time and money. Can't believe a university does not comprehend that just because you test negative on one day does not mean you will never get it. You would literally have to test everyone on campus every single day for this to be meaningful. And the fact that you have a ""window"" for compliance makes this even more illogical. So you can wander around campus for a couple of days::: maybe pass it to a couple of people::: then go test and now you're banned from campus? What if those people you passed it to already tested negative and now they have it? Common sense is apparently not that common anymore.",Why require those who are not showing any symptoms test? So many professionals have said it can’t be spread asymptotically and advise against testing unless experiencing symptoms!,Super disappointed in my alma mater for this!,"Seems like a CYA move.

“We tested everyone…not our fault”",Go ahead and give cancer screenings also. Maybe prostate exams to. We don’t people to get that stuff either. We’re trying to save lives here.,Bring on the angry::: ignorant comments mostly from people who never went to this school. Kudos to A&M. World class universities don’t ignore scientific reality or not care for the lives of their students and staff.,Can we bring common sense back to the world????? Stop testing people without symptoms. Geez already. Do you go to the doctor to test for the flu or strep without symptoms? No! It's like putting a bandaid on your leg when you're not even bleeding.,So glad I retired last year and don't have to put up with this bullshit.,Testing before school starts is a bit pointless unless you require recurring testing. Not advocating for that::: but nothing will stop the kids from getting it from a non-student and passing it around the student population. I’m not sure the answer but this is not it.,"So let me start by saying this is only a test. No one is asking you to share the results. Whether you agree or disagree...with
this many students in close proximity...I'm
asking what is your solution to the cases that will occur if there is a rise in numbers again after the Fall semester starts???? Offer solutions....no
t complaints. The Delta Variant
Sometimes there are no symptoms...so stop before you say...I don't have any symptoms.",Freaking stupid. I’m glad I graduated back in 2004 when we still had at least a little bit of common sense left.,Thank you for offering the drive thru testing option again::: so quick and convenient!,This is insane. Significant noncompliance is the only way out of this hole. Regents- is this::: along with other recent actions::: what you anticipated with President Kathy Banks? This is seeming more and more like an affirmative action hire.,Really glad I graduated December 19 so I don’t have to deal with all the bullshit you put your students through. Let them be free and experience everything college has to offer.,Get ready for a huge spike in cases (mostly asymptomatic or mild cold symptoms),Why must the test be on campus? What is TAMU going to do with the results? Will the data collected be used in research::: shared with others outside TAMU? Does HIPAA apply?,Hasn't been the same place that i went to in a long time. Feels more like the sips than the Aggies at this point,Although this plan is not perfect::: at least it is a start.,A tent full of coughing and spitting students. Sounds good👍🏻😂,I am a former student and I have to say that this is nonsense and stupid. I urge all my colleagues::: in College Station and abroad::: to push against this madness. Dr. Mazcorro.,I would rather have this than go back to virtual.,How does this even make any sense?,Not that I agree with this whole mess::: but I must say::: this is the first university I've seen that said they will test EVERYONE! Which makes sense if the vaccinated can still get it and spread it,Forced equity with medical procedures is NOT okay!! These kids are not enrolling in a hospital! Stop the madness!!,This should be a choice the student makes not mandated.,So what if little Johnny gets tested on August 23 and is exposed on August 24 / gets COVID? How does the test prevent him from spreading COVID?,Unbelievable as well as unacceptable! If they must::: I’d there an alternative to swabbing?,This is testing::: nothing more::: why would anyone be opposed to knowing if there were sick people sitting next to them in class? I don't think they are requiring vaccinations or masks::: so why all the concern? If there is a move to become less free then there is plenty of time to complain about it. I'm for a reasonable approach to handling this situation::: and yes I believe there is evidence it's a man-made problem. However::: regardless of how it got here::: we have to find a way to control it. That may be vaccines::: it may be herd immunity and it's most likely going to be a combination of both. Let's start with a common sense approach of not putting carriers in classrooms::: then argue the merits of other approaches.,"Pointless.....t
hey would have to test every single day.",I'll be there September 4th untested! Gig 'em Aggies!,Setting the bar Aggies ! Keeping Aggieland safe,Since A&M is so concerned about the students why don't they also require a mandatory negative covid test before coming to football games? Or better yet why not cancel football? The games bring in thousands of people helping to spread covid and putting students at risk. Kyle field won't even be at limited capacity. The mandatory testing is not to keep students safe. If it was A&M would be doing more such as having more options for online classes.,Do you mandate STD screenings too? Or is that a my body::: my choice privacy kind of thing?,Regardless of vaccination status? Ridiculous.,Is it true that if they test positive there’s no online option while they are sick?,Y’all have gone too far. No one should be forced into mandatory testing. This only wastes money and leads to false positives. What happened to the common sense university I attended?,"Our kids had to show proof of the Meningitis B shot before starting A&M.

So I’m assuming that unless there was some medical reason that A&M approved of::: all of your kids got that.

I’ve seen so many people using the excuse that other vaccines like the MB shot were FDA approved and the Covid shot isn’t. But the Pfizer shot is expected to get FDA approval as soon as today.

So then what excuse is next in line?",What happens if a student who lives in the dorm tests positive? Where would they quarantine?,Does anyone have any idea how much Texas A&M will profit from this mandatory test?!,Thank you for putting health & safety first!!!! 👍🏻,I was tested Negative twice::: and both times I was instructed to stay away from everyone or I would get Covid.,If that’s the case::: better offer discounted online classes! You don’t mandate for the flu::: why now this? Someone(s) WILL file lawsuits and win::: fyi,What kind of bull shit is this? Will this be done weekly?,Does this apply to A&M students not in Cstat?

"Two camels named Crimson and Casper are joining the other exotic animals living at the Winnie Carter Wildlife Center::: Texas A&M University on campus!

Crimson has a chronic condition common to camels and will need to be closely monitored. She is joined by her lifelong friend Casper to be cared for by Aggie vets and help Texas A&M College of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences students learn about camel care and medicine.

TODAY.TAMU.EDU
Two Camels Donated To Texas A&M Wildlife Center",2021-08-19 23:56:01,"You can learn more about the Winnie Carter Wildlife Center::: Texas A&M University here: https://
vetmed.tamu.edu/
wildlife/",Years ago I worked very briefly in the large animal clinic of A&M's vet school and regret to this day leaving it for greener pastures::: so to speak.,"Well they will be in great hands at A&M
Those vets are amazing.
Best vet school in the country. 👍
Whoop",While I understand the plight of the dogs::: do you guys have to flood every TAMU posting? This isn't the right forum to complain. You have ways to directly contact the people involved with the dogs. Or contact your political reps.,Shouldn't this have been posted yesterday? (hump day) :),Awesome! Can you tour the Wildlife Center?,Good luck Vets!!!,Them camels are gonna be some good eatin,Helped the wildlife center get over the hump,Cool! I'll be looking for them when I drive by the center on my daily commute.,"From the headline::: I thought ""How much did the camels donate?""",Mike mike mike::: what day is it!?!?!,Not sure about a camel 🐫 named Crimson. Not an Aggie’s favorite color. 😜,Amanda Rae Leal,Koltan Hampton,Hannah Meirink,Anna,Cory Raven,Caring about these camels is great! Are they kept in a metal cage 24/7 and treated like lab equipment? No? Then how can TAMU heartlessly treat 19 dogs so cruelly? Free them to loving homes like you will be someday.,Let's hope the camels have a better life than the dogs held at this university. Please let the dogs go to good homes,Sarah Pyka maybe you’ll get to deal with them,"Dear Dr. Banks:

Right now::: 19 dogs from Texas A&M University’s canine muscular dystrophy (MD) laboratory—12 of whom are perfectly healthy and adoptable—conti
nue to be warehoused on your campus::: despite the retirement of the lead experimenter and the fact that the lab appears to have little funding for experiments.

The golden retrievers and other dogs from this laboratory are deprived of the very things that would make their lives worth living::: as they spend every day stuck in barren metal cells. The dogs suffering from canine MD have undergone painful and terrifying testing::: and their health has steadily deteriorated to the point where it’s difficult for them even to swallow their own saliva. Video footage shows that the healthy ones pace frantically and bite at the bars of their cages in frustration.

It’s commendable that Texas A&M made the compassionate decision to stop breeding dogs to develop MD in 2019. Please do the next right thing and use your authority as president to order the release of the surviving dogs so that they may spend their remaining years in warm::: loving adoptive homes.

Thank you for your consideration of this important matter.",My daughter works there!!,Gig’em Aggies,What about the 19 innocent dogs that you have caged in your phony MD labs that are lonely & tortured?? Do you have any regard or feel any sorrow for the pain & brutality these sweet dogs have endured for years They have lived their life behind these bars Free them so they may enjoy the rest of their short life without inflected pain & terrible suffering🐕🙏💔,Rebecca Kirchhoff wait y’all have camels?!?!?,Lacey Cindy Joelle is this Dr Jensen’s doing?! 👀🐪🤣,How cool is that!!,are you going to torture them like the dogs you keep locked up ?,"PLEASE:::PLEASE:::S
TOP your Animal Testing on innocent Golden Retrievers and other HELPLESS Dogs! PETA and I have been TRYING to STOP THIS for YEARS! PLEASE consider the DOGS! It IS INHUMANE :::and causes SUFFERING.These
experiments do NOTHING for HUMANS.It is senseless CRUELTY.PLEASE STOP! Have a HEART.Gina Tenore-Griffin",Bedawi,Alexis,Kara Cavin,Tristan Lessard,Kevin McCann 😍😍,Please stop experiments on animals & have mercy on all,i would be absolutely ASHAMED to attend this university of which has taken and tortured innocent animals for their benefit. BEAUTIFUL ANIMALS are being TORTURED AND INJECTED AND NOBODY AT YOUR UNIVERSITY CARES? I WOULD BE ASHAMED. YOUR COLLEGE IS A COMPLETE JOKE AND YOUR EVIL LABORATORIES WILL BE STOPPED::: I WILL GO TO EVERY END I HAVE TO TO SHUT YOUR DOG TORTURING LABS THE HELL DOWN. SO::: TO THE UNIVERSITY AND TO ANYONE WHO IGNORES THE ABUSE AND SICKENING TREATMENT OF THESE LABORATORIES ATTENDING TEXAS A&M::: WHAT YOU ARE DOING IS NO LONGER HIDDEN ::: you are HYPOCRITE “animal lovers” with all of your contradictory posts . WHY DONT YOU LET THE ANIMALS LIVE AND STOP “TAKING IN” NEW ONES WHEN YOURE RUNNING A TORTURE CHAMBER FOR THE BENEFIT OF “science” ??? I WILL NEVER STOP.,"Amazing good job! However what about this?

"Aggie students don't have to walk alone!

Learn more about this campus service here: tx.ag/AggieCorpsEscort",2021-08-18 23:30:07,I love the Corps Escorts!! We were so grateful for them back in the 90s when I lived on campus. 💕,"The Corps Escort service is an excellent free resource. It is a part of the great ""Buddy System"" at Texas A&M. I have also utilized this service for a welfare check when my cadet did not respond in a timely fashion to our family's security and welfare check. The Corps Escort service were on it and all was OK. Of course::: the ""Buddy System"" is one of the oldest team building::: personal safety and training mechanisms in our cadet toolboxes. The Corps Escort service is a excellent addition. 👍",Very grateful for corps escort. That's how I found my husband of 15 years. ❤,Thank you so much for this program.

I escorted many ladies - students and faculty - while in the Corps.,Love this::: thank you to the Corp for keeping students safe.,I always studied late and it was nice to not have to walk to my car (all the way at Reed) alone!! Any young lady should use this to have peace of mind walking at night!,That's just awesome. Just one of many reasons Texas A&M is one of the greatest Universities in the world. 😘,I am so glad they have this service but sad that it is needed. We didn’t even dream of needing something like this in the early 70s . CO’75,Please use this. My son is a senior (Zip) in the Corps. He says time goes by much faster when they are on the desk.,"Wonderfully Amazing and Gentlemanly/
Lady-like behaviors!! Y’all are the Best!!!",I’m glad to see this is still a thing. I used this a lot when I was an undergrad.,I lived off campus. After some late::: LATE nights at Evans or the Annex constantly studying::: writing papers::: group work::: etc::: I was always thankful when I could call a cadet to at least walk me to my car. As a freshman::: once my bike chain broke and I had to walk it across campus. The cadet walked nearly the full diagonal across main campus with me::: and stood at the corner of Texas and watched as I got across the road and headed toward my apartment.,I was telling my 16 year old daughter about this service a few weeks ago and wondering if it still existed. She thought it was really neat. Glad it's still going strong!,I’m thankful that we got to experience this awesome university.,I have to laugh remembering when it was my sons turn back in the day ….having to stay up all night on duty!!!!,One of the most comforting things about when my daughter went to TAMU.

Never had to worry about getting to my room or car. Class of ‘92,Yes!! Please use this! My son is a senior in the Corps this year and he always says it makes the night go faster if people utilize them.,Angela Hardwick - I was telling Emily about this. Hope used them several times - especially if she was studying late across campus.,Maybe these fine young people can go release the poor innocent dogs from your evil on campus laboratory!!! Then they can have another thing to be very::: very proud about!,Thank you Corp! As a father I am so glad this available for my daughter to use!,Used sooo much when living on campus in 2008-2009.

I let my daughter go to school there::: and you need an armed escort!!??,This was my favorite part about being a fish in the Corps.,I didn't even know this existed. Such an amazing program.,I remember my fish year::: one of the “perks” of night duty. Always had a pleasant chat on the walk and a smile on my way back to the Quad.,Every Thursday night after dancing I would drive straight to the Corps office and get an escort to drive with me to park my car and walk me back to my dorm.,This service is amazing. I would use it in 96-00 when I was working in the computer lab late and I needed someone to escort me to my car in the parking lot.,Class of ‘95 and appreciated this back then!,This REALLY helps my anxiety as a mother of a daughter who will be starting her Freshman year not knowing anyone. Thank you!!!,Why is it not safe to begin with,"c/o '14

Right now::: 19 dogs from Texas A&M University’s canine muscular dystrophy (MD) laboratory—12 of whom are perfectly healthy and adoptable—conti
nue to be warehoused on your campus::: despite the retirement of the lead experimenter and the fact that the lab appears to have little funding for experiments.

The golden retrievers and other dogs from this laboratory are deprived of the very things that would make their lives worth living::: as they spend every day stuck in barren metal cells. The dogs suffering from canine MD have undergone painful and terrifying testing::: and their health has steadily deteriorated to the point where it’s difficult for them even to swallow their own saliva. Video footage shows that the healthy ones pace frantically and bite at the bars of their cages in frustration.

It’s commendable that Texas A&M made the compassionate decision to stop breeding dogs to develop MD in 2019. Please do the next right thing and use your authority as president to order the release of the surviving dogs so that they may spend their remaining years in warm::: loving adoptive homes.

"Texas A&M announces plans for full-capacity::: in-person classes for the fall semester: tx.ag/UpdateAug521

Considering the continued infection rates::: Texas A&M asks the campus community to do its part by taking important steps to keep Aggieland healthy and safe.

While Texas A&M does not require vaccinations or wearing of masks::: students::: faculty::: & staff are strongly encouraged to get vaccinated::: wear a mask in public indoor settings::: and frequently wash hands.

As we return to campus for the fall::: students::: faculty::: and staff are required to:
- Read and agree to adhere to university guidelines.
- Participate in the mandatory testing program.
- Complete the Texas A&M COVID-19 report form if one tests positive::: shows symptoms::: or has close contact with someone who received a positive test.
- Quarantine if one tests positive or has been identified as a close contact.

Students who have proof of vaccination will be entered into a drawing for one year of undergraduate or graduate tuition and fees. Faculty and staff who have proof of vaccination will also be entered into random drawings for prizes. Complete rules for these drawings will be made available soon.",2021-08-05 18:25:49,Parents - your student is old enough to make the decision on whether or not they get the vaccine. Let them make their own decisions!,"Why are we so quick to incentivize people to take a vaccine. This has never been done in history. Why now 🤔
No one ever puts you in a drawing for childhood vaccines or the flu shot.",Bribes for a healthcare related issue is not a good idea. What a waste of money and effort.,"So glad in person classes are back! My son was not thriving in virtual classes.
Also glad TAMU is leading the way in making choice their policy. 👍💪",I think the options for online should have remained for those who want them. I enjoyed being able to complete my school work and move on with my day. Rather than sit in a classroom no one wanted to be in.,So glad these kids will be back in the classroom where they belong!! Both of my students are excited to be back 👍. Gig’Em 👍,Whew! ALL the Karens came out to play on this post. So excited to see my son head out to College Station in 2 weeks and I'm confident that A&M is doing the things necessary to keep students as safe as possible while returning to some level of normalcy!,People in these comments are so mad that the university is encouraging students to take the free::: safe and effective vaccine. They’re NOT requiring it but people still find ways to get pressed 🤡😂,What a joke. No regard for human life. They would rather please a miserable governor and political party instead of following CDC guidlines.,When is the drawing for showing proof of having the flu vaccine??,Texas A&M University you really need to fix the admissions standards. This comment section alone is proof that your goal of larger attendance numbers is devaluing the degrees of your alumni.,Bribing students with a chance to get free tuition. This sounds like Governor Newsome's California Policy.,Happy we’re taking steps as a university to be safe. Hopefully we will all look out for each other once classes start::: too 👍🏻,So unfortunate that school has to do this to encourage vaccination. Thanks for being creative!,"If the school said you needed the vaccine to attend::: most of you would throw a fit.

If they said they were doing at home learning again::: you’d throw a fit.

If they said they were doing social distancing::: you’d throw a fit.

If they said they were enforcing masks::: you’d throw a fit.

They didn’t say any of those things::: yet you still throw a fit just because they’re offering an incentive for those who choose to help stop the spread by getting the shot.

If you don’t get the shot::: that isn’t taking anything away from you.

It’s like any raffle: you can choose to buy a ticket or not::: only this time that ticket might save lives and help get things back to normal so this insanity can stop.

If the virus starts to spread in high numbers on campus in the unvaccinated population::: things may change::: policies may reverse::: and again::: you won’t be happy.

But::: your body your choice. They aren’t taking that away from you.

Many of us would prefer social distancing and masks::: because even though *we* are protected::: we want those who aren’t vaccinated to *also* be protected::: because we want to stop the spread and stop all people from getting ill or dying.

But most of the comments I’ve seen here from the people who DID get the shot have said “Thank you::: A&M” even though A&M isn’t doing everything they wish they’d do::: because we see that at least the school is doing something.

For some of you::: nothing will ever make you happy.","So it now looks like Texas A&M will take on the responsibility(
financially and Medically) for these non approved experimental vaccines student and facility receive? since the pharmacutical companies refuse to be held accountable for any adverse issues with this! Do your homework peeps ! You brilliant ones who approved of this ....obvioulsy YOU need to go back to school and get a better education.....O
r are you Being Financially compensated by someone or some organization that you all agreed to this ? Make your own informed decisions Aggies .",Should just require it or at least require it once it has full FDA approval. The only thing different about this vaccine and the others already required is politics.,Please please release the remaining dogs so they can live the rest of their lives in a loving home.thry should not be locked up,"TAMU has for years required the meningitis vaccine of all freshmen. Covid in classrooms is no different. https://
admissions.tamu.
edu/meningitis",If one is not symptomatic::: why test????,Great job::: Aggies - especially considering all the restraints put on you by the governor's office. Your options were few::: and no doubt by this time next month::: there will be lots of casualties. Hopefully this will encourage vaccinations.,I thought my alma mater was better than stooping to bribery!!!! Y’all are embarrassing me right now! #SMH,If someone has to quarantine::: do they have the option of online classes? Or do they miss 2 weeks of school?,Whoa::: what about grad students? Why discriminate against grad students? Shouldn’t they also be included in the drawing if they can show proof of vaccination?,Glad the students will be back in person? 👏👏👏👏,It would be better for the school to require the vaccine for attendance.,Wonder when the black market vaccination cards will be available?,So you’re incentivizing people to potentially disregard doctor’s medical advice by getting vaccine? Not cool,Bribery. That's where it's at. Love it.,Get the vaccine so we can be done with this already.,Don't make a suckers bet::: get vaccinated. The odds are overwhelming. Ask any doctor or gambler,If it’s such a great product::: why are you having to bribe people to get it? This is ridiculous. And the ONLY reason you’re not requiring it or masks is because you CAN’T. Sad to know my school is not very big on freedom or personal choice.,Why is everyone pushing this shot with incentives?,Hoping to see A&M shift on this as vaccines become FDA approved.,Why should free tuition and fees be possibly given just for getting vaccinated?,At Texas A&M::: we have this thing called a spine::: and we aren't afraid to use it,When you have to bribe people to do something that tells me something is not right somewhere.,So glad they get to go back to campus!,"So now we are Longhorns?
Last time I checked (and I went to Texas A&M University not long ago) we were a conservative institution) but I guess we just all assimilate into the “keep your friends close and your enemies closer” mentality! Gig’em Longhorns 😂",Free tuition. How awesome is that. Way to go Ags!,At least mask and vaccines are optional!,I prefer you require it if all who are medically able to get it.

That was a blast!!!!!!!,Whoop !,Can't wait to see it!,So cool!!!!,WHOOP!!!,"At Texas A&M University::: experimenters bred golden retrievers to develop canine muscular dystrophy (MD). This disease ravages their bodies::: causing progressive muscle wasting and weakness. To gauge just how much a dog’s muscles have deteriorated::: experimenters invented a crude technique that could pass for medieval torture: They repeatedly stretch them with a motorized lever in order to cause muscle tears.
Dogs who didn’t have the disease but carried the MD gene were used for breeding. Deprived of loving homes::: they frantically paced across the slatted floors and bit the bars of the small cages in frustration. They didn’t even have the comfort of a blanket.
Forty years of experiments on dogs have failed to produce a cure or even a treatment to reverse MD symptoms in humans.
Following an intensive PETA campaign::: in 2019 Texas A&M bowed to pressure and permanently ended its MD laboratory dog-breeding program. The lab appears to have little funding for experiments::: and a number of dogs have been released for adoption. Sadly::: others have died without ever knowing the love and comfort of a home.

Peter Nghiem::: the laboratory’s lead experimenter::: has publicly claimed that healthy dogs are adopted out after he’s finished using them. This is a lie. Three such dogs remain in barren metal cages in Nghiem‘s lab. Nine others were transferred to another Texas A&M laboratory::: including Cannoli::: who had initially been put up for adoption. But he was betrayed by the school when he was transferred to the second lab.
It’s apparent that::: rather than admitting defeat::: the school prefers to warehouse 19 dogs::: even though PETA has offered to take all of them.",Please close the laboratory::: release all dogs from this lab for adoption into good homes::: and redirect resources toward humane research methods.,"https://

SEC Extends Membership Invitations to University of Oklahoma and University of Texas",2021-07-29 21:33:22,tu is a shadow of who they were when we left the Big 12. It's going to take YEARS for them to get back to relevance::: IF their boosters can stick with one coach for long enough for him to get his own recruits in. They've shown no patience for that. Their boosters want to win NOW::: which just won't happen if they're changing coaches every 3-4 years. Especially with a coach like Steve Sarkisian::: who is more likely to fall off the wagon (again) than to lead tu to a major bowl game. Yes::: this is more than a football move::: but let's be real. Football is the driving force behind it. A&M's dominance of the Texas recruiting scene is safe for a while.,"Nice job by our administration of protection or interests. There are going to be some ""spicey"" conversations when the TMF makes their annual calls soliciting donations.",Hahaha. I remember all the shit Texas laid on A&M when they joined the SEC. Can’t wait for Alabama to greet Texas with a hardy hello.,"What a great idea! We should abstain. 13-0 vote. Perfect. If my memory is correct::: t.u.’s mascot Bevo::: came from a 13-0 brand.

“The vote on Thursday should be unanimous 14-0 for OU and if the vote is unanimous for tu::: A&M should abstain. A 13-0 vote would be kind of ironic. (Anyone who knows A&M football history will understand the reference). In 1915 A&M shutout Texas at Kyle field 13-0 and in 1917 a group of cadets at A&M branded Bevo with the score.”

As if this school needs money though. Disappointing.",Well this just goes with the times. Watch. There will be a movement to change our fight song. Fly a tu flag at Kyle. Coom by ya. Forget how we were treated. Forget there was NEVER a tu NCAA investigation. But::: what does it matter with NCAA leaving::: super conferences entering::: and advertising coming beyond what we know. Cant wait to see an Austin game. They will have re-funded their police by then::: right? Here comes the slurs::: jokes::: our band and school are a cult::: we are fascists::: and on. Oh joy. I said it before I identify as a pre-2020 Aggie.,Well so much for everyone assuming we were gonna veto and not let tu in.,"Do I want tsips to languish in the Little 12(10)? Absolutely.

Do I also want to clobber them at Kyle Field on Thanksgiving? Absolutely.

So y’all vote how ever::: but I’m just gonna go ahead and set a google alert for them tickets two years from now 😉",That’s nice of us. We broke up long ago and now they wanna get back together. Just as long as everyone knows they came to us::: asking to be let back in the house.,"I see a lot of good points here (and hear many good reasons in the media) to go along with this expansion::: play the game and not lose face::: and to let our performance on the field speak for itself. Others still say it's really about the money and you're just not going to be able to go against that. Many also say we have to look at this with the view that it is a different day and TU won't be able to get away with their drama and scheming in the SEC. I hope I'm wrong but admitting Texas may very well be the beginning of the end of the SEC. I have no problem admitting OU. Bring them in and if we want to be the first superconference
with 16 teams let's shop around for the other. The point that concerns me and which I think most of the SEC schools that haven't had to deal with TU are missing is that TU is like a cancer when it comes to getting their way or eventually being in control. At the outset they won't be able to really cause problems; but they'll persist::: and maneuver::: and politic::: and scheme until over time they get to that position of being in control. Once they do they'll start fracturing the conference just like in the Southwest Conference and just like the Big 12. It'll take them years to do it but they'll try and keep trying. When and if they succeed then teams will start looking to get away again and the conference will fracture. I hope I'm wrong but it's a real possibility with them. That said... every game we face them in better be us winning by a blow out that reminds them why we left and they should never have followed us to the SEC. They want to come play here after us then we better make them feel it and regret it. Gig'Em.",Remember when they were wanting to change the name of Kyle Field to the house that Johnny built? That didn’t happen because former students called and flooded the phone lines of the board of regents. I say we do it again if we aren’t in favor of this.,A&M is in a much better place now than they were a decade ago. The real insanity is whoever at UT was convinced by their arch nemesis (OU) to go along with said arch nemesis to the SEC where they can continue to struggle against OU and then also get to struggle against A&M::: Alabama::: LSU::: Georgia….(list goes on). Also voting “no” would imply fear. Let us not forget the one time we met either team in nearly a decade on the football field::: OU was smoked by a guy called Johnny Football on national television. Johnny aside::: this is a far better holistic program now than even then.,"Spent over 100 years to get away from t.u.’s drama::: and TAMU has done just fine. The horns have such a high opinion of themselves and manage to screw up everything they touch because of their greed. It’s been nice not having to listen to their hot air::: and knowing that whatever they did wouldn’t affect us. No amount of money can be worth having to deal with that crap.

Grow a pair and speak your mind::: and/or consider the voice of the thousands of Aggies whom I know would oppose this.",Being the only SEC team considering blocking the inevitable makes us look scared::: whether we are or not. Let them put it out on the field and see.,Freaking washouts. It isn’t being afraid of the sips. Who would be? It was just not having to deal with their bs::: ego::: and arrogance. Creating own own path::: brand::: destiny. And just like that::: not even ten years later::: A&M leadership gives in to taking them back. Disgusting. Weak.,So how much did ESPN pay for that vote?,"Wow…..disappoin
ted! Way to water down a great conference with some classless schools.",What!?? Let them stay in the Big 12. I think everyone forgets what Texas said when the Aggies left the Big 12. I guess we are taking the high ground. I still think it is a mistake.,I really don’t want this. The SEC west is essentially going to become THE Super Conference. Good for us::: I guess::: but I still want tu and ou to fade away with the mess of the Big “12”,That moment you realize that you care more about school pride and tradition than the institute itself because you’re not the one that has compromised those things for the dollar.,"So....between blm and the teasips....I have justification to not send the university any donations until the 2030's.....does
not seem like a really wise plan....",With the latest TI lawsuit from the BIG XII ::: against ESPN ::: the SEC & the AAC brakes need to be applied …,Wait for a couple of years and tu will be wanting to drive the bus. Just wait!,Why?! This is awful move. We will once again have to compete with Texas for recruits and live under their shadow. It was fun while it lasted. So disappointing.,Please abstain. As someone posted in another group (I don’t remember who or what group or I would totally give credit where it’s due)::: having the vote be 13-0 would make a much bigger statement. #13-0 #sawemoff,So much for that “Gentleman’s Agreement” Bowtie was talking about 🙄,I guess it's a classy move not to fight expansion but it really will come back to haunt A&M. Yeah the bump in revenue is the only reason for this decision like everything else but losing the SEC recruiting advantage will be a much bigger loss.,Didn't we leave because of UT? What gives? Did I miss something?,"We beat up both t. u. and Oklahoma with our total and complete advantage recruiting with the SEC. We know it and they know it. Which is why they want in. To stop that advantage.
It’s not about the money. It’s about destroying that advantage. Plain and simple. It will affect us if we don’t continue to win.",Blindsided and then strong-armed.,The big 12 be dropping lawsuits time meow!,What? Why on gods green earth would you do this?! You have to stand for what you believe in. No confidence.,"""Today the Board received the information it needed to properly consider the long-term ramifications of a possible expansion...""= $$$$$$$ 😖 Yep::: open the door and let those t-sips sh*t on everything once again. Talk is cheap. Nice going::: dudes.",At least get a written document affirming that Texas will not be allowed to get a cut of the SEC money at anytime while receiving money from the LHN or any other payments associated with it. The opportunity to double dip is a possibility as long as there is a LHN contract with espn. Espn could even cancel the LHN and still pay Texas the balance of the contract.,This is terrible and will come back to haunt us. Need to investigate who the regent members are.,"I am a LSU alumnus and have two children and a grandson that are Aggies. However::: I say ""Why weaken a good thing"". The SEC has done well enough the way it is. UT and OU deserve to flounder in the so call ""Big 12"".","Why did they not go ""no vote"" and make it 13-0????

(True Ags get it)","When we finally got rid of the toxic ex and they just showed back up at a bar and you say “this time will be different” 😐😡

It’s been so nice without Texas and their bandwagon fans.",More respect for standing up for what you really think instead of caving. Spineless is right. Not a good look. Everyone knows we aren’t for this.,"So disappointed in A&M caving to tu once again...I thought A&M had moved on but apparently our ""leaders"" love tu being in charge. I guess we can look forward to Florida State and Clemson joining next. Pretty soon we can just have the minor league NFL divided into the afc minor league and the nfc minor league. To heck with collegiate sports and bowl games. Money improved sports and now has corrupted sports.",I will be surprised if they come before 2025. Feel pretty sure they don’t want to play SEC teams in their current condition. Bet their new coach wants all that time to get them good enough to compete in the SEC. It would be a miracle if they came next year and won any games unless they can control who the referees are.,"What a joke. We're going to end up with two ""conferences"" just like NFL::: MLB::: etc.

College ball is better than this garbage...",Sad damn day in Texas A&M history books where we went to the rescue to save a dying program that quite honestly deserves every bit of rejection NCAA wide....BTHO Texas tho GIGEM,The people that should be really upset are the schools that OU and t.u. are leaving behind. They're really screwed.,Our chancellor John Sharp is a Democrat. Yes he’s an Aggie too but…..,They were told to invite them by the SEC. There was never an actual option here. No matter how you feel about it::: at least be honest.,So what this article says (but doesn’t say) is that the SEC said it’s going to shill out an obscene amount of money to the university and has nothing to do with football,There’s no way we could have voted against it… It was going to pass and if we if had been the only one to vote against it we would have looked terrible and definitely would have appeared scared. Exciting times!!! Let’s get ready to “Saw ‘Em Off” … Again!,Sell outs. I don’t care if you stand alone and vote no but you should vote no and standup for the institution even if you know you won’t stop them from getting in. Don’t come calling the the former students in 10 years when this blows up.,"It was going to happen. The Longhorn 10 has been leaking water for a while.
The question is do they expand and add 4 teams or
is it as in the past “every man for himself “. BTHO everyone!",A terrible decision. The University of Texas at Austin’s Athletic Department is poison.,I’m still wondering why Texas wants to add 2 - 3 more losses to their season...,Here's my thought on it ::: ou plays bama::: loses by 31.. plays allburn loses by 24::: plays A&M loses by 29..( end of the season we don't know what happened it's a building year ) hahahaha,"Spineless and short-sighted.
We already know what type of business partner the burnt orange is::: so it's extremely stupid to be willingly crawling back into bed with them",Disgusting! Anyone in favor of this needs their head examined. The sips have destroyed every athletic conference they have ever been a part of::: by their own hand. They will lie::: they will cheat::: they will steal::: they will make guarantees and then stab you in the back::: and they will always demand more than their share. And they will always have their fans wearing stripes making the important calls. They are a psychotic::: manipulative::: abusive ex::: who has seen us become more successful than them::: so now they want back in our lives. Anyone with the best interest of Texas A&M in mind would fight like hell to keep this from happening. But I guess the espn bribe money is too much to say no to. Hopefully the Big 12 lawyers who have already caught espn meddling will be able to get it stopped.,Bring it on. tu will not run anything in the SEC. They had to beg and bring their so called rival with them to get in. 😂,I say bring on Texas and OU. Let's renew our rivalry with Texas. They both Texas and OU will have to beat everyone else just like we have to.,Gig’em! Going to be a great schedule!,What happened? Their mascot Reveille buried their spines in the backyard or something?,"Governor Coke - "" ... Be as true to a trust reposed as the needle to the pole::: stand by the right even...
.
.
Aw never mind. Show me the money.""",I think this will put pressure on recruiting in Texas as the SEC is a better glide path to the NFL than the big 12. Okl and UT will now have a better chance to recruit top Texas high school talent. It will bring more tradition to an already tradition steeped SEC and that translates to even bigger audiences and pay days. I think $ talked to a great degree and also some collegial political correctness. As a SEC transplant TAMU had a leg up in Texas high school recruiting. Now that goes away so it seems to be a trade off of recruiting for $ and some nice nice between university presidents.,I can see some conditions that Texas A&M got. Like not playing t.u. every year but every 2 or 4 years. First game at Kyle Field. No more LHN.,Here is the difference. All teams in SECs reap the money where big 12 the profit sharing was not equal,Alabama votes no. Not enough of a challenge from t.u.,Beat the hell outa tu and everyone else in the SEC! Game on!!! Fightin Texas Aggie Class of 92!,Sorry::: I think if 3 other teams votes before A&M and says no. I feel we will vote no too.,No. They voted for the $$$$,"Trevor Burt Alabama’s biggest competitor recruiting wise is TU. Alabama gets their players by winning in the SEC. Other teams in the SEC get picked as their go-to be in the SEC. With TU joining the SEC::: recruitment and all their Walmart fans will lead the SEC. Maybe not this year::: but in the following for sure.

(And Walmart fans as in majority of TU fans aren’t Alum::: it’s people who buy that shit orange t-shirts at Walmart and talk like they’re the best.)

SEC is better than including TU into their conference. Too much drama with their sensitive asses. But::: we will see.","It may well indeed have been a 13 - 1 vote::: and perhaps OU and Texas get admitted anyway. But A&M doesn't have to be an accomplice.

The school likes to say it stands for something::: and it is clear to all what that something is. Whores::: the lot of them (except Mike Hernandez. Good for him).",Why would anyone in Texas go to OU when they could go to tu or TAMU? 🤷‍♂️,Let’s do it! We’re so far ahead of that program::: hoping they get this done by the ‘22 season. They won’t be able to push the SEC around like they did the big xii... little brother following big brother to the adults table. Times have changed. BTHO tu,This will doom the SEC. Woke bs will kill it within 10 years.,Thats fine. When we lose recruits to the other SEC Texas school::: and we are below .500 on the field::: we don’t want to hear any crying. We don’t want phone calls begging us to renew season tickets. You made your bed.,It’s all about the $$$,Geeze... did anyone say no?,GOOD!!! Bring ‘Em on!!! Enough of the “Aggies are scared of tu & OU.”,Does it really matter?,"https://

I may have left Aggieland but will never forget and always love this school and town!,Is it also a beautiful day for the dogs you keep at captivity at your campus? Please help them to get adopted before all of them die. Universities are built to bring enlightenment::: not torture to innocent animals. Use other means for your research::: you live in a highly developed society. Use artificial intelligence::: use volunteering humans.

Stop the torture. Free the dogs to good homes. Stop experimenting and torturing animals.,"Say Howdy with a deep apology to the dogs Texas A&M tortures. Appalling::: cruel::: inhumane and useless science. This is not ""higher education"". To gauge just how much a dog’s muscles have deteriorated::: experimenters invented a crude technique that could pass for medieval torture: They repeatedly stretch them with a motorized lever in order to cause muscle tears.

Dogs who didn’t have the disease but carried the MD gene were used for breeding. Deprived of loving homes::: they frantically paced across the slatted floors and bit the bars of the small cages in frustration. They didn’t even have the comfort of a blanket.

Forty years of experiments on dogs have failed to produce a cure or even a treatment to reverse MD symptoms in humans.

Following an intensive PETA campaign::: in 2019 Texas A&M bowed to pressure and permanently ended its MD laboratory dog-breeding program. The lab appears to have little funding for experiments::: and a number of dogs have been released for adoption. Sadly::: others have died without ever knowing the love and comfort of a home. (Read more here.)

Peter Nghiem::: the laboratory’s lead experimenter::: has publicly claimed that healthy dogs are adopted out after he’s finished using them. This is a lie. Three such dogs remain in barren metal cages in Nghiem‘s lab. Nine others were transferred to another Texas A&M laboratory::: including Cannoli::: who had initially been put up for adoption. But he was betrayed by the school when he was transferred to the second lab.

It’s apparent that::: rather than admitting defeat::: the school prefers to warehouse 19 dogs::: even though PETA has offered to take all of them.",Please close the laboratory::: release all dogs from this lab for adoption into good homes::: and redirect resources toward humane research methods.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Texas A&M Office of the President
July 24 at 3:49 PM ·

A statement from Texas A&M University President M. Katherine Banks on Southeastern Conference expansion: tx.ag/Banks0724",2021-07-24 21:50:42,Most useless statement ever...,Wow. That is about as informative as a WH press conference,Let me interpret: OU and tu are joining the SEC against the wishes of Texas A&M. We threw a fit::: they won::: get over it.,Don't get me wrong::: I'd love to see a rivalry game again::: but a huge reason we went to the SEC was to get away from the sips' domineering influence in the Big 12. They dug their own graves::: so I say let 'em burn. Let them go independent or join the PAC-12 or Big 10.,"That was a pathetic statement::: ""Psaki-esk""!!!",A statement that says absolutely nothing.,All they have to do is go back and look at email where this so-called gentlemen's agreement was discussed. That makes it a little more weightier::: and A & M may have the legal standing to say no. Now::: if somebody will get on the phone too these other institutions such as Florida and Georgia and tell them that their Rivals could petition to join the SEC without restriction they may have second thoughts about what their vote might be,"That is::: without a doubt::: the biggest waste of a press release in the history of useless statements.

I learned nothing from that statement and might actually be dumber for having read it!","My interpretation:
a lot of words to say 1) we are indeed in the loop on the conversations and 2) we are not going to run to another conference because we are pissed off. We are going to stay in the SEC.","Aggies::: We hope you are successful.

Signed
Your old rival Tech",Weak non-statement. Bring back Loftin!,Georgia SEC….not happy about expansion…,That was a Gettysburg address. Sheesh. Hissss. Sounds like the political bs I am for the bill but if asked I would vote against it. A new politician Prez without Aggies interests emerging? When did you know? Waiting.,Better be a no vote if you truly have the Ag’s best interest.,This is the most non-statement statement.,Yep. A true administrator. Lots of word with no significant meaning.,Well that was a waste of a statement- saying nothing would have been better. 🤦🏼‍♀️,That said nothing. Once again week ass crap from a president,How to say something without having to say something.,Keep fighting Aggies. As a Tech fan this is a do or die moment for us.,We’ll::: that’s about as milk toast as you can get….,Where was there anything concerning expansion in that statement???,I never knew it was possible to write that many words without saying anything.,Translation: This is happening.,That statement was a whole lot of nothing.,That’s it?,horns down,This is a chickenshit worthless statement. Is Jen Psaki writing press releases for TAMU now?,I am proud Aggie and I miss playing OU and tu every year. why the president of tamu is putting out this non-statement and not looking forward to the challenge of our old foes joining was a missed opportunity.,"Embrace the change.
Anything other than that gives the appearance:::
That you're afraid of UT.
Texas A&M is a brand in and of itself.
I'm a USC guy here in
Los Angeles.
Texas A&M sells itself.
As a veteran:::
I love all you stand for.
#GigEm👍🏼",As I hear it::: it is just a matter of when. Why would anyone object making the best conference in the land even better. I think there is more than one team in the SEC that blows::: but::: hey::: embrace it and love it. Now::: they will get a chance at big boy football.,"It is was it is…. Lots of big business::: politics & money involved in these type of decisions.

But if we’re back in the same conference with tu::: this renewed rivalry just got way more intense.",This is going to be funny. Watch Alabama::: Texas A&M::: or LSU keep them from ever bubbling up to the top.,Shades of Elsa Murano,Until there is a real 16 team playoff::: someone is going to get screwed. You think the Big10::: PAC12 and ACC are going to stand for 3-4 SEC teams in a 4 team CFP?,Let’em in::: Good for State of Texas,I’m an Aggie Mom::: and Sooners wife!!! I will support both team equally.🏈🏈,People bitched when A&M made the move. Remember it's all about the money. Nothing else matters,It's like they left the filler and forgot the statement.,Are you kidding me? She is wasting her time on this? <snort>,"There's a non-statement if I ever heard one.
No to texas and OU!",What else are they going to say and still be diplomatic? Muster the votes to block admission. And if that fails::: beat the hell outta tu.,"How embarrassing to let a team into the SEC that passes anti-taunting rules that only benefit themselves.....
a team that is offended by their own school song. Not SEC quality. The correct response would have been ""NUTS!"" (WWII history buffs will understand that.)",So she's not telling?,"I hope nobody decides to plagiarize this::: lol 🤣🤣🤣 They will get an ""F Minus"" for a grade.","Comment: Croz Logic on ""Hatin'::: just on another level""....

So::: Texas A&M is having a ""Marsha::: Marsha::: Marsha"" moment as it is low key trying to block UT's transfer to the SEC.
Look::: I get it..... A&M is the Chrysler 300 with a Roll Royce Grill.and it looks fine...
UNTIL A REAL ROLLS ROYCE PHANTOM (UT) PULLS UP NEXT TO IT!🤔
#StopHatinA&M",Usually a statement says something.,"this vifeo the funniest thing I have ever seen... glad A&M regents finally pulled up their big boy pants. https://

"The late Betty Miller Unterberger made history in 1968 as Texas A&M's first female professor! During her 36 year career she excelled in the history department at Texas A&M Liberal Arts::: and helped students realize their full potential.

Dr. Unterberger was a path-breaker in her profession::: led her students by example::: and always made it known that she loved the Aggies.

Remembering Texas A&M's First Female Professor - Texas A&M Today",2021-07-13 23:50:39,She was a class act👍.I enjoyed her history class even though I was no history scholar.. but moreso I admired the example she provided as a strong::: capable woman who could easily hold her own in any circle of men or women.,I had Dr. Unterberger for a senior history class. From the first day of class to the last::: I was mesmerized by her vast knowledge and memorable presence (for lack of a better word). I still remember much of what she taught as well as the classroom techniques she employed. She truly was one of the best profs I had at A&M. Gig 'em::: Class of '72!,"I might be wrong::: but I thought Dr Meta Brown from the Dept of Soil and Crop Science was first.
Nevertheless::: Dr Unterberger deserves our respect for her service to TAMU.",I was privileged to take classes from her as I was getting my History degree - Class of “76 - lots of changes were occurring at A&M in the 70s - coed dorm::: women in the Corps etc. She was a wonderful role model and I loved her classes.,"Took her Foreign Relations class - probably my favorite class all 4 years! Amazing professor……here
.",It’s commendable that Texas A&M made the compassionate decision to stop breeding dogs to develop MD in 2019. Please do the next right thing and use your authority as president to order the release of the surviving dogs so that they may spend their remaining years in warm::: loving adoptive homes.,On my Masters committee::: fabulous educator and an inspiration.,I took several courses under Dr. Unterberger. She was a fantastic teacher::: and I was honored that she was on my master's committee. She and Dr. Arnold Krammer were my academic heroes.,She was my U.S. History prof. I loved her class and learned so much yet took so few notes because I was so busy listening::: thinking::: and analyzing.,I took HIST106 from Dr. Unterberger in 1998. She was a wonderful professor and I greatly enjoyed conducting research on the Cuban Missile Crisis under her direction using newly released documents. She will be missed.,One of my favorite professors - learned so much about cold War policy and being a strong leader as a woman,My Fish Camp was Camp Unterberger! I wish I had taken at least one of her classes.,Her class was one the hardest I ever took- but it made a lasting impression. Here!,Sad. RIP,Dr. Unterberger was such an amazing professor. Taking her Western Civ class in the mid 90s is one of my favorite memories from A&M.,Took Russian history from her. She was awesome!,Here,Here.,George Stuart West: we were there!,Here,Here,HERE,If she was so great she would of stopped this sh*t hole from testing and breeding dogs with muscular dystrophy a long time ago. 50 years of abusing animals is enough don’t you think? 🙄,Gig’em Aggie,It really took until 1968?,I was there.

There is a story that during the 1976 bicentennial::: A&M loaned the bell back to the Texas capital but the clapper was missing. The call went out far and wide until a woman in Bryan called the campus to say she thought the clapper was in a tree in her back yard. The clapper was restored and after the bicentennial ceremonies the bell was returned to the Academic Building.

Maybe someone can confirm if this is just good bull or the truth probably the result of a fish prank.","WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!

k","At Texas A&M University::: experimenters bred golden retrievers to develop canine muscular dystrophy (MD). This disease ravages their bodies::: causing progressive muscle wasting and weakness.
Video footage shows that the appallingly thin dogs in the laboratory were caged::: sometimes alone::: in barren metal cells and struggled to swallow thin gruel—the only food that they could eat::: given how easily they could choke. Long ropes of saliva hung from the mouths of those whose jaw muscles had weakened. Even balancing was difficult. Dogs with this condition are also at great risk of contracting pneumonia because they can easily inhale liquid. To gauge just how much a dog’s muscles have deteriorated::: experimenters invented a crude technique that could pass for medieval torture: They repeatedly stretch them with a motorized lever in order to cause muscle tears.
Dogs who didn’t have the disease but carried the MD gene were used for breeding. Deprived of loving homes::: they frantically paced across the slatted floors and bit the bars of the small cages in frustration. They didn’t even have the comfort of a blanket.
Forty years of experiments on dogs have failed to produce a cure or even a treatment to reverse MD symptoms in humans.",I urge the new president to close the laboratory::: release all dogs from this lab for adoption into good homes::: and redirect resources toward humane research methods.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

#GigEm",2021-07-04 13:33:00,Andrea Missildine can you believe it’s been 20 years?! We should get the new shirts!,Would proudly support the effort but not willing to pay almost $10.00 shipping. Sorry.,I hope people pause to remember not only the majesty of that game::: the significance of such solidarity in the face of a changed world::: and the charity that followed thanks to thousands of generous donations - but also the sheer will::: grit and Aggie Spirit it took to accomplish that game in 2001. There was no Facebook. No Instagram. Email was slow and chained to our desks::: back at our dorms and in our computer labs. No Twitter. No group texts. The magnificence of the 9/22/01 game was the result of pure word of mouth. Friends telling friends. Aggies feeling emotional and helpless in the face of evil::: but wanting to make a difference. In a week’s time::: it went from an idea to a mark on TAMU history. I am incredibly proud to be married to one of the five Aggies who saw the idea through to fruition::: with the help of so many others. Please remember all the former students and members of the B/CS community who worked tirelessly toward that goal::: before “like and share” was an option. Gig ‘em and God Bless Texas A&M!,I had a white one.,Proudly wore my redshirt to that game. It’s going to be pretty moving to see this repeated. 🇺🇸,I think I just got rid of my original one.

After entering a boat::: Jesus made the crossing::: and came into his own town.
And there people brought to him a paralytic lying on a stretcher.
When Jesus saw their faith::: he said to the paralytic:::
“Courage::: child::: your sins are forgiven.”
At that::: some of the scribes said to themselves:::
“This man is blaspheming.”
Jesus knew what they were thinking::: and said:::
""Why do you harbor evil thoughts?
Which is easier::: to say::: ‘Your sins are forgiven:::’
or to say::: ‘Rise and walk’?
But that you may know that the Son of Man
has authority on earth to forgive sins”–
he then said to the paralytic:::
“Rise::: pick up your stretcher::: and go home.”
He rose and went home.
When the crowds saw this they were struck with awe
and glorified God who had given such authority to men.

Evangelio

Mt 9:::1-8

En aquel tiempo::: Jesús subió de nuevo a la barca::: pasó a la otra orilla del lago y llegó a Cafarnaúm::: su ciudad.

En esto::: trajeron a donde él estaba a un paralítico postrado en una camilla. Viendo Jesús la fe de aquellos hombres::: le dijo al paralítico: “Ten confianza::: hijo. Se te perdonan tus pecados”.

Al oír esto::: algunos escribas pensaron: “Este hombre está blasfemando”. Pero Jesús::: conociendo sus pensamientos::: les dijo: “¿Por qué piensan mal en sus corazones? ¿Qué es más fácil: decir ‘Se te perdonan tus pecados’::: o decir ‘Levántate y anda’? Pues para que sepan que el Hijo del hombre tiene poder en la tierra para perdonar los pecados::: –le dijo entonces al paralítico–: Levántate::: toma tu camilla y vete a tu casa”.

El se levantó y se fue a su casa. Al ver esto::: la gente se llenó de temor y glorificó a Dios::: que había dado tanto poder a los hombres.",Thought that was Steven Hering for a sec.

Your word says in James 5:15 that “a prayer offered in faith will heal the sick::: and the Lord will make you well”. Thank You! That truth can be so hard to remember::: especially in the middle of an illness. Help Coach Slocum::: his friends::: his family::: and the entire extended Aggie family::: hold tight to that promise.
God::: we humbly come before You to lift Coach Slocum up to You in prayer::: and boldly ask for that kind of healing over him::: a miraculous healing. Thank You for being the Ultimate Healer::: and thank You for the healing you provide through physicians::: treatments::: and medical interventions. We pray for his entire medical team::: both at MD Anderson and in College Station. God::: please guide them toward the best treatments for Coach Slocum in this moment::: as well as in the future. We ask for Coach Slocum’s healing to be quick::: pain-controlled
::: and complete.
Thank you::: Lord::: for hearing our prayers::: both spoken and unspoken. And thank You for The Holy Spirit’s ability to intercede and pray for us when we don’t know what we should pray for. Thank You::: again::: God::: for loving us completely and unconditionally
. Thank You for all that You do::: but more importantly for who You are.
It is in Jesus’ Precious and Holy Name we pray.

There’s nothing quite like the timeless view down Old Main in the summer.,2021-06-21 17:14:00,It's so beautiful. We really enjoyed our trip a few weeks ago💕,I walked that route every day one summer from the Academic Bldg where I worked to West Campus for a class and then back to the Academic Bldg to work the rest of the day. This was before the tunnels. I would get stuck twice a week or more waiting on a train to pass in the July heat. Grasshoppers the size of small helicopters would buzz me and sometimes stick to my shirt. Fun times!,Please release the 20 dogs being held captive in your laboratories 💔,My favorite view on campus!,Such a nice campus! I hope they keep it that way::: and visible!,"I much prefer the view from inside the student center. It's air-conditioned

Please shut down this dog laboratory! No dog deserves to live this way💔","At Texas A&M University::: experimenters bred golden retrievers to develop canine muscular dystrophy (MD). This disease ravages their bodies::: causing progressive muscle wasting and weakness.
Video footage shows that the appallingly thin dogs in the laboratory were caged::: sometimes alone::: in barren metal cells and struggled to swallow thin gruel—the only food that they could eat::: given how easily they could choke. Long ropes of saliva hung from the mouths of those whose jaw muscles had weakened. Even balancing was difficult. Dogs with this condition are also at great risk of contracting pneumonia because they can easily inhale liquid. To gauge just how much a dog’s muscles have deteriorated::: experimenters invented a crude technique that could pass for medieval torture: They repeatedly stretch them with a motorized lever in order to cause muscle tears.
Dogs who didn’t have the disease but carried the MD gene were used for breeding. Deprived of loving homes::: they frantically paced across the slatted floors and bit the bars of the small cages in frustration. They didn’t even have the comfort of a blanket.
Forty years of experiments on dogs have failed to produce a cure or even a treatment to reverse MD symptoms in humans.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"In observance of the national holiday of Juneteenth::: The Texas A&M University System has announced that Texas A&M University will be closed Friday::: June 18::: and classes and work are canceled.

New Student Conferences and summer camps will resume as normal. More information is available at tx.ag/Juneteenth21.",2021-06-17 23:22:06,Excellent leadership. Thank you A&M for demonstrating your patriotism and leadership.,Class of '77 is proud to be an Aggie,Wow::: I’m surprised they implemented this so fast! Good on them. Saved me from taking a calculus exam 🤣,For those of you complaining that A&M doesn’t close for Labor Day or other federal and state holidays::: the reason is because state employees are allowed a certain number of holidays each year. If A&M observed all of them there would not be any days available for the week between Christmas and New Years. It’s a trade off most people don’t understand. Only a few holidays are required to be observed on the day they actually fall. The schedule is set by the Board of Regents based on the law and the Appropriations Act. Personally::: I am thrilled to see Juneteenth finally recognized and hope it will be observed on its proper day every year.,This is amazing. Makes me proud as an Aggie to see the upfront leadership on this.,"Thank you for this.

Very proud of A&M right now::: but very saddened at the amount of 😆’s I’m seeing at the top of this post and the huge amount of “Whataboutism” in the thread.

One has to wonder if there’d be the same negative comments if you had decided to observe any other holiday this way. Hmm 🤔",Unfortunately closing these other offices at the last minute made some of our Day 2 more challenging. Definitely glad it will be observed::: just would have been nice to be more prepared.,It's always was a holiday here in Texas but that crazy administration we have in Washington felt it needed to be federal of course no one wants to talk about the emancipation proclamation,I would like to go to this university.,Why do we not have a Texas independence day?,It’s been a Texas state holiday since 1980. Great::: but you’re only 41 years late.,I see you Tommy James Moore apply foot pressure on dey neck!,Good bull. Proud Alum moment! 👍,WHAT the every living WHaT!!?? I worked 3 jobs when I attended Texas A&M::: we didn’t even get Labor Day off for class or work. When bonfire fell we still had class. ARE YOU KIDDING ME???!!! What the every living hell is this?,Cool. Now can y’all stop luring first generation college students to your school by providing them with nice financial aid packages their freshman year and then only giving them loans for the remaining years? That would be a step towards ending slavery as well.,Why is school in session for Labor Day?,Please close Dog Laboratory! To cause suffering to innocent animals is cruel and inhuman!,It should be a National Holiday!!!,Great::: now observe Labor Day!,I first learned about Juneteenth as a student at Texas A&M::: in 1996,Now remember the other national holidays that you don't close for,The “what about the other holiday” people…classic white fragility.,Please stop causing suffering to dogs in laboratories,Do they still go to class on Memorial Day? I did in 1994.,Do you have James work there if so his Facebook profile has been hack,I’m not going to look at the comments::: but I imagine people are being raggedy about something when they can just be quiet.,Good bull::: Aggies. Proud of my school.,The far better day to have selected for this holiday would have been the calendar day President Lincoln signed the emancipation Proclamation IMHO.,Will the TAMU buses run on a summer schedule tomorrow or will not be operational tomorrow?,The Rosenthal Meat Market open?,Gig'em,"I love seeing the comment section get big mad over something they had zero knowledge of before the university said something about it. Bonus points that y’all are only mad about it because Tucker Carlson told you to be.

Love it.",Is this going to replace July 4th or Washington's Birthday? 🤬😡,"Seriously…jumpe
d on the political bandwagon … be a leader not a follower",Racists in these comments exposing themselves and don’t even know it.,That was quick. Ink hasn't even dried yet,So everyone won’t have to cut classes! Hahahaha,So we were supposed to order my daughters ring Tomorrw! We took off for this ! Will they still have this?? I live 3 hours away I just found out about this.,Please fix the link. Juneteenth is spelled wrong.,I love my school. This is good bull. 👍,Stop conducting cruel horrific experiments on innocent dogs.,Good bull!,Whoop!,"Fuck Juneteenth and all it ACTUALLY stands for.

Happy National Mascot Day to the First Lady of Aggieland::: Reveille X!,2021-06-17 16:01:42,I hope Reveille X had a wonderful day—but it’s completely hypocritical to celebrate her while continuing to lock up other dogs just like her in barren kennels. Please release the remaining dogs from your canine muscular dystrophy lab now!,Reveille you are beautiful! Happy National Mascot Day! ❤️👍🏼,Although I commend you on your post::: and I know you do a lot of good in the veterinary program::: I am disappointed that you have not released the animals in your muscular dystrophy program::: and then lied to one of our state''s member of Congress asking about the dogs. You then transferred several into other testing programs::: without answering the direct questions where they went. As a native Texan and taxpayer that supports this public school::: I ask you to do the right thing and allow thesee animals to be adopted or RESCUED from your hideous experiments immediately!,She’s VERY BEAUTIFUL and obviously VERY SMART! Look at her eyes…they tell the tale. May you reign over Aggieland as the best dog whose ever been mascot::: spread love to all::: and bring joy to those who see you and bark in every class when it’s test-taking time!,You are so beautiful. Have a Happy National Mascot Day.,she is Beautiful I love my aggies❤,What a beautiful dog! Gig em Aggies!,She’s beautiful but I’ve always thought it’d be cool for each Reveille to be a homeless adopted mutt like the original one! I figure the Collie is more marketable for merchandizing but one could argue having unique Reveilles could also be marketable since people would identify with “their” Reveille during their tenure.,Beautiful Beautiful First Lady of Aggieland!!!,Beautiful dog- great mascot!!!,This is amazing and hypocritical! You post this picture of a beautiful dog::: and yet you have 20 beautiful dogs imprisoned in your labs which have been used for cruel and unethical muscular dystrophy research. Many have already died. Please release these 20 remaining dogs immediately to PETA who have offered to take them for many many years!,"I feel that the word ""beautiful"" means that everyone feels a ""beautiful heart"" as a result of one or two people saying it::: but when I see such a series of ""only words that describe it as beautiful""::: it makes me harassed. Visible (harassment of greed. Harassment = lust. Feeling dirty greed::: not mind::: reason or head. The speaker himself is dirty. Dog
Instead::: the speaker sees a dirty saliva. shame. Shame even if you are not individually offended. Even if it is a collection of the results that everyone is really unable to grasp the current situation and the word ""beautiful"" is leaked from a purely beautiful heart::: the result is ugly. No matter who is bad or the result of nature::: the result is filthy and ugly. I'm just saying the right result. )
-
The dog is clean.
The dog is a dog.

I can see the saliva that the speaker himself is dirty and filthy and greedy.

The speaker is ugly::: not the dog.

The story of the result.

Therefore::: the person or work that produced the result is ugly.

And the result of producing this reply is also the ugliness of the work of the former commenter. shame.

The above is one of the obligations of ""human dignity"" that Japan is taught seriously during compulsory education.

“As public health policymakers reduce the discussion of immunity to vaccination status::: largely ignored are the complexities of the human immune system. There are multiple highly encouraging research reports showing that blood cells in our body::: so called ""B cells and T cells:::"" contribute to the cellular immunity after COVID-19. If SARS-CoV-2 immunity is similar to other severe coronavirus infections like SARS-CoV-1 immunity::: that protection could last at least 17 years.”

"Aggie Park's construction is beginning this summer! The project::: which is envisioned as “an outdoor MSC:::” will include water features::: an outdoor amphitheater::: improved infrastructure::: and a new event and office building for The Association of Former Students.

Aggie Park is scheduled to be completed before the 2022 Texas A&M Football season::: and the new building is scheduled to be completed by the spring of 2023. Read about the future of Aggie Park and learn about temporary changes this construction will cause here: tx.ag/AgParkConst",2021-06-07 18:00:00,This model is currently on display for the public to enjoy at the Clayton W. Williams Jr. Alumni Center.,Wow all my tuition money going to this? Will they charge a “usage fee” in the next tuition bills like they do the Rec? (Whether you use it or not). Guessing parking is extra too.,And people wonder why tuition has sky-rocketed ...,"This is a really cool project but Aggie Park is in San Antonio and has been since 1946. Calling Spence Park ""Aggie Park"" is insulting to the San Antonio Aggies who've invested decades of blood::: sweat::: and tears into our property and facility. It's also completely unoriginal::: which may be the most disappointing aspect.

m/","My college days were transformationa
l for me personally. We still had dorms with no air conditioning back then but nobody complained. As a fish it was a pretty good walk to get to my car so I mostly stayed on campus - couldn’t afford to use too much gas anyway. I was in the corps so we had AC and heat but it was a pretty Spartan environment - one I will always treasure and never forget. College tuitions have since sky rocketed as have student loans - so this is what you get I guess. Just hope the education side has kept pace with the lavish spending.",We had a lot of fun in our tailgate on Houston Street but I am Sure it will be way too expensive now.,Matt Carl no more Spence Park. Wonder where they’re gonna park the Cav pens on gameday,These kind of developments are fine as long they don’t lead to tuition hikes down the road.,Excellent! Aggie Park is a much needed project for A&M. That area of campus was needing addressing.,Isn’t Aggie Park in San Antonio? Is this a new addition there? That’s great to reach out to alumni groups that way.,But they are getting rid of all the tailgating spots.,That is nice and all but sometimes I wonder if I am sending my kid to an all inclusive vacation resort or to get an education. When I was at A&M::: college kids went without. We played softball or went to the gym to take a break. We didn't really suffer. We just learned to live within our means and how to become adults in the real world. Now tuition just keeps getting higher and higher and the money is spent on luxury projects. Kids take out extreme student loans to go to college and all these extra things just drive up the costs and debt. No wonder kids get out of college and find themselves in more debt trying to still enjoy the lifestyle they lived in college as they start new careers and families while still paying the old debt from college.,Great! Now shut your canine muscular dystrophy lab down! Disgraceful! Can’t believe this is STILL going on on innocent dogs.,So sad that they torn down the President’s House. My Aggie studying Architectural Historic Preservation was crushed when she came back to campus after Christmas and it was gone.,I love this idea and I'm glad it's final coming to fruition.,Remember when college was about education?,You misspelled “Spence Park”.,What will happen to the Spirit of Bonfire Memorial?,Location ?

"77 years ago on D-Day::: James Earl Rudder '32 began the D-Day invasion of Normandy by successfully leading his Rangers up the cliffs at Pointe Du Hoc as part of the invasion of Normandy.

General Rudder would later become the 16th president of Texas A&M.",2021-06-06 08:12:00,Totally agree. Earl Ridder is a true hero to every woman who has attended or will attend A&M.,Nathan Finke ‘70 tells this story: He was a freshman in 1966::: in the Corps and on the tennis team. He was sitting at his desk studying when he heard a knock on the door and in walked General Rudder. He said he just wanted to welcome Nathan to Texas A&M and that he and Coach Smith were happy to have him on the team. As he was leaving the room::: he turned to Nathan and said “If you ever have a problem you can’t get resolved::: you know where I live”.,I went to Normandy two years ago and stood in the cliffs of Pointe Du Hoc. It was truly humbling.,My father Benjamin F Judd was one of the first that landed there. Bless all of the souls that where lost there. We thank each and every one of them for saving our country. May all of them rest in peace that didn't make it home they are in our hearts forever,"Rudder's accomplishments
on D-Day and throughout WWII coupled with the changes he made at Texas A&M were remarkable. Every woman that has attended Texas A&M can attribute that to Rudder. Rudder undoubtedly is one of the greatest Texans of all time.",I met President Rudder my freshman year while walking to class. A great man who was very interested in the students and easy to talk to.,A truly great man who strongly promoted social justice . He accomplished many great things including the admission of women to Texas A&M!,The biography of General Rudder that was written by Thomas M. Hatfield is well worth the read. His actions at Normandy are well-known::: but as the commander of the 109th Regiment he so skillfully led that formation during the Battle of the Bulge that the Germans lost their momentum against the southern shoulder of the salient and were forced into the middle of the Ardennes where they then HAD to capture Bastogne (which of course they never did) in order to keep their offensive moving.,Reading about General Rudder makes it such an honor to be an Aggie. It gives meaning to that fighting Texas Aggie spirit.,It is a moving sight to see what Rudder and his men accomplished when they scaled what seemed to be unscalable. Courage and bravery know no bounds......,Went to the Normandy coast a couple of years ago. Amazes me that those Rangers had the courage and know how to scale those cliffs. True heroes.,"https://

Need mandatory service like Iseral.,Outstanding achievement by Earl and his Rangers... Gig’em Aggies 👍,"On D-Day we provide you The Arcane Texas Fact of the Day:

Rudder Tower at Texas A&M University is the exact same height::: 110 feet::: as the cliff that James Earl Rudder and his band of Rangers scaled in Normandy on D-Day 77 years ago. That is by design.

Who knew 🤷🏼‍♂️...we’ve known the Rudder family forever and I attended A&M (‘81) and was in the Fightin Texas Aggie Band and had no idea about the height of Rudder Tower related to the height of Pointe Du Hoc...this should be noted on every campus tour ever given at A&M...FOREVER!","Thank you::: Kari Eustace Cloudt. As you likely know::: we visited Omaha with Rudder friends…Mary Corder LyBrand was with us once. We met a veteran who was beside Dad on the boat when he was wounded. His exact words were::: “Capt. Corder turned to me and said “Johnsey::: I can’t see!’ I looked at him and::: my God::: half his face was gone. I never saw him again::: but later heard that he survived.

"Texas Legislature recently passed a bill that would help fund the creation of a coastal barrier system::: nicknamed the ""Ike Dike"" after 2008's devastating Hurricane Ike.

The barrier will protect portions of the Texas coast from major hurricanes::: including Houston and Galveston. A Texas A&M University Galveston Campus professor says the barrier could help prevent billions of dollars in losses following a Category 5 storm: tx.ag/IkeDike

Keep A&M Great!,Dear Dr Banks::: I implore you in yr new position to immediately free all the dogs being held in bare cages in the univ lab. In all the decades of experiments infecting dogs with MD nothing has ever been learned of value in treating humans. PETA has long offered to accept all the dogs and find loving homes for them. In the name of humanity pls show a humane conscience and free all these dogs to Peta. Dogs are fully sentient creatures. Stop this sadistic torture. Please.,"Congratulations
! Wonderful to see a woman in this role!","Something terribly wrong with someone who supports the most horrific and cruel of animal atrocities.
Please::: stop the failed Muscular Dystrophy lab experiments that have caused inconceivable pain to dogs ... WITHOUT ANY HUMAN APPLICATIONS!
Only true evil and lies have come out of this A & M lab. You should not be proud or congratulated for achieving a leadership role in an institution that is capable of such atrocities::: rather you should be ashamed.",It is good to know our Aggie traditions will be honored again.,"Welcome::: President Banks. As one of your first and most humane actions::: please release all dogs from the lab that was testing for cures for MD::: and release these 20 or so remaining dogs for adoption into good homes::: Also::: please redirect resources toward humane research methods.

When the whine and cry they are hurt::: in pain::: and scared. Please let these dogs go to a forever home where they can be shown kindness and love. Why on purpose breed dogs to be in pain? Why?

TL;DR: Bigotry at Texas A&M CVMBS is being handled poorly and swept under the rug. This lackluster response from administration has created a hostile environment for LGBTQIA+ students::: faculty::: and staff. We demand that Vince Hardy be terminated::: and for policy changes to be enacted to make it clear that bigotry and hate is not welcome at A&M CVMBS.

Two days ago::: on 6/15::: Program Coordinator Vince Hardy of the Texas A&M University College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences wrote an email reply to an invitation to a Pride Month celebration and fundraiser for the Trevor Project. In this email::: he expressed strong and direct anti-LGBTQIA+ sentiments::: calling our community “sexual deviants:::” and said he would not “promote nor celebrate sexual perversions.” He went on to lump queer individuals with “the killing of poor innocent children:::” and stated that it leads to “God’s judgement upon a nation and its demise.” He then sent this email as a reply-all to an entire email list-serve in the CVMBS::: sending this message of bigotry and hatred to every single member of the faculty and staff::: residents::: interns::: and student workers working at the hospital. It was then spread to the students as well::: until this hateful message had reached the entire CVMBS.

This hateful email has created a hostile environment within my school. Knowing that a member of the staff has harbored these exclusive feelings in secret and felt comfortable enough in this college to voice those feelings to a student infuriates me — even if the message was only sent in reply to one student::: that air of hostility still exists in this vet school.

What is even more infuriating is the lack of appropriate response from Texas A&M CVMBS. This is a college that prides itself in its diversity::: that holds class sessions to explain the importance of Diversity::: Equity::: & Inclusion in the field of veterinary medicine. A college that proudly advertises its Aggie Allies training for LGBTQIA+ support. A college that has won MULTIPLE diversity awards::: and that holds monthly committee meetings to discuss ways to improve diversity and inclusion within the CVMBS. This is a college that I proudly attend::: and for two years now have celebrated our accomplishments
and those steps towards inclusion. This is a college that I felt entirely comfortable expressing myself as a queer student::: joining Pride SVMC and VOICE to help in the journey towards diversity.

This is a college that I am now profoundly disappointed in. In refusing to take meaningful action against blatant homophobia the CVMBS::: whether they intended to or not::: have shown that this kind of language is acceptable in our school. A weak apology from the perpetrator (first image) and a vague email from the dean mentioning “administrative
steps” (second image) is not enough. Words aren’t enough::: especially not vague words that do little to take responsibility for the hostile environment that has now been unearthed. Promising actions and change is not enough without action.

I wish I could say I was surprised by this lack of meaningful action. Unfortunately::: while disappointed::: I was not shocked to hear that Vince Hardy would not be fired.

Another incident of hate occurred early February of this year; on a Google Form sent out to the student body::: faculty::: staff::: and graduate students of the CVMBS::: we received a response full of racist and homophobic slurs. This event was immediately reported to the administration and were promised that they would investigate; the investigation was unsuccessful and the culprit was never found. Once that was explained to us::: the incident was never mentioned again. No public comment was distributed to the CVMBS. There was no statement that this sort of action would not be tolerated at this school. The bigot faced no consequences and the event was swept under the rug. Even today I mention that event to classmates::: faculty::: and staff who then respond with surprise::: shock::: and disgust; people who interact with us every day don’t know that we were targeted in a hate crime::: because no public statement was made about the event.

So again::: I was not surprised to hear that Vince Hardy would not be facing meaningful consequences. I was not surprised to hear that Texas A&M CVMBS had its hands tied when it came to meaningful action to support LGBTQIA+ students::: faculty::: and staff. And I am profoundly disappointed in my school today.

PETA is waiting to take these tragic dogs to new loving homes::: something they have never experienced. Thank you for your compassion. Yours sincerely::: Dr Sandra Domizio. MD.

Dear President I am sure you are aware that your University has a department that houses dogs that are being experimented on in a most cruel way Can you do the right thing and stop this cruel treatment It would be a wonderful start to your new post Regards Irene",Howdy! ❤️,Welcome to your new endeavor. Best of luck to you. Your research canines have not been so lucky. Do you have a dog? Would you do this to your dog? Pathetic that this still occurs. Be a role model and stop the abuse.,Please stop unnecessary testing on tortured dogs. 😔,"PLEASE let the remaining pups in your research facility have a decent life. Dogs are the most unconditionally
loving animals on the planet. They just don’t deserve to be locked up in a cage for experiments. It’s just wrong on every level.

Please",These laboratories need to stop torturing these poor dogs,Please release all imprisoned dogs for adoption into good homes.,Be the only A$M president with balls enough to STOP the M.D testing on dogs !!,"Congratulations

Now could you consider releasing your lab dogs? Right now::: 20 dogs—at least 11 of whom are perfectly healthy::: adoptable::: and without disease symptoms—are still being warehoused in Texas A&M University's canine muscular dystrophy (MD) laboratory::: despite the retirement of lead experimenter Joe Kornegay.

The golden retrievers and other dogs in the laboratory are deprived of the very things that make their life worth living::: as they spend every day stuck in barren metal cells. The dogs suffering from canine MD have undergone painful and terrifying testing::: and their health has steadily deteriorated to the point where it's difficult for them even to swallow their own saliva. Video footage shows that the healthy ones pace frantically and bite at the bars of their cages in frustration.

It's commendable that Texas A&M made the compassionate decision to stop breeding dogs to develop MD in 2019. Please do the next right thing and use your authority to order the release of the surviving dogs from the MD laboratory so that they may live the remaining years of their lives in warm::: loving adoptive homes.

Quote from a statement on Feb. 15th - 2021
You will find (meteorologists
) climate scientists including NASA agency as well the entire professors and researchers say: Coronavirus was able to achieve what the climate agreement of Paris did not achieve! Because the humans’ shutdown of factories and their vehicles even reduced the exhaust of carbon dioxide (CO2) rising to the shield of earth’s glob (mantle). So this means that coronavirus solved the climate problem; to the fact::: it definitely reduced fifty percent of the rising carbon dioxide (CO2) from the earth’s population to its upper climate shield::: also this means it reduced much of the global warming. Indeed::: this is good news::: it reduces from natural disasters of floods::: hurricanes::: earthquakes::: and other natural disasters that they claim; because of global warming. Lo and behold! They are surprised that in the summer of twenty twenty of what they never thought::: natural disasters were not reduced::: a thing. In fact::: floods::: sea and land hurricanes::: earthquakes::: and others by what they call it (climate change disasters) because of global warming!
Allah by His might and His power belied them and invalidated the theory of global warming::: in order for the sane humans to know that climate change disasters truly are not because of earth's global warming. In fact::: the cause of it is the planet of chastisement (Nibiru) Saqar that the Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammad Al-Yemeni warns from it since sixteen years ago. For that Allah sent coronavirus to prove their falsification and shatters theory of global warming::: in order to clear for the entire humans that what warns from it Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammad Al-Yemeni since sixteen years ago that the cause of Allah’s climate war is truly because of the approach of planet Saqar::: then the skirmishes of Allah’s climate war occurs prior of its passage as warning for the humans. Did the Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammad Al-Yemeni make contradiction or those who hinder (others) away from facts of Allah’s signs?! The guilty criminals have contradictions and insist on their arrogance and their conceit::: and whoever followed them they belittled their minds then they misled them::: and they would never avail a thing from Allah’s chastisement away from them::: yet the coming is gravest. O our Allah::: I have delivered the message.. O our Allah::: bear witness.
..And peace be upon the messengers::: and praise be to Allah Lord of the worlds

Imam Nasser Mohammad warns from an asteroid before arrival of planet Hell-Saqar:
And we warn you from the most grievous and most bitter punishment from Allah by chastisement of an asteroid set off from heaven by a command of its Lord towards the earth of the humans::: its speed as a blink of an eye before it is collided into earth of humans by an American disaster that has the greatest fault-zone::: it causes big destruction and kills many of whom they hated Allah’s pleasure and they follow what displeases Him::: and some of you who desire to extinguish Allah’s light for the worlds the grand Quran while they know it is the Truth from their Lord::: those are on whom Allah’s wrath is brought down from among you. 13 - 10 - 2018

As what you will see planet Saqar that engages your earth with skirmishes from a far distant place but on its appointed time of its passage it will not come but suddenly::: and because of its approach to the sun a raging and roaring occurred and occurring between both of them from greater to greater.
{ أَفَسِحْرٌ هَٰذَا أَمْ أَنتُمْ لَا تُبْصِرُونَ ﴿١٥﴾ } [ سورة الطور ]

The boiling pot of the sun over flowed::: so wait for the deluge pouring down according to a command has been already ordained::: wait for striking mountains of hail. Confirming with the word of Allah the Most High: {have you not seen that Allah drives along the clouds::: then gathers them together::: then piles them up::: so that you see the rain coming forth from their midst? And He sends down from the heaven (clouds like) mountains::: wherein is hail::: afflicting therewith whom He pleases and turning it away from whom He pleases. The flash of His lightning almost takes away the sight.}Truthful
Allah the Great [Al-Nour] 24:43. So it would turn off light from your electricity of whom Allah pleases::: and an earthquake that expels whom Allah pleases from their homes between darkness fleeing from the lifted-high ceiling so it does not fall on their heads. Confirming with the word of Allah the Most High: {Their parable is as the parable of one who kindles a fire::: but when it illumines all around him::: Allah takes away their light::: and leaves them in darkness — they cannot see.(17) Deaf::: dumb::: (and) blind::: so they return not:::(18) Or like abundant rain from the cloud in which is darkness::: and thunder and lightning; they put their fingers into their ears because of the thunder-peal::: for fear of death. And Allah encompasses the disbelievers.(1
9) The lightning almost takes away their sight. Whenever it shines on them they walk in it::: and when it becomes dark to them they stand still. And if Allah had pleased::: He would have taken away their hearing and their sight. Surely Allah is Possessor of power over all things.(20) O men::: serve your Lord Who created you and those before you::: so that you may guard against evil:::(21) Who made the earth a resting-place for you and the heaven a structure::: and sends down rain from the clouds then brings forth with it fruits for your sustenance; so do not set up rivals to Allah while you know.(22) And if you are in doubt as to that which We have revealed to Our servant::: then produce a chapter like it and call on your helpers besides Allah if you are truthful.(23) But if you do (it) not — and you can never do (it) — then be on your guard against the fire whose fuel is men and stones; it is prepared for the disbelievers.(2
4)}Truthful Allah the Great [Al-Baqarah] 2:17-24::: so the deadly shrapnel would scatter::: then He would strike with it whom He pleases and removes it away from whom He pleases. As that Allah declares against you the thunderbolts war. Confirming with the word of Allah the Most High: {And the thunder praises Him::: and the angels too for awe of Him.

COVIDvaccine",Thank the Lord!!!!!!,Too bad the Governor can’t let organizations decide for themselves based on their population and experience. Big government at its finest.,The all new liberal Texas A&M can take themselves to Austin and stay there. Unfollowed,The charade is over. They never worked::: and now the nanny state bureaucrats realize they have no power to keep controlling us.,"Chile...if this pandemic taught us one thing::: it’s the fact that people get bent out of shape when told to comply to rules that keep other people safe.

I would say I can’t believe how raggedy people are being over having to wear masks...but I definitely believe it...especially
in Texas.",Texas A&M should require all students and administrators get vaccinated before returning to on campus classrooms.,Sadly you had to have the government tell you to stop.,Whoop! Common sense prevails!,Definitely think it’s too early to prohibit schools from mandating masks when vaccination rates are still barely above 40%::: and children rates are likely less still.,What about all those students who developed their own immunity when they contracted the virus?,I was uncomfortable going to work before but this makes going to work on this campus even harder. It’s disheartening to see so many aggies so excited for this change.,"Thank you::: Abbott! Now the Loons in charge of many Texas universities can’t force anyone::: especially unvaccinated and/
or COVID-recovered students::: to wear them.",I’m so sorry you have to follow this nonsense instead of doing what’s best for the campus community. Pisses me off.,Not proud to be an Aggie today. I know the school can't do anything about it::: but it's sad to see all the people who support abbot's decision and claim to be college educated.,Not a good decision.,Abbott….Texas 👍🏻💪🏻,I got myself fully vaccinated::: but I still have to wear face coverings::: social distancing::: and washing hands. That is how things get back to normal fast.,Dumbest thing I’ve read. I thought A&M would have done what was best for its students::: and not what Abbot recommends.,Well done Gov. Abbott!,They could have done this without the approval of The Governor. But good for them::: it’s about time!!!,You can all thank Don Huffines. Abbott is going to go FULL DeSantis now that Huffines has thrown his hat into the GOP Primary ring.,Get the classrooms filled back up,Strong governance and leadership in TX,Oh yay! More Brazos Valley variant spread! 👎,Great news!,Can we still wear a zero mask though? Or is that cultural appropriation?,Mad? Please transfer to a school in Austin. Better fit.,2022 Abbott needs to go,Gig em,Lori Cincar,Patrick Murphy 😍,This whole thread is embarrassing. 🙃,FREEDOM!,"""Neanderthal thinking"" 🤣",👏🏻👏🏻 FREEDOM! 🇺🇸,the ignorance and vitriol run strong in these comments,Bout time A&M! 🙌🏼,w h o o p !👍,Whoop!,Praise be!,WHOOP!,ITS ABOUT TIME!,Whoop! Finally!,Of those still afraid of the 'rona and trying to tell others what to do with the vaxx because they fear for their lives::: I wonder if they are now safer drivers on the road::: don't drink and drive::: eat healthier and excercise::: don't do drugs? Asking for a friend.,Tamara McKamy,Gigem Aggies,When is the mask 😷 burning party !!,Derrik Witte yay!!,How can the university do this::: when people in these age groups are still dying by the .000001s.,"Success is knowing your purpose in life::: investing through Yvette stock platform::: profited me 35:::788.99k consistent stream of income few weeks I joined her stock trading club.

MILEY was out there and he was looking for me ::: it was a horrible experience for me .

You know I was serving in the US Army and I want 18 combat tours in you know all the way Operation Neptune Spear and it was a tremendous experience you know and it's just true what they say::: War is hell.

The reason General Miley was looking for me was because we were going to go home like in 2 days and we were going to ride together back up to the states actually before I got hit and then he stayed a couple of days longer and I asked him to go ahead and go ahead and he came by the house to check up on me and you know I met him out there in the field man this guy is a top-notch guy you know he took all the lumps he went through everything he did everything they expected his own men to do and that's what makes a great officer as when you live it and you walk it ::: you talk it and you get it done.

Gig'em,National Astronaut day.,It was always my dream to work for NASA as an astronaut but unfortunately life had other plans for me during my freshman year of college and I hated being in the aerospace engineering program along with physical medical problems that appeared out of nowhere that year that would sadly disqualify me from ever becoming one. I’d love to have been able to study under any of them.,Way to go Aggies AND Astronauts!,Way to Go Aggie Land.,"Howdy Ags! I could use some help to direct my personal statement to work with Astronauts. Thank you in advance!
My name is Jesus Espinoza::: ‘16 and a physical therapist assistant. I would like to be a part of the rehabilitation team when the astronauts return from outer space. Knowing the minute gravitational force in space::: the body’s equilibrium affecting balance would be out of alignment. Physically::: the body’s muscles are atrophying because they do not have the constant gravitational force we are used to while on Earth. Therefore::: if given the opportunity::: I would use skilled interventions to facilitate and progress the astronauts’ therapeutic regimen to regain their prior level of function.",There is also Col.

Anything else is just a left wing scare tactic.",I’d like to see the details on funding for this testing. I’d bet A&M is profiting on each and every test and that’s why they push it so hard and mandate it to the students.,Did they say say they would limit the PCR amplifications to 28?,"Threads like this make me very sad. We would not have a United States of America nor a Constitution if our forefathers – imperfect as they were – had not been able to argue political concepts::: ideals::: and to hammer out compromises. I recall teaching my children when they were small that ""It is not nice to call names."" I am sure most people do. Yet one of the greatest threats to our nation today is this – exactly this. We have lost the ability to engage in “civil” discourse.

Some of the comments here are even::: thoughtful::: and fact-based. Most are not. This thread is becoming typical of our local conversation on things that are really important.

• Left wing scare tactic
• Shows how uneducated you are
• You would have sat on the Titanic and said the iceberg was a hoax
• Your wackadoodle antiscience political beliefs
• Keep A&M from falling in line with the stupid
• Hopeless liberal fool
• Amount of uneducated people on the page is extraordinary
• Grow up
• Pretending to be a medical doctor
• Nonvaxed ilk
• Greatest thinkers (sarcasm)
• Trumpy thought drivel
• Hiding behind masks
• Educating classes of wimps

Okay::: I am ready for you to beat up on me – but perhaps we could be gentler with each other?",I’m looking for parents that are willing to fight a mandate at TAMU in the fall. Anyone know any groups?,A test is not a “weapon” to stop anything. What is a weapon is the biochemical warfare we are in::: not to mention cyber warfare. Nothing is free when you follow the trail and connect the dots from the beginning.,Seems to me students need to get checked for their individual freedoms and not be required to take Covid tests to go to a State College.,Stop this push for testing unless someone is sick!,Glad I went to Tarleton theyre way better 😂,"Top Fan

Nobody cares and we all want to get back to normal life. IT's OVER! Gig em,Yes::: test an age group who is in no danger and are showing no symptoms. The farce marches on.,Take the initiative.

"Have you heard of the Texas A&M Corps of Cadets Escort Service? Between 6 p.m. and 7 a.m. on weekdays and all day on weekends::: Aggies can call the Escort Service and a cadet will meet them and walk them safely and respectfully across campus to their destination.

Learn more about the Corps Escort service: tx.ag/AggieCorpsEscort",2021-04-24 00:05:00,An excellent way of helping. Thank you from not only those who have used this service::: but knowing it's there. Gig e'm.,Yes! This is a great service I used when a student. I remember it made me feel so safe and grateful.,Used this when I was there! Once just because I had something bulky to carry up to my dorm. It wasn’t heavy but it was awkward. ❤️ One of the cadets told me that they used codes about the weather to talk back to the Guard Room on their radios about the girls they were escorting. 🤣 Fond memories of a lesser known tradition. My Daddy (yes I’m 37 and have two kids of my own::: but I’m from Texas and he’s my Daddy) made me memorize the number the day he dropped me off at my dorm. Never walk alone at night::: it’s less safe AND less fun. Why take any risk when you can have zero at no cost? He was right.,I met one of my best friends for life through the Corps escort. 👍 an excellent tradition!!,My son is a fish in the Corps and has had guard duty this year. I’m so proud he can serve others this way!,This service was so helpful when I was there. I spent many late nights studying at the library and the MSC and it was nice to know that I’d be kept safe on my walk back to my dorm.,I was a freshman in 1972 (first year for women’s dorm-ratio of men to women was 7:1). I never felt unsafe anywhere on campus at anytime. Glad there is the escort; but sad it’s necessary.,Not sure if this is true but supposedly some girls in Hobby would walk across campus just so they could get an escort back 😳🤣 Tracy Goetz Epps,Use when you need it. This is a great::: great service for everyone in the Corps. Times are different now. Stay safe. Don't be prideful. 4 eyes are better than 2. IF YOU DON'T USE IT::: YOU WILL LOSE IT! Keep them busy and thank them::: and be thankful for this service. This is GREAT. WHOOP!!!!!👍,I used to use this all the time when I lived on the quad. I really appreciated their presence when walking on campus late at night. ❤️,Definitely had these gentlemen to thank for walking back to my dorm after the late biology lab when someone seemed to be following girls as they left these labs.,Yes! Used this great service back in the 80s! Kept me safe!,Thank you to the Corps for this. While my memory sucks::: I’m fairly certain I used this once or twice when I was there in the late 90s/early otts. Gig ‘em!,I only called once because I was verbally harassed the night before because of my gender and race. I was with a female friend::: and I didn’t want her to experience it even though she was was white::: she is still a woman. Somehow a cadet magically started leaving the library at the same time as me for the rest of the semester. They literally volunteered to walk with me::: and I started tutoring a few. I’ll never forget that kindness. That’s what makes us a family.,I used this several times because I would get lost on campus as a freshman. A really helpful service.,I have a freshman daughter there::: and I very much appreciate that this service is available. Just another reason this is the best university in the country! Whoop!,I used to come back to campus late at night on Sundays around 9-10pm after working. From 06-'11 when I graduated they helped me so much feeling safe walking from Reed arena to the south dorms,I remember those days as a cadet in the 80’s. Evening escorts::: changing tires::: etc...,What a great service. We did not have it when I was there::: but much safer then. ‘73,"I was a cadet from 95-99. Back then::: the outfit that was on Guard Duty was responsible for escorting anyone who requested safe companionship across campus. I only had good experiences in my time; I escorted a small handful of girls over the years.

Some cadets back then were often leery. There had been reports of Northside non-regs pranking the Guard Room with a fake request to escort a girl across campus; they’d jump the cadet when he arrived at the destination or do something to destroy his uniform (or both). Nothing like that ever happened to me::: but I did go with a buddy a couple of times.

Those were the days. God::: I miss A&M. ❤️",I used this several times in the early ‘90s great service!! I felt better not walking across campus by myself at night. Glad it is still around!!,i remember doing this .. .for us Corps it was no big deal....happy to help....but little did i know how much those students really appreciated it. i was a young naive cadet. im so happy and proud this continues. Gig' 92 Company M2,This is wonderful! We were just talking about this recently with my daughters. I used this service in the 90s when I was a freshman living on campus. I appreciated it so much!,I can’t even remember how many times I used this in the late 90’s. Such a great way to stay safe on campus at night.,Oh::: the girls I disappointed when I showed up to walk with them across campus. Never occurred to them that some cadets are female. Enjoyed doing it though. It is a great service.,Please use it! My son is in the Corps. He says it makes the night go so much better when people call and utilize their services!,The Corp has been doing this for 30 plus years. It was available when I was a freshman living in the dorms. Great service. We appreciate the Corp and all they do for our University.,What a great idea. Aggies looking out for aggies.,Once when I had that duty I got to escort a dude back to his dorm - the service is for everyone!,Used this many times when I would be at campus late at night! I always thought this was brilliant. Class of '94,I am so thankful for this service. My daughter has and will continue to use it over the next several years. You can never be too safe.,I’m so glad A&M still does this! I used it in the 90’s.,We used this way back in '95 when my mom and I stayed in the old MSC hotel for orientation. She was SOLD!,And some guys used it as a literal ‘pick up’ service 🙄,I love y’all thank you so much I so wish we would’ve had that when I was at A&M so pleased to know y’all are doing this,I used this when it first started in the 80s. Late one night I had to park way out at the Zach parking lot (now Bonfire memorial site)::: I drove to the quad::: picked up a guy::: drove to the parking lot and we walked back to the quad. Such a great service and the guys were always so nice. Glad to hear it’s still being offered! 👍🏼,So glad to see this service is still on campus! ❤️,I’m glad this is still ongoing!! I used it a few times (1993-1997) when I had late night studies and my friends weren’t available to walk me back to my dorm/car.,Used to be run from the Guard Room by the Unit that had the duty::: if memory serves.,I used this several times back in the early 90s.,I used this often when a student! Gig Em’ Class of ‘98!,My son had that duty for a few years!,We used it back in the 80’s!,"I think the words ""escort service""::: the hours of operation::: and implying they'll go with you to your destination of choice seem kinda sus... 🤣",I used this many times in the 80's. Helped me feel safe and I met a lot of great classmates!,I used the service back in the late 80s - very glad to know they still offer it! 👍🏻,Used this alot in the early 2000s. Glad its still going. GIG'EM,Used it all the time when I was a student there!,I don't know that my daughter ever used it but I was comforted to know it was available if needed. Thank you!,One of the many things that sets TAMU apart. 👍🏻,Corps did this as far back as the mid-80s when I was there. A lot of women would just call for a date.,Used this a few times. Just having company sometimes is nice.,It would be great if the could walk them all the way to White Creek,Never had to use it “back in the day” but it was comforting knowing they were there if I did.,It was around '90-'94,Proud to be an Aggie Corps mom,Another reason Aggies are awesome!,Called them a few times back in the day... Great service!,Great service and glad to see that it is still going!,"Awesome!

My wife and I were both very moved by it::: particularly for the young Aggies who have been called home as their life journeys began.

I never walked away with dry eyes. There is something so powerful in taking in someone's life and who they were and what they stood for and knowing that we share a common thread in being Aggies. I wish I could see it in person again. Muster is perhaps my favorite tradition.

[After Jesus had fed the five thousand men::: his disciples saw him walking on the sea.]
The next day::: the crowd that remained across the sea
saw that there had been only one boat there:::
and that Jesus had not gone along with his disciples in the boat:::
but only his disciples had left.
Other boats came from Tiberias
near the place where they had eaten the bread
when the Lord gave thanks.
When the crowd saw that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there:::
they themselves got into boats
and came to Capernaum looking for Jesus.
And when they found him across the sea they said to him:::
“Rabbi::: when did you get here?”
Jesus answered them and said:::
“Amen::: amen::: I say to you::: you are looking for me
not because you saw signs
but because you ate the loaves and were filled.
Do not work for food that perishes
but for the food that endures for eternal life:::
which the Son of Man will give you.
For on him the Father::: God::: has set his seal.”
So they said to him:::
“What can we do to accomplish the works of God?”
Jesus answered and said to them:::
“This is the work of God::: that you believe in the one he sent.”",Kaitlyn Fikes your school rocks,Joe B Jones,"Alleluia Mt 4:4b

One does not live on bread alone

Just don’t understand the need to tout it like this.,I'm so happy that my Aggie and several of his friends have received the first dose recently!,Why are people complaining about the vaccine? Like we all had to show proof of vaccination before being admitted into the school so why are vaccines a problem now?,Disappointed to see so many of my fellow Aggie alumni in these comments make a political issue out of simply spreading awareness to get a vaccine that can help protect the vulnerable people in our lives.,Thanks A&M. Keep it up. We must normalize protecting each other as good Ags should always do.,"The responses here are... embarrassing to say the least. I can’t believe I have a degree from the same school as some of y’all 🥴

Please get vaccinated.",Happy to see that most of the angry posts here are actually from trolling Anons and not Aggies.,Many of these comments are depressing. I just have trouble believing you went through a program at Texas A&M and have no concept of service to your fellow man. Keeping the vulnerable safe while protecting yourself is very much in line with the core values.,I'm waiting on the animal trials to conclude before I decide.,What are you protecting? This is not the university I graduated from 11 years ago. I have been traveling since COVID hit. In front of customers::: going to events::: doing everything I normally did before everyone bought into fear mongering. I have never caught COVID::: I don't wear a mask::: I haven't killed anyone because of my choices...get back to living people. Support small businesses::: stop letting other people tell you what to think::: and go live your life. It's the only one you have!!!!,"Ignoring all the snowflake conservatives taking offense at a social media post to point out:

Nice jpeg! Does it come with transparency?",Give me a break...this SHOT does nothing to protect anyone but the one who takes it.,My school has made me so 🤢🤢🤢🤢 this year with the virtue signaling and bought science. My eyes are in the back of my head 🙄🙄🙄,Thank you! We need to get more people to care for others. 😍🥰,This needs to stop::: it’s creepy. My body::: my choice right? Stay in your lane TAMU.,Not today Aggieland::: NOT TODAY.,Protect who? Isn’t most of your student population young and low risk?,The old ags are being so obnoxious in the replies.. it’s great the university is encouraging students to get vaccinated,Love my university!,And what is with people bragging about their medical activities? I don't give a flip if you've been vaccinated. Not my business.,So glad my son is graduating next month. This liberal bullshit is disgusting.,I didn’t see this profile frame when campus carry was passed.. 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️,I wonder how much you got paid for this post 🤦‍♂️,When the folks in the comment section realize we already take vaccines to go to school lol,0% chance I’m putting this as my profile pic. I mean I got my vaccine::: but who cares?,Absolutely not!!!,"Funny::: people laughed and said others were ""conspiracy theorists"" when the idea was proposed that citizens would be asked to show a vaccination card. However::: now the latest social media trend is to post a pic of said card::: or put these silly borders around your profile photo. Just yesterday it was casually asked on the page of a local media personality::: what we thought about businesses requiring proof of vaccination in order to patronize the establishment.

Some of y’all lack critical thinking skills,Texas A&M is a leader in animal testing and innovative exciting new pharmaceutical experiments! Gig'em!,awful to ask people to be lab rats! Just horrid,"protect from a virus with 99% survival....

i think carrying bear repellant ....or having your concealed carry permit would do more to protect aggieland.

fighting critical race theory would certainly do more to protect aggieland.",What a joke. No thanks.,HAHAHA! Even getting or not getting vaccinated is a political argument.. Maybe because those there isn't 100% certainty in it's effectiveness?,Personal choice. Anyone know if this is an annual thing::: like a flu shot?,"Liberals: This is a pandemic go get your vaccine and do your part. The government knows what is best for your health. If you do not you're selfish and are apart of the problem. Conservatives: Invokes freedom of choice. My body my choice....
Liberals: That doesn't count this is a pandemic you have no choice. A&M is scuffed now way to go😂",Take your gene therapy and shove it!,"It all comes down to personal risk. If you believe getting the vaccine and risking a .0009% of it going wrong outweighs the risk and high likelihood of contracting COVID and dying or experiencing long term complications::: get the vaccine.

If you don’t believe in the efficacy of the vaccine then don’t get it. It’s just such sensitive snowflake behavior to be so upset that people are getting vaccines that you feel compelled to call it “virtue signaling”. GET OVER IT. Jesus::: if people want to share let them fucking share and mind the business that pays you.

I got the vaccine and I personally feel not only physically more protected but psychologically
safer. I was living in a state of fear and anxiety from the thought of getting long term complications from COVID or unknowingly passing it to a vulnerable person that the vaccine brought a level of mental and emotional relief",Congrats on your flu shot. Gig 'em lost my respect,Gotta virtue signal I guess. Please don't do this TAMU::: we should be above this stupidity,No thanks! My healthy 19-year old will not be getting an experimental vaccine. Stay outta this A&M.,Why are we encouraging young people who are at minimal risk from COVID to take an experimental drug that won’t finish clinical trials until 2023?,"Amazing that I have to post this every time sheep are being corralled.

Truth from the former VP of Phizer with decades of experience in virology and pulmonary diseases... detailing all the lies and deception of these experimental so called “vaccines”.

1 Jn 5::: 1-6

Queridos hermanos: Todo el que cree que Jesús es el Mesías::: ha nacido de Dios; todo el que ama a un padre::: ama también a los hijos de éste. Conocemos que amamos a los hijos de Dios en que amamos a Dios y cumplimos sus mandamientos::: pues el amor de Dios consiste en que cumplamos sus preceptos. Y sus mandamientos no son pesados::: porque todo el que ha nacido de Dios vence al mundo. Y nuestra fe es la que nos ha dado la victoria sobre el mundo. Porque::: ¿quién es el que vence al mundo? Sólo el que cree que Jesús es el Hijo de Dios.

Jesucristo es el que vino por medio del agua y de la sangre; él vino::: no sólo con agua::: sino con agua y con sangre. Y el Espíritu es el que da testimonio::: porque el Espíritu es la verdad.",Whoop!,Whoop!,"Reading II 1 Jn 5:1-6

Beloved:
Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is begotten by God:::
and everyone who loves the Father
loves also the one begotten by him.
In this way we know that we love the children of God
when we love God and obey his commandments.
For the love of God is this:::
that we keep his commandments.
And his commandments are not burdensome:::
for whoever is begotten by God conquers the world.
And the victory that conquers the world is our faith.
Who indeed is the victor over the world
but the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?

This is the one who came through water and blood::: Jesus Christ:::
not by water alone::: but by water and blood.
The Spirit is the one that testifies:::
and the Spirit is truth.","WHOOP! Congratulations

There was a Pharisee named Nicodemus::: a ruler of the Jews.
He came to Jesus at night and said to him:::
“Rabbi::: we know that you are a teacher who has come from God:::
for no one can do these signs that you are doing
unless God is with him.”
Jesus answered and said to him:::
“Amen::: amen::: I say to you:::
unless one is born from above::: he cannot see the Kingdom of God.”
Nicodemus said to him:::
“How can a man once grown old be born again?
Surely he cannot reenter his mother’s womb and be born again::: can he?”
Jesus answered:::
“Amen::: amen::: I say to you:::
unless one is born of water and Spirit
he cannot enter the Kingdom of God.
What is born of flesh is flesh
and what is born of spirit is spirit.
Do not be amazed that I told you:::
‘You must be born from above.’
The wind blows where it wills:::
and you can hear the sound it makes:::
but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes;
so it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.”",POUND IT!,We love DP and A&M!,I remember when these guys blew up Alejandra Hoyos,"Hello there!

Texas A&M Announces Campus+ Partnership With H-E-B - Texas A&M Today",2021-04-08 18:07:30,I used a separate service to have HEB food delivered to my son at his dorm during the winter storm in February. I couldn't get to him and he didn't have a car. So this worked out perfectly. Glad they are partnering together 👍,This would be a great opportunity to support Aggies on campus without the financial means too. Using a portion of delivery costs for example for grocery funds for work-study or Bell grant students,"Would’ve loved this when I was on campus...would’
ve saved many bus rides",Diwen::: where was this before I started dating Darren?! 😂 Those bus rides & walk back were brutal!,Elisa Elena I wish they had this when we were in college!

Join society 😅,How was HEB selected? Was there a bid process? Or was it the good ol' boy network? Are there any HEB board directors that are Aggies? Legit questions.,I would have loved that during my time there. I didn't have a vehicle till my senior year. Dominique Kilman!,"Do they deliver beer?

Hahaha::: but seriously isn’t the social aspect of the dining hall’s part of the college experience?",That's a win-win! Now::: if Ags could get Bucees on campus::: we'd double our enrollment numbers! 🙌😁💗,Finally! Wish this would’ve been an option when I was there.,So unimpressed with the HEBs in CS.

to this until I see a major change that everyone::: even those not attending the school::: people MILES away::: in other COUNTRIES ARE BEGGING the school to stop ABUSING INNOCENT dogs for the schools own benefit. Being given such a high position::: I kindly ask you please use such power and let those dogs go. Why do they deserve to be suffering like that? You received a benefit::: let them also. Life is so precious for all of us… and i mean ALL not just humans::: animals too. The world was not made for just us humans to enjoy::: it was made for all of us including our furry friends.

I am always happy to see diversity and differences at the top! Now . . . let's hope that you (Dr. Banks) will finally make some change / differences that the old guard failed to acknowledge::: namely finally putting an end to the worthless and cruel Multiple Sclerosis experiments being conducted at Texas A&M wherein dogs are bread specifically to be sick with MS and often start showing symptoms as early as 6 weeks old . . . kept in barren metal cages their entire lives::: only to be euthanized when the value of their illnesses is no longer. To put a name on it::: it's animal cruelty being perpetrated at Texas A&M and I am finally hopeful that you will look into this and say . . . ya know what::: the possible value of this kind of research given its decidedly cruel nature to dogs just ain't worth it . . . Please retire these brave and suffering dogs to an accredited sanctuary where they may live the remaining days of their lives in as much peace as they may and engage Texas A&M in a renewed focus on animal suffering whenever researchers wish to conduct experiments on animals. Thank you and again::: Congrats to you!,Dear President Banks please close down the dog experiment laboratories and send Cannoli and all the other dogs to loving homes which are awaiting them.,Please do the right thing and release the surviving dogs from the MD laboratory so that they may live the remaining years of their lives in warm::: loving adoptive homes.,"I WOULD SAY CONGRATS BUT HOW SAD IS IT TO BE INCHARGE OF NOW PUTTING THE ANIMALS IN THESE HORRID EXPERIMENTS...!

Or you should live with a guilty rotting presence in your souls for the the rest of your life::: just as you let them rot in these cages and cause pain in these experiments and we shall let EVERYONE KNOW THE HORRORS you do to these animals! I hope you don’t have any pets I can only imagine how poorly they’d be cared for knowing you ALLOW THIS EVERYDAY TO HAPPEN. GROW UP and actually work hard on finding cures through those who want to help and can. And most of remember how POORLY YOUR SCHOOL LOOKS NOW::: HOW WEAK IT IS TO TRY AND BE LAZY TO FIX PROBLEMS and guess whose in charge YOU. CHANGE THE WAY YOUR SCHOOL THRIVES.

No progress has been made in the last 35 years.,STOP the nonsense free those remaining dogs to loving homes! Totally flawed science ::: no cures over how many years now? Shameful! 😡,As president of the University put an end to all animal experiments and free the dogs to PETA. These experiments are abusive and hurtful and need to stop immediately.

Medical records show that even as a puppy::: he suffered extensively. He gradually lost weight and became ever weaker. At just a year old::: he already struggled to stand on his hind legs.

Ned::: who was speckled with black markings::: never had a real home.

Medical records show that even as a puppy::: he suffered extensively. He gradually lost weight and became ever weaker. At just a year old::: he already struggled to stand on his hind legs.

"Updates regarding summer New Student Conferences from New Student and Family Programs:

New Aggie
March 30 at 2:00 PM ·

An Announcement Regarding Summer New Student Conferences:

In consultation with Texas A&M University leadership::: we have decided the required portions of the New Student Conference (NSC) will be a fully virtual experience with an option for campus visit day later in the summer. Factors we considered in this decision include the large size of the incoming class::: facility and capacity restraints::: and challenges associated with hosting students::: families::: and other guests in large numbers. While the COVID-19 pandemic is improving::: we believe this decision is in the best interest of students::: families and our staff.

Texas A&M University
Texas A&M Division of Student Affairs",2021-03-31 09:33:00,Extremely disappointed in A&M. This is not following the science. This is just wrong and a great disservice to incoming freshman. Universities need to care about the mental health of all students. Zoom does not work. Canceling does not help. These kids need in person interaction. Mental health matters. Give students and families a choice. Everyone in Texas who wants a vaccination is able to get one. Open up. If you want our tuition dollars::: open the doors and do your job - educate our children in person! Shame on you Texas A&M.,I’m nervous as my daughter starts July 6th and I don’t want July 5th to be the first day she starts getting used to the campus.,"So disappointed in A&M for this decision. I’ve been paying full tuition on 2 Aggies to have online classes. With no reduction in tuition for these classes even though they are not taking up classroom space::: heat/AC::: toilet paper::: etc..
Now::: I have an incoming freshman & his NSC is virtual!
Texas A&M we deserve better than this!","So you have an outdoor make-up graduation ceremony for 2020 students and their families at Kyle Field::: where no one gets tested. But you test everyone coming back from Spring Break? Why not say “Hey if you want to participate in-person for new student conferences::: you have to get tested or show proof of a full vaccine?” Isn’t that a reasonable compromise so the university feels like it’s covered it’s responsibility to its students and everyone else feels comfortable? Because that’s what this is about at this point. Making people feel comfortable without any true science supporting it. Yes the virus is real. But the response to “cancel” things makes no sense anymore. We are going back and forth to cause further confusion and chaos. University leadership needs to change now::: or we are going to lose students en mass.

I better not see full capacity at Kyle Field for games in the fall if this is the line the administration is taking either. I’m disgusted.",My ‘future’ Aggie is waitlisted. We would be so very very happy to have any Texas A&M NSC::: in person or otherwise! Please don’t make us wait any longer. Gig ‘em! 😜😀👍,Very disappointed. Please reconsider and give students a choice to attend in person or virtually. Numbers are going down and this is still more than 2 months away.,No!. So disappointed A&M. These young people are ready to go back to school. They are ready to beigin the next stage of their life. They do not want to do this behind a screen and as a parent I do not want to pay for tuition if my child will be behind a screen. It is time to open fully and get back to traditions and classroom teaching.,As a former student part of my heart is really happy my son is going somewhere else and hopefully Aggieland would grow a pair and stop this direction. Watch them fill the football 🏈 stadium 🏟 this Fall bc money talks!,Very disappointing. Cost adjustments need to be made to reflect online/virtual events::: conferences::: camps and most importantly classes.,So disappointed with this decision. We need to get back to normalcy for our kids!!,Terrible decision. With herd immunity on the cusp and Vaccines now available for anyone who wants one in Texas::: I truly believe this decision should be reconsidered. NSC gives students so much more than just a time to create a schedule::: it also allows them to connect with other students as well as fe Connected to campus. Please::: please::: at least give the option of in person as well as virtual.,Bonehead moves like this are why I stopped giving to the Former Student Association. I know they can live without my money::: but I cannot support an institution that isn't thinking with their brain and has become deeply liberalized.,"Ned::: a German shorthaired pointer::: was born in a laboratory nine years ago. He was purposely bred to have canine muscular dystrophy.
For nearly a decade experimenters at Texas A&M University tormented him in pointless studies.
He has finally been euthanised::: ending his life of pain. Please release the other dogs as you agreed to with Peta::: then going back on your word.",Very disappointed that they have decided to not have in person orientation especially since the Covid numbers are going down.,"Good job A&M! Following COVID-19 guidelines and listening to the people who know about infectious diseases is absolutely the right mindset. As an institute of higher learning::: if you don't set the example that knowledge is second to none::: you have no business trying to educate the next generation. All of these people complaining about their feelings and emotions are ridiculous.

I'm glad an institute like A&M will continue to hold my respect because they listen to those who know better. Wisdom is strong in the leadership at A&M while all of these snowflakes complain about their feelings.","This decision is very disappointing! It would be nice if you would reconsider and give families options. Allow those that are comfortable to come for in person NSC and those that are not comfortable to do it virtually.

Offering a visit later in the summer does not work for our family and may not for others. We scheduled our vacation time around our student’s NSC date and those vacation dates can not be changed. Also only allowing one parent to come later in the summer is a major disappointment for families.

Covid numbers are dropping and by June will be even lower. Please reconsider this decision!",So disappointed by this decision. Give people the choice to attend in person. Baseball game was filled with people last night.,Very disappointed in this decision by Texas A&M. The impact this poor decision has on students (including my daughter) seems to have been given no consideration in making this decision.,I am sure that the school did not make this decision lightly and it is sadly not shocking at the rude comments that are being posted here. The school is doing their best for this and many other things to provide the best and safest opportunity for their students. Things are getting better::: slowly::: and there is light at the end of the tunnel. We need to support the University in their efforts. They are clearly moving to a more normal situation for next year and doing their best. This last year has been hard on everyone in many different ways across the world. Together we will succeed.,The kids deserve fish camp::: regular registration::: normal Texas A&M. It should be the best time of their life. Hopefully the Board of Regents replace these administrators that are making bad decisions!,A&M leadership is not the same as it once was. I have looked forward to my children going to school in college station for years. Always appreciated the conservative values. Starting to look like The University of Texas in College Station!,As both a former student and a mother to an incoming freshman::: I am very disappointed in this decision. Please reconsider. We can mitigate the Covid risk AND have in-person orientation. We have MANY choices when it comes to higher education-we choose Texas A&M because of the student experience. Please do not rob another class of the joy of being an Aggie when we have the power to choose differently.,So if they are doing this is family day still a go,I don’t see this as such a big deal. NSC was 2 days of long meetings sitting in by an auditorium. Sitting at home and doing it remotely would be a relief. Did the NSC 2 times and never got to tour our dorms or interact much with other kids. It’s not Fish Camp. For all you incoming Freshmen parents::: this school is guided by SCIENCE. If this bothers you this much now::: remember Hwy 6 runs both ways! My daughter is graduating undergrad in Biomedical Sciences and moving on to graduate school. A&M is considered a role model across the nation in how to manage this virus situation and keep educating our kids. Schools have come from all over the nation to see how it’s being done. Is it ideal? No. Is it the college experience we all want for our kids? No::: but we will all have to get over it and just move forward as best we can.,I think this is unnecessary and not a good decision. Disappointed in Aggie staff leadership,Disappointed that our leadership does not see the value of the in person conference to make it an option for those persons wanting to attend::: many of which will be vaccinated by that time. Online could remain an option for others. If getting vaccinated does not remove all of these requirements::: then what does? These students need normalcy as the transition is difficult enough in the best of circumstances!,Sadly the best decision for now.,Then stop charging them $150 to accept their admission and for the in person new student conference experience they don’t truly get.,As an incoming freshman::: this decision is very disappointing but I understand TAMU’s reasoning. I just wish both in person and virtual options were available.,"Don’t understand how other colleges of the same size can manage in person and give incoming students the choice of virtual/ in person .
Think they may lose kids bc if this",Does this apply to the Galveston campus or just College Station?,Just like a tax is never repealed::: once they get their foot in the door::: it is impossible to close it. The Governor's Executive Order GA-34 eliminated the State restrictions on capacity::: so it is Texas A&M's decision to both require facility capacity restrictions and require Covid testing. This is clearly a Texas A&M cost elimination plan::: while continuing to raise the tuition and fees as if all classes and activities are attended in person. This is only a decision in the best interests of the school::: not the students or those paying for the services.,Sounds to me like some are just too lazy to do their jobs anymore!,Is the college education of the incoming fish going to be greatly affected by the NSC being virtual? Will it lessen the quality of their degrees? I bet by going to classes over the next four years::: they can overcome this if they work really hard at their studies. This to me::: appears to be a meaningless concern.,Our classes (not many) this summer are only online.,Is this for TAMUG as well? We were supposed to go around June 1.,Ridiculous. So many young Aggies make friends at the NSC.,So disappointed in leadership. The students need IN PERSON events::: instruction and interaction.,What a let down. Hard for new students to get exited about attending when every corner they turn they get shot down.,Anyone see the crowd they had last night for the Aggie vs tu baseball game??,3000 at the Aggie baseball game which is more than the nsc,I bet ya'll fill up that football stadium though . Tamu loves that $$$,This is terrible! What about TRADITION?,This is ridiculous Texas is 100% open! Start showing some leadership and move forward!,Please reconsider::: A&M!! If you can make other in-person events happen in the upcoming schedule::: you can do this! You’re testing all of our students constantly — why not do that for NSC students??? Enough of this virtual stuff!!!!,But you had football games last fall. Cool::: that makes sense.,So ridiculous!! TAMU used to be a leader...now just following. 😕👎🏼,Any refund or partial refund of the 225.00 that we paid???,Release these poor 20 imprisoned dogs !!!,"Run!!!!
Hide!!!!
Stay in bed!!!
Buy a hazmat suit!!
Everyone become “bubbleboys”!!!

This is not acceptable A&M!!!!!
You’re no longer a “leader”!!",You mean virtual signaling.,"Free cannoli and the other dogs in the lab. You offered him up for adoption but then shipped him to another lab. He deserves a chance to be surrounded by people who love him and will not torture him.

"Mandatory COVID-19 testing begins today for students in classes that are only offered face-to-face in Bryan-College Station. Aggies in this group should get their quick::: free test on campus by the end of the day on April 2.

Learn more about the testing program::: as well as how you can volunteer at one of the campus testing sites::: here: tx.ag/Update0322
Find on-campus testing locations: tx.ag/GetTested",2021-03-29 09:12:00,Fantastic! Keep the students and faculty as safe as possible.,This is getting out of control. My daughter has been picked 3 times for the random testing::: done the mandatory test at the beginning of the semester and the mandatory test a week or so ago. All times she has been negative. She's not taking the vaccine either::: she's a very healthy person and has been all her life. I understand it's serious and can die from it. I had the virus and I am high risk qith other health issues and I still believe this is all over kill in a lot of ways.,Both my husband & I are alumni. This is so disappointing to see. The students pose hardly any risk::: and cases continue to decline. Plus there have been successful treatments this whole time. 🙄What’s next?? Mandatory cv vax in the fall?? Students- y’all better wake up.,My guess is that by the fall neither students::: faculty or employees will be allowed on campus without proof of vaccination,Just because they are negative a given morning::: doesn't mean they won't come in contact with it and get it that afternoon & evening. It is ludicrous and a waste of $$,That is all kinds of wrong with required testing!,Why are they mandatory testing?,It's the public service task.welldone.,Mandatory A for all students for their classes once they get the Vaccine! 😂🙄,Wouldn't offering the vaccine be a better way to go? Frequent testing doesn't fix anything.,No one else picked up in the typo? Too bad their aren’t better people proofreading these.,West Texas ATM don't mandate us getting the test unless you feel sick to go get it done.,So how many lives are yall going to mess up with yalls false negatives?,And there going find out how al this works too:::,Absolutely ridiculous!!,So what about the next week and the next etc? Are they testing every student everyday before class?,How dare you! 😔,Oh my! Test #9 for my child?! 🤣🤣🤣,"Seriously...hav
e you received an answer?",Laura Finley Griffin,Damn! Guess y'all drank the koolaid! 😂😂😂,No thank you::: that is all,"Sure are a lot of science::: medical::: epidemiologists
experts commenting. What’s so terrible about students being tested? Its not like they’re asking them to commit a crime. Why not think of it as doing your part to get out of this pandemic?",So will they be tested daily - every other day - weekly because you can test negative one day and positive the next. JW,Have they even looked at the numbers of positive cases and deaths? We are at the bottom of the curve. So why are they mandatory testing now when numbers are better than they’ve ever been? And in the age population that is the lowest risk to begin with? Makes no sense. Sad that they’ve sold out - I had hoped since they tended toward conservative values that they wouldn’t buy into the lies.,Ridiculous!!! 😡,Jan Duncan Weir,Or what?,Texas A&M University Luckily there are other schools to attend. Just a bummer love your tradition prior COVID,Billy Bob Moczygemba,Ridiculous...,Has anyone in the science department looked at the numbers ?!? Sorry Ags not with the admin on this! Someone is banking off all this testing just sayn. We have drank the koolaid. 🤨,"If Covid was still a serious problem::: the Biden Administration wouldn't be releasing Covid positive illegals back into the population. Our town had over 100 positive cases in January::: and now we are in the single digits daily. This is ALL POLITICAL. Like it has been since the beginning. It's sad to see how much people will willingly give up just to feel ""safe""!","Sometimes it’s worth thinking outside the box. This video is enlightening. Well worth the watch.

dyc",Mandatory papers coming soon. Better be in line with the gestapo.,I'm sure next they'll roll out mandatory STD testing. Or Mandatory Ebola testing. Or mandatory Measles testing.,Pathogen testing is for people that are ill::: so ill they require medical treatment from a physician. Period.,Mandatory testing when we have flattened the curve almost all the way? Overkill. Knee jerk. Sucks for the students and parents. Why is A&M caving? Gross.,My Freedom Card was established in 1776.,"Jesus Christ... how is a college this dumb? That just sorta checks that at one point in time they weren’t infected (ignoring how unreliable the tests are)
It also is ignoring the fact that 78% of covid hospitalization
were over weight individuals::: so most college students would be fine regardless

I know A&M is doing this to appease the overly fearful people but I wish they would be smarter",Ridiculous. Testing young people for something that isn’t dangerous to them in the first place.,Covid-19 has a 99.98% survival rate,Why not mandatory flu shot as well?,"Look for yourself

these are the PRC tests they want our children to take::: they contain a dangerous cancer causing chemical called ETHYLENE OXIDE
- The same chemical that’s in the mask.
(Check the comments)

I do not want this up mine or my daughters nose::: do you?

Just use the magic word “EXEMPT” - it might save your life.

He has marked many with his beautiful legacy. May this deserved tribute be eternal!!! ❤,Happy for your Mr.Norman unforgetable birth day.which inserted in a tradition and created a legacy. 107 an outstanding DAY.,"Amen

"Beginning Monday::: March 29::: everyone 16 and older will be eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine. Texas A&M Student Health Services is receiving doses that are available to students and employees::: and you can now schedule your vaccine appointment on campus or in Brazos County: http://tx.ag/Update0324

Schedule your vaccine appointment through Student Health Services here: http://tx.ag/COVIDVaccine

Schedule a vaccine appointment through the Brazos County Community COVID-19 Vaccination Hub here: http://tx.ag/BrazosHub",2021-03-24 22:21:41,They are charging $15 a dose on a vaccine A&M received for free. A&M is literally making a profit! My Aggie was going to go get her vaccine but will now wait till she’s home in May where she can get it for free by the city here. Shame on them for trying to make a profit off of this! 🤦‍♀️,I am a health care provider with Asthma and bad allergies. So far so good with the Modern Vaccine. I have not grown a third eye or had significant problems. The vaccine will maybe cause mild symptoms but not kill you like the disease. Truly the severity of the type of Covid you get is a crap shoot. I was not willing to risk. I have seen my share of mild illness and severe near death Covid disease. If you ask me I strongly support taking the shot.,I had COVID. That is the worst illness I have ever had. I was out of work for three weeks and fatigued for weeks after that. I have already had shot 1 and get the second tomorrow. You do NOT want to get this virus. It is not just a flu. My oxygen level went down to 85%. I lost 14 lbs in the first 2 weeks. I was a previously healthy 51 yr old running 5ks. Now I have to rebuild my stamina so I can walk a 5 k.,Texas is the best! In New York it is impossible to get vaccines or appointment the distribution is super slow...,The elderly need this vaccine and those with compromised immune systems not healthy 20 year olds.,"Once a student is vaccinated::: are they required to quarantine after an exposure?
(The Texas A&M COVID Policy doesn’t currently address this)",Anybody? Or is for A&M students???,nothing like scrolling through the comments about something positive::: like aiding the public health to see the ignorant vitriol of some ppl who supposedly went to one of the greatest academic institutions on the planet.... Gig'em!,Does this count for Blinn Professor?,Probably been asked somewhere but is the vaccine going to be mandatory for on campus students next year?,Are you still requiring insurance card to bill insurance for admin fee? Texas A&M University,This shot is not a vaccine and doesn’t fit into the category of vaccines! They have even confessed that this shot was put out because people would not be satisfied without having something. This shot actually causes havoc on your immune system and introduces illness into your body that isn’t there previous. Again do your research. Do you know that the majority of the people in government haven’t even received the shot? They aren’t taking it. Why is that?,Is it the Johnson and Johnson vaccine?,Young people!! Before you decide to take a vaccine that was fast-tracked by skipping key animal testing first::: please consider the pros and cons. Just sayin...,WHY??? Virtually no one at this age is dying from covid. Or even getting severely ill. Why take a vaccine that has not been proven safe?,I may have missed it::: but which vaccine is it?,Just curious which vaccine is it ? Moderna?,good thing too! 2 more weeks and all the students would be dead!!!,Why is Texas::: Texas A&M out of all places trying to push this poison on our youth????,"Say "" YES"" to vaccine and NO to covid 19.",Stop the guinea pig mentality😬👎🏻,Excellent news!! Get vaccinated::: Aggies!,My son has already been vaccinated::: does he need to notify the campus?,Amen 🙏,Tami Cooper Mataga,Gage Gardner,For an institute of higher learning::: there are too many ignorant people in these comments.,what about Galveston?,Musarrat Shahid,Cynthia Benton,Avione Davenport Maria Davenport,Lindsey Muenchow,Shelby Lewis,Madelyn Guevara,Payton Arrott Garhett Wyatt,Lisa Brieden Vargo,Brian Lowe,"Research these vaccines::: then make a decision.

March 24 at 10:56 AM ·

The Big Event Texas A&M University is back this weekend! More than 10:::000 students have signed up to give back to the Bryan-College Station community::: with some modifications to keep students and community members safe.

Read more in this note from Interim President Junkins: http://tx.ag/Junkins0324",2021-03-24 16:58:09,Giving back to the community is part of the Aggie experience.,This was a wonderful experience for my '96 and '98 Aggies. Glad to see it happen this year.,As far as I understand isn't it a loss for university regarding the majority of the students went back to other college.? Think over on this.,Wait::: I thought covid was still so bad that the university needs mandatory testing. Are we sure that the students should really be sent out to people's homes if that's the case?,"asesinos de animales
Basta yaaa!",So excited to have the students here this year! They always do a great job and are a pleasure to be with.,"The ""animal people"" who love to harass and truly have no ideas of their own must not be able to get any response on their on FB page...should tell them they are spitting into the wind!","Free cannoli and the other dogs in the lab. You offered him up for adoption but then shipped him to another lab. He deserves a chance to be surrounded by people who love him and will not torture him.

There are professors::: custodians::: food services::: clerks::: advisors l::: and EVERYONE ELSE in the Bryan/College Station area!

TAMU is an institution of higher learning::: yet some of y'all seem convinced the advice of literally EVERY expert in the medical field is wrong. Y'all are straight up embarrassing.",They’re just doing their best to keep everyone on their campus healthy. These are different times. Gig ‘Em!👍🏻,Multiple decisions::: this one for example::: the university has made... and the association of former students wonders why I don’t wish to donate. I am so disappointed in the shift of direction this university has taken !,C’mon. Time to move on and be done with this crap. My son is a senior and he has missed out on face to face classes for the last year! (And tuition has not dropped a penny by the way.) Sad for all these students that are missing out on the same college experience that we had. Enough already!!,I think this is great. Kudos to Texas A&M for this,I’m so tired of “doing something just to make it look like we are doing something”. This is ridiculous. This is about as effective as making students carry clear backpacks to prevent gun violence.,Meningitis vaccines are required to protect students. I see no problem with requiring testing for Covid or the vaccine::: once there are enough doses available.,I’m fairly certain that this won’t stand up in court were some educated Aggie to challenge it::: just as the vaccine cannot be made mandatory. Disappointed to say the least. As someone who works in the medical field and has seen Covid up close and personal::: I can tell you that the tests they are probably using have a ridiculous rate of false negative results. But that doesn’t seem to matter to anyone nowadays::: as long as the school gets a pat on the back and pandemic funding. These tests are not given to get the results::: they are given to achieve a false sense of security and remove liability from A&M were a student to get the virus. I see it with employers::: too. They just want to be able to check the box.,"Y’all making everyone take HIV and Hepatitis tests as well?! That could save lives!!

..... no wonder they make “Aggie” jokes. Such a poor reflection on my former school.","When was the flu shot ever a mandatory test.... this is against our Constitutional rights as citizens of this country ..
No where in our Constitution does it say that we are to mandatory test... ?
This is not constitutional .. you need to run your institution by not only how the state of Texas was originally founded ::: but by the way this Republic was originally founded by our forefathers in 1776.
God bless America! 🇺🇸","Why stop there?

And how about some cancer scans too?

I think you guys are onto something.

Let’s add mental health screenings::: STD tests::: BMI tests.",Ridiculous. As soon as the student leaves a quarantined area after testing::: they could be exposed to the virus.,"Let’s see if I understand correctly. Mandatory testing! I believe it is correct that the test is good for that moment in time.
So.... what about the next day::: then the next? Should not we test every day? Perhaps every morning and evening?
So what is the Objective and the End game?",Does anyone know why they are doing this now? Are they having a surge? Feeling like my younger aggie has already had more tests than any human should have to take. Poor kid. 🤣,"Let’s let the medical consultants and leaders at A&M decide what needs to be done to help keep students safe. Do it for everyone. Quityergritchin

Here’s your test::: swab your own mouth::: all y’all drop into this bag and we will contact you in a few days - but continue to be on campus and go to class till we let you know!!!!!,When will people wake up and stand up for themselves.NO ONE can make you take a covid test,Wow. I’m going to start selling Kool-aid on this page and get rich! This type of blanket testing is less than worthless. Someone who is in the first 2-3 days of infection will test negative::: giving a false sense of security. If someone tests and then goes to the grocery store::: the test result is immediately worthless because of the new exposure. Universal precautions and educating people to get tested and stay home after a known contact or new suspicious symptoms would be much more beneficial. Money is involved here for someone making policy decisions.,Would be awesome if they could also offer the vaccine to our students! I hear they are doing that at the University of Illinois,This is ridiculous. Nice way to strip away the basic rights of people.,This is shameful. And::: why now? When are we actually going to start looking at numbers and realize that it is time to move on.,So disappointed in the university for doing this - it is a ridiculous waste of time and money (tax dollars especially). College age students have a far likelier chance of being hit by a bus than dying or even being seriously sick from this virus. I expected more support for freedom but then again the admin is scared of lawsuits - which is why they kill off all the old traditions 🙁,Thank you Texas A&M for caring about your students::: staff and community. This helps to prevent the students from creating more variants. 'Gig Em!,"Brilliant.

Force everyone::: regardless if they have beaten the virus or not::: to take a test that is not accurate.

The PCR test is not able to detect whether the viral RNA has come from a living virus or a dead one. A large proportion of the so-called positives are::: in fact::: “cold” positives: they’re correctly identifying that there is some viral RNA in the sample – but it’s from a dead virus. It can’t hurt them::: they’re not going to get ill::: they can’t transmit it to anybody else. So they’re not infectious. So that accounts for a large number of the so-called positive cases.

These are people who’ve beaten the virus. Why are we using this test that cannot distinguish between active infection and people who’ve conquered the virus?

Why? Control.

Former VP of Phizer with Facts::: I recommend anyone considering a vaccine listen to an expert with decades of experience in the field::: over the politicians and appointed officials.

Healthy students nonetheless!,Should be illegal,"Really disappointed by the rhetoric on this thread...our University wants to test people for a potentially lethal disease in order to facilitate continued learning and other core functions::: including many of the traditions we value. We should be grateful they have the resources to facilitate this. How does this policy harm anyone? Testing is an annoyance at most. While it is not a panacea::: it can help stop the spread::: especially by identifying asymptomatic carriers who could otherwise still spread the virus. Somehow COVID became a litmus test on our political tribes::: supplanting common sense with vitriol and partisan snark. Masks::: testing::: physical distancing::: vaccination...n

F U A&M!,Rectal swab??,Did Dr Fauci start teaching there?,"Ned::: a German shorthaired pointer::: was born in a laboratory nine years ago. He was purposely bred to have canine muscular dystrophy. For nearly a decade experimenters at Texas A&M University tormented him in pointless studies. Ned::: who was speckled with black markings::: never had a real home. He never lived anywhere but in a kennel::: and as the disease attacked his body::: he lost what little control he had over his life. Medical records show that even as a puppy::: he suffered extensively. He gradually lost weight and became ever weaker. At just a year old::: he already struggled to stand on his hind legs. His medical records document his reduced flexibility and mobility as the years progressed—and also reveal the experiments and repeated muscle biopsies that he was subjected to.

Ned was euthanized on January 8::: 2021::: finally ending nine years and seven months of unmitigated pain. While it’s too late for him::: there are still 20 dogs at the university—many
of whom are healthy—who also had been part of the canine MD colony and who deserve to be adopted into homes where they can know love and comfort. No amount of research money is worth such cruelty. Shut down the worthless dog laboratory!",Shame on you Texas A&M.,And that's why you go to a and m . Dumb people with money need to feel important.,Release your experimental dogs. Inhumane you all deserve less. Waste of a university,I have several issues surrounding this mandatory testing A&M is implementing. 1) they didn't do mandatory testing in the fall semester when the threat of Covid was much greater. Instead they still had football games with thousands of spectators. For people saying this is A&M caring about the community::: consider that. 2) they are doing this right after a joke of a spring break. For the tests to be accurate about if a student has contracted covid while on spring break they need to wait at least a week for the virus to be on their system before the test can be accurate. 3) they are testing 40:::000 people within a week and half M-F from 9 to 5. This means the lines are going to be long. People are not going to stand in a long line outside wearing a mask::: making the testing sites more of a hazard than a help. 4) you have to get tested at one of the A&M sites. You can't go to your doctor to get tested you can only get the ones approved by A&M who have already proven they make poor decisions::: see points 1 thru 3. 5) as A&M themselves states when they sent the email about mandatory testing the test is only an accurate account of that exact moment. Giving people a negative test gives them the impression that they no longer have to be diligent with other things such as social distancing. All of this adds up to a terrible decision that honestly makes me as a student feel like nothing more than a lab rat. If you support this then by all means I invite you to schedule an appointment within the next 3 days no matter what else you had planned and stand in a long line on a hot or rainy day for information that's outdated before you even get your results back.

""There is no room in this country for hyphenated Americanism. When I refer to hyphenated Americans::: I do not refer to naturalized Americans. Some of the very best Americans I have ever known were naturalized Americans::: Americans born abroad. But a hyphenated American is not an American at all ... The one absolutely certain way of bringing this nation to ruin::: of preventing all possibility of its continuing to be a nation at all::: would be to permit it to become a tangle of squabbling nationalities::: an intricate knot of German-American

Maybe y’all just don’t like folks who don’t look like you,The whole dramatic increase in asian hate crime narrative being pushed by the media and Democrats is false. There were increases in the number of hate crimes against Asians in 2020 but the numbers went from rare to slightly less rare. Look up the numbers. The percent increase looks huge because the overall numbers are so small. These crimes are also most often committed by black men not Trump loving white supremacists as they want us to believe. The shooter in Georgia has said he was targeting sexually oriented businesses that he claims fueled his sex addiction and race was not a factor.,I find it very ironic that this school says it cares about people of color. That couldn't be further from the truth. They invite white supremacists to come speak and spread hate. Their classrooms don't even reflect the population of Texas. They dismantled programs to help minorities under trump. This school couldn't care less about Asians or anyone else::: recognize it for what it is::: a PR stunt.,The real and documented discrimination of Asian Americans is from liberal institutions of so called higher learning admissions. Maybe we should wait and let the investigation play out before jumping to convenient conclusions.,How about supporting ALL students!,"To John Junkins and Annie McGowan:
The investigators have stated that what occurred in Atlanta was not a hate crime::: and was not based on race at all. This person was mentally ill sexually.

Get a grip. It has not been proven to be an anti-Asian attack::: yet. Wait for the ink to dry on the investigation before you start putting out more divisive racist rhetoric.,Why? The police said this was NOT a racially motivated incident. Why do you want to make it one?,"If this was racially motivated::: why didn’t he also shoot up nail salons::: Asian owned restaurants::: the Asian grocery stores::: or other Asian owned businesses in the same area?

He targeted massage parlors specifically. Is it still racially motivated if he would have only killed White people that worked at those same massage parlors? NO. Because we sure aren’t hearing about the two White people that were also killed. He targeted massage parlors because everyone in America knows they are known for prostitution. People in buildings are easy targets.

Stop making this about race.",God and scripture say there is only one race and only Two genders . And the world says God does not exist.

"Students from Texas A&M College of Nursing are stepping up in a time of need and selflessly serving their community by administering the COVID-19 vaccine at the Brazos County Hub vaccination center!

"A mandatory student testing program begins at Texas A&M on March 23::: which is meant to quickly isolate students::: slow the spread::: and increase our odds for in-person events::: graduation ceremonies::: The Big Event::: and other student activities.

The testing program only applies to students in the Bryan-College Station area::: and requires students to get tested if they live on campus::: are on-campus employees::: or are in classes only offered face-to-face.

This strategy proved very effective following a Halloween uptick last semester. St. Patrick’s Day is followed almost immediately by a three-day holiday weekend for A&M faculty::: students::: and staff — a time when events known to have behaviors that contribute to the spread of the virus can take place. This also helps to reduce the burden on area hospitals by slowing the spread.

Students will take a test consisting of spitting into a vial::: except those who have symptoms::: feel ill::: or may have been exposed to COVID-19::: who should take a mouth swab test at the on-campus Curative kiosks or at the A.P. Beutel Health Center.

Students who can document that they tested positive for COVID-19 on or after Jan. 1::: 2021::: are not required to take the test.

Read more about the program beginning March 23: tx.ag/TestingNote21",2021-03-15 09:50:00,Thank you TAMU for policy driven by science! We’re grateful for measures that keep our kiddo in the classroom.,What about students who are already vaccinated? My son is vaccinated and lives on campus - will he still need to test?,When did the Neo-Nazis take over A&M? Threatening graduation ceremonies if their testing demands aren’t met. Insane.,I am very disappointed to see AGGIES fall for this bs,"I’m so grateful to TAMU for doing what they need to do to keep classes in person. I have another daughter in Austin and 5% of the classes are in person! She had no in person classes at all last semester and has ONE in person class this semester that meets every other week::: one time a week::: for 3 hours. It’s very sad. I read over and over on their parent FB groups that depression and anxiety are at an all time high.. kids isolated in dorms. Almost all of the activities are virtual.
I‘ve read about kids posting in social media groups::: just looking for someone to take a walk with because they haven’t had the opportunity to meet anyone. A&M has done what they need to do to get these kids back in the classroom and I’m so thankful.👍🏻",My student is an athlete that lives on campus and already gets tested at least weekly. This week he is testing twice on consecutive days. Is there a way for him to use the athletic department administered test results to meet this mandatory requirement?,Thank you TAMU for your leadership and common sense science driven policy. This is how we keep each other safe and end this pandemic. Thankful to be an Aggie and an Aggie parent.,Thank you::: A&M::: for doing what you can to keep the students::: faculty and staff safe!,Thank you TAMU! Seeing that Italy is in lockdown again is enough for me to know we have to TRY our best and STOP the spread not slow it.,"Stop.testing.pe
ople.that.are.n
ot.sick.

If you have a fever stay home. This is abuse of scientific method::: PCR tests were never intended to be used in this way.",Thank you Texas A&M for following the science and not the Qtard driven politics we currently endure in our great state!,Thank you::: Texas A&M::: for keeping my husband safe while teaching in person. Thus::: keeping my family healthy❤️,The people complaining about this being a political ploy with no real efficacy would be the loudest screechers if the University or other governmental institutions implemented the sort of hardline measures that kept other countries from experiencing lasting outbreaks.,"I hope you all realize that we are NEVER going to eliminate this and it has a 99.8% survival rate.

Let us live as normal. If you are fearful::: stay home. Period.
I have no desire to force YOUR choices. Please stop transferring your fear unnecessarily. Seriously.",if half the people complaining (that don’t even go here) would take this seriously and do the bare minimum to protect others::: we wouldn’t be dealing with mandates and testing::: because giving a damn about others is free but somehow they missed the memo.,I have to do this at my graduate school and it works amazing! Our rates are super low and you feel comfortable having the peace of mind that you and everyone around you are safe and not spreading it. So proud to be a former student::: way to go TAMU 👍🏽,Do not support institutions interfering with personal rights or “directing” medical tests. Significant infringement of personal rights.,"Real question- how much longer can we “slow the spread?”
One year ago we were taking “two weeks” off to “flatten the curve.”","I notice that people who have a negative opinion on getting tested aren’t even students? How about y’all let us::: actual and current students::: continue getting tested because we truly don’t mind? It takes 5 min of our time and helps keep things around campus open and safe for everyone (preventing “isolation”). Also::: they give us free tee shirts and stuff (who doesn’t like free tees).
If current students aren’t complaining::: people who aren’t students have no business doing so.
Thanks and Gig Em!",FREEDOM is no longer here either. Good grief!,I think they're trying to prevent what's going on with Duke and other colleges that have outbreaks. Error on the side of caution. My son does better in-person than virtual. Test away!,I wonder how often they will test. Is the government footing the bill?,I do not understand the reasoning behind this. Yes::: I have read the article but unless every single one of these people who force to take the test do NOT interact with anyone else than the results of said test will not in any way make anyone safer. If they go home for the weekend they run the risk of contracting it and bringing it back. are you going to continue testing? an initial test only works for things like a one time incident. such as travel into a specific place. Like having to be negative to fly into a country and still having to be negative to fly back into your home country. But attending classes every day repeatedly with normal life and work and social interactions is not going to be protected by a one time initial test. It is a huge waste of fiscal resources.,"This must be guidance by that feckless interim president who delivered the worst graduation speech in history on Saturday......a
bsolutely useless!",So many lazy people in these comments want the pandemic to be over while also not doing anything to try and make it so. Masks? Social distancing? Too lazy to contribute the bare minimum yet they’re getting mad because precautions are still being taken to keep people alive.,Mandatory::: that’s a joke. What’s the punishment for not getting tested?,When does this end? Enough already,Let’s not have to miss another graduation! Whoop!👍🏻,My one question is about fully vaccinated students. If those who have recovered from COVID-19 are not required to test::: why should those who are vaccinated::: since vaccines provide stronger immunity?,Just ridiculous! Students have rights to choose medical testing if they have symptoms! A&M continues to use their student body for research.,I personally think you do not need something shoved up your nose over and over again there needs to be a better test to swab like they test for flu,My daughter will be in dorm there this summer—hope sincerely she will have access to vaccine—if meningitis is required to live in dorm::: why not Covid...I want her to have as normal of experience as possible...,Getting tested one day doesn’t make one negative or positive the next day or week!,is the testing for those with symptoms only? or are you testing at random and asymptomatic students?,So many 🤡 on here. just be glad they aren’t requiring your student to get the vaccine (at least not yet..🧐),This is a huge overreach,What if we’re fully vaccinated?,Another useless::: political ploy to make the university look good::: all while accomplishing nothing. 🙄,How about mandatory face to face classes!!,"When is Texas A&M going to start addressing the bigger issue of hopelessness and isolation the students feel because of your ""safety guidelines""? How many students is enough to call that a pandemic?",Numbers are dropping and now they pull this crap. Show me the numbers that justify this.,Better test everyday then::: otherwise this is useless. Let's just put 2 bubbles around campus. The outter bubble is where all people and things go to quarantine before entry to the inner bubble. The outter bubble opens to the outside world on the 1st of every month. Then people and things can go to the inner bubble on the 30th of every month. Once you enter the outter bubble::: your only option is to move into the inner bubble. Once you are in the inner bubble::: you can never leave.,I thought they had no spring break so this wouldn't be an issue?,People won’t wear a mask but will volunteer their DNA for free.,What if they’ve been vaccinated?,Maybe this will be the last time,Thank you A&M for looking out for our kids!,What is the point of this?,Enough already!,For what else are they going to start mandatory testing?,Why not get all vaccinated?,Can we stop the testing madness already!!!,Do better::: Texas A&M,University of Miami has been doing this all year.,Mandatory testing is BULLCRAP...,I hate that you waited so long for the event only to hear a poor speech.,HEIL!! When one believes their fear over truth::: they willingly will not only give up their freedom::: but everyone else's as well.,I guess it’s for the spring finals at the “School of Public Health at Texas A&M”. Lots of extrapolating and postulating to be done by the upper class men.,Stop the Dog cruetly let them be free by giving them in adoption centre this is sick 🤮🤮🤮,Morgan Brown spit in the damn tube::: go drink a beer at the chicken with your friends and thoroughly enjoy every second of the education you and your class mates earned and deserve. 👍🏽,A&M going full knee jerk liberal. Now testing for the flu.,Admin- remove Raymond Buxton- he’s a troll! See his post 👆🏻,99.8 recovery rate.,Omg! C’mon you idiots! Enough with using Covid as an excuse to impose on civil liberties and push fear mongering. Covid is obviously not a huge issue for White House Proxy since our borders are wide open! Also::: you’re not following the science. Read up on it. It changes every hour.,Fu!@ it::: test everyone::: everyday. Test away! Test Away!,It is so disappointing to see institutions forcing medical procedures on people. Are we back in the nazi era? This all part of the new Totalitarian government we have.,"Watch ""Shot in the Dark | Dr. Sherri Tenpenny"" on YouTube

I really enjoyed the words shared by Administration encouraging these students to research and fact find all that is going on in our great USA today. Do not just believe every TV media and social media post - study what you read (and hear) and apply the CORE VALUES A&M is based on and you will go far in life. These great men and women will be the ones shaping our world and fixing the mess it is in (where everyone is choosing sides rather than working together to find real solutions that make sense).

"Texas A&M will continue following The Texas A&M University System COVID-19 protocols first announced in October 2020 on testing::: face coverings::: physical distancing::: occupancy limits::: co-curricular activities::: and more.

Based on assessment of current conditions::: this step will help the university successfully complete the semester and is consistent with Gov. Greg Abbott’s order that masking and other protocols should be decided by institutions::: not by the state.

entities and not by the state! Gig’em!",Thank you TAMU!! Easy things like this that keep our kids in the classroom are good policy!,I’m good with keeping the protocols in place until the end of classes::: but Fall 2021 better open up like Fall 2019.,Love to see this. Proud to be an Ag! Thank you so much for your concern about our safety and well being.,And this is another reason why TAMU will no longer receive my donations. There is no peer reviewed study showing cloth masks are effective. Between this and your critical race theory nonsense::: you have lost me.,Thank you for using better judgment than our governor.,"Thank you TAMU for taking care of our students and the community...eas
y ways to be respectful to others and ourselves!!!","What’s the point in speaking negatively about their decision. We all like the university or we wouldn’t have either gone there (class of 90) or sent our kids there. Their intentions are meant to protect everyone::: it’s not to hurt anyone so let’s come together and support them and let our kids see this positive attitude of acceptance and support. By speaking negatively it effects how our students view their situation whether we realize it or not.
Gig Em!",Unbelievable. Most of the classes are still virtual how are they at risk. This decision is completely political!,Thank you for this responsible action and for taking care of students and staff.,Thank for for this common sense decision to help protect our children & their families!,I really hope that by the time the fall semester begins::: students are able to return to college normally - not the new normal.,"A great decision by Texas A&M administrators.
As a graduate of the School of Public Health::: I greatly appreciate the steps the system is taking to ensure the health and safety of current student::: faculty::: and staff. Thanks and Gig ‘Em!",Seriously thank you A&M! It means alot to see the school stand for rational guidelines to ensure the health and safety of students and faculty.,Thank you for making the intelligent and responsible decision even knowing that it would bring the nutters out of the woodwork.,Smart school doing smart things. I'm proud of them for considering the lives of others for a little longer.,Bravo! An institution that teaches science should follow the scientific protocols set down by the CDC.,Hoping this changes for fall and kids are back in the classroom. I’m getting tired of paying for virtual classes!!,"Pretty sad that the research and science you teach isn't actually followed. I cannot imagine being a student (let alone a world-renowned biochemist::: Molecular Biologist::: or Molecular Genetics Prof) and the face-palming they must be doing right now::: but I understand you have to cater to those who are afraid and don't understand science in order to keep away lawsuits and keep that ""covid research"" cash flowing in.",As a public Texas institution you should adhere to the Texas government’s policies and allow the men and women attending to make their own decisions about their health. Shame on you A&M.,I've never seen so many chicken littles. This is not the Fighting Texas Aggies that can actually think for themselves. Just a bunch of sheep.,Complete BS::: but not shocked. Typical of higher education these days!,Thank you for following the science and health protocols and not caving to political pressure.,Thank you A&M for following recommended guidelines and doing your part to keep our kids safe.,BS! If you want to wear a mask then go ahead but don’t tell me I have to wear it!,It should be decided by each individual person. Imagine that logic::: having the freedom to choose.,Very smart science and public health based decision,Isn't A&M a part of the state and the state has removed the mandate. Some CYA going on here and not leadership.,So::: a state sponsored and funded school will not adhere to state mandates? I'm a bit lost by this pompous post and assertive division.,It is never going to be the “right” time for those who love giving up their freedom!,Thank you::: our children have enough to worry about.,I guess that just goes to prove that Aggies can occasionally do something smart!,Seems like a very reasonable decision .,Thank you for keeping the students and staff safe.,Open up Evans. The chairs and couches literally piled on top of each other::: the taped off book shelves and closed study rooms are pretty annoying.,I am just thankful that I graduated from such a good school. If I had kids there I would agree with keeping the mask thing in place for a while longer.,Solid decision. Gig em!,I wish our kids::: who have a 99.9% recovery rate could get back to normal. Give them a choice.,Such a joke - how about if people want to wear a mask::: let them. And people who don’t::: don’t make them. Crazy concept right?,When your student body is insanely huge the odds are extremely high someone who is high risk is required to go onto campus to get some work done. Makes sense to me.,Thank you for putting the safety of Aggies first ..gig’ em,Thank you for keeping your community safe!,Thank you::: TAMU! A very sensible decision for both the faculty and student body! Gig ‘em::: Aggs! 👍🏻,Thank you UT clones.,But wearing a mask is so easy. I hate them but they can’t hurt,Thank you Texas A&M!,Good call! Gig ‘em!,I'm so glad. You're doing the right thing 💜,Thank you for keeping our kids safe!!!,Thank you::: TAMU! 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼,That is a blessing thank you I have two grandkids there,🌹🌹 Thankyou 🙏Will the University be getting vaccines accessible for students who are interested to take ?,Sad state... we should be leading not just being a sheep.,Sad::: the students should get to decide.,For those of you needing more proof of the statist takeover of A&M::: search no further.,Thank you ! You are indeed a responsible and premier institution we are all proud of...,Smart Aggies!! Thank you for your efforts to keep safe. 👍🏻,Thank you for this responsible action ✅,Is Fall 2021 semester will be taught remotely::: mix or F2F?,Thank you for not thinking people have common sense.,Thanks for doing the right thing::: TAMU!,Thanks for making the correct decision,Here’s hoping that the Fall gets rid of virtual classrooms.,"Translation: ""We're going to continue playing 'Covid Theater'!"" ;)",I just wanna be allowed to exercise in the rec without a mask on that’s all I ask😅,"Looks like masks are option on A&M Campus.

Abbott forbade local authorities from superseding his order. Only county judges can order COVID-19 restrictions if hospitalization
s from the virus rise above 15% of the bed capacity in that hospital region for seven straight days.

“The decision to require masks or otherwise impose COVID-19-relate
d operating limits is expressly reserved to private businesses on their own premises. It does not rest with jurisdictions like the city of Austin or Travis County or their local health authorities:::” Paxton wrote in a statement Wednesday.","UNMASK AGGIES!!! 👍🏻
99% covid recovery rate",Stupid. College age kids are the last people to be worried about and the profs can get vaccinated.,Thinking a strip of cloth will keep you from getting a virus is not being well informed. The virus can enter through the eye:::lot of exposed blood vessels::: the pores of the skin::: especially the scalp. As a former army NBC officer I can tell you my instructors would have laughed their asses off about a mask. DARPA the army research labs have some of the finest virology researchers in the world. Ask yourself why these people never commented about this. I know why. Just saying.,Open up!,You guys are successfully turning College Station into Austin... sad to see,"COVID hospitalization
s in literally every Trauma Service Area in Texas are down below the 15% threshold::: and yet you keep protocols in place.

Clearly your decision is a feel-good choice and not based in science.",TAMU doesn't give a crap about their minds::: their mental well being::: only the funding::: politics and they aren't the last man standing when it comes time to go against the grain!,"Join an awesome study to see if the BCG vaccine offers protection against COVID - see here for details https://

Glad to see a statue being added. 😊,The Monzingos raised a reveille also for those ags. Not like raising a good ole Baylor Bear 🐻. FYI.

Hall of Champions::: Kyle Field
REMARKS:
• Twenty-five percent of our students are first generation.
• And many more face equally great obstacles to accessing a college degree::: due to finances::: family situation or geographic location.
• Access to higher education is personal with me.
• I was raised in a small town in the middle of coal-mining country in eastern Kentucky.
• I understand firsthand what happens to a community and its youth when higher education seems unattainable.
• The generous support of donors like you is critically important to helping these students realize their dreams of a better life through education.
• We often talk proudly about Texas A&M and its history as a land grant institution.
• We were established to provide access to education for the working people::: those who may have been previously excluded.
• And because of land-grant universities like Texas A&M::: first-generatio
n college students like Luis have been given access to higher education in unprecedented numbers.
• I have served in my role for six years now and it has been a remarkable adventure.
• I’ve gained an Aggie son::: an Aggie son-in-law::: an Aggie soon-to-be daughter-in-law
::: and a bit of a Texas drawl.
• I have particularly enjoyed meeting with former students and learning how Texas A&M changed your life.
• You have told me stories about arriving on campus with little knowledge of what to expect. Yet::: through the challenges faced over the years on this campus::: with the support of your fellow Aggies::: you succeeded.
• And the message that I have taken home is: “Remember who we are”
• Why is this message so important?
• Because too often in universities today::: we are caught up in the game of competition.
• We focus on rankings::: trendy programs::: recruiting the elusive “best” student without taking the crucial step of evaluating whether our initiatives are in sync with who we are.
• In doing so::: we risk losing that which makes us unique::: our collective Aggie spirit.
• One of the most moving events in my time as dean was a special graduation ceremony.
• In March of 2016::: we were contacted with an urgent request from Nick Brewer.
• Sadly::: Nick’s father::: Jim Brewer::: a Texas A&M 1980 civil engineering graduate was ill with pancreatic cancer.
• Jim’s daughter::: Jenny::: was scheduled to graduate in May with an aerospace engineering degree.
• Jim told Nick that one of his last wishes was to see Jenny graduate from Texas A&M Engineering.
• Jim was not doing well in mid-March. The doctors told the family that the end was near.
• Nick asked if we could hold a special graduation ceremony for Jenny.
• One week later::: with help from the university and the association::: Jim witnessed Jenny’s graduation from Texas A&M with full regalia and ceremony at his home.
• Jim lost his battle with cancer two weeks later.
• As we were preparing for the ceremony::: there were no arguments about process::: proper approvals::: or transcripts.
• We made it happen.
• We remembered who we are.
• The past six years have been a period of significant academic change.
• But::: before any new program was implemented::: we first evaluated whether it aligned with our core values. This meant at times we did not follow the same path as other universities.
• We have forged a new path.
• For example:
o To insure there is access to an Aggie engineering degree::: we increased our entering class size and retention::: and also developed a community college transitional program.
o To insure that our students are prepared for life outside of the university::: we hired 75 professors of practice with many years of industry experience.
o And to insure our students experience the world outside of the classroom::: we require all of our students to complete a non-credit extracurricular
project.
• All of these changes are unique to Texas A&M.
• When asked by my peers about the risk of not following the path of other top universities::: I reply: Aggies are not followers::: we lead.
• We have a history of service.
• We stand up when others fall back.
• We provide an excellent education and opportunity to those who seek it.
• And we continue to face new challenges.
• Most of the jobs our students will be taking in 2030 haven’t been invented yet. How do you prepare a student for a job that doesn’t even exist?
• How do we focus on deep learning without stifling creativity?
• How do we select students with high potential from both urban and rural areas::: who possess preparation::: talent and grit::: yet will embrace our core values?
• How do we remain custodians of the past while serving as creators of the future?
• These solutions will be complicated and will require all of us to find the proper balance.
• But I promise you: o As we move into the future::: with all of the unknowns in our changing and dynamic world.
• As we face the challenges of educating a new generation of students with different life experiences and learning styles:::
• And as we consider how to best serve our state and the nation.
• We will always remember who we are. We are Texas A&M.","Congratulations

The Texas A&M University System Board of Regents has named Kathy Banks sole finalist for Texas A&M President: tx.ag/SoleFinalist,2021-03-03 17:05:00,I hope she upholds Aggie traditions and the undying Aggie spirit better than the last Pres. Here’s to giving her a chance!,I have nothing against Dr. Banks. But why not try hiring Aggies for this position??,"What a difference 50 years can make. President Rudder would be proud. Let’s give the lady our support. She’s done an excellent job for the university. I believe this is a great decision. Congratulations
.","Congratulations
::: Dr. Banks! Great to have an engineer as president.",Amazing what being buddies with Sharp will get you. She acts like she doesn't care for the staff in engineering::: so I really hope that changes when she steps into this new role.,"Here is a link to Dr. Banks’ thoughts regarding our Alma Mater...
Last bullet point speaks volumes.

"Pass it back::: Ags! Texas A&M is matching all donations up to $15:::000 to support the Maroon & Orange Texas Tough fundraiser.

Show the strength of the Aggie Family and give to support students affected by last month’s winter storms through March 10: tx.ag/TexasTough
Students can apply for emergency aid here: tx.ag/EmergencyAid",2021-03-03 08:30:00,Going on UT’s site::: they have raised approx $79:::935 by 834 supporters. A&M has a long way to catch up I’d say based on what I am seeing. Good luck!!!!,Great::: now can we go back to having a football rivalry game? We can also find ways to monetize that for charity.,Can we not 🚫 be involved with the whorns?,This is very nice,Awesome,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Current rules and protocols at Texas A&M regarding face coverings will remain in place until March 10::: before which the university will issue further guidance related to Executive Order GA-34 announced today by Governor Abbott.,2021-03-02 18:26:00,Please follow the science and keep the mask mandate in place to protect faculty and staff::: the community::: students::: and students’ families back home!,Please remember the BCS community is bigger than the students. It hurts nothing to keep masks around through the end of the semester. The volunteers at the Brazos hub are working wonders::: but they need more time.,Please keep the mask mandate for the safety of the students::: their families and our communities,As a parent::: I hope you keep the mask mandate until vaccines have been given to all who want them. We haven’t reached herd immunity yet! This virus is still mutating in dangerous ways.,Each to their own. Personally I Support no masks 100%. Looking forward to students returning to class and continuing their education academically as well as socially.,Texas Governor and Senator might be living in some lala land...Ignore them ...You guys please continue with the mask mandate until Vaccinations have reached at least 75%...Save the kids and their parents..Save College Station,Several universities in Texas are continuing to enforce mask mandates and policies that protect their faculty::: staff::: and students by following CDC guidelines. Many also have plans to provide faculty::: students::: and staff access to the vaccine so they can open up safely. Wearing a mask may not be ideal::: but neither is attending the funeral of your friends::: family::: roomies::: and professors.,Sure::: remove a mask mandate for students. While you're at it::: you might as well cancel all science-based classes too. Let's see what's left. For smiles of course!,Please keep the mask mandate this semester. Follow the science and protect the students::: staff and community.,Face mask should be mandated still until every Texas has been vaccinated. If people are tired of wearing face masks and shut downs::: just wait::: we’ll be right back to conditions worse than where we are now. Need to leave politics out of it and listen to the science.,I hope that A & M will actually care about the lives of their students & staff & KEEP THEIR MASK MANDATE,I am sure the university cares more about its students then the governor cares about the citizens of Texas and will keep the mask mandate.,"Only 11.6% of the state have received one or more doses of the #Covid vaccine::: and if the mask and social distancing mandates are lifted::: especially with the 2020 Graduation Make Up Ceremonies being held March 11-13::: many lives would be placed at risk. Wear your mask::: keep your distance::: and stay safe Ags! #classof2020grad
uate",Glad to see the university still values public health and safety. Thank you,PLEASE do not change the mask policy. If not for your students and teachers then for the 2020 graduates who are finally getting a safe graduation after almost a year!!,"Governor Abbott is fully vaccinated. Texas may be WIDE OPEN and no masks next week but unfortunately vaccines aren't WIDE OPEN for the students and everyone yet.
Please follow science and not politics to protect others until Texas has more immunity! 👍",Free our students now!!! It's is disheartening to see our young Aggies forceably constrained with ineffectual face coverings. Excessive fear is not the Spirit of Aggieland!,Pretty sure that A&M is a public university and therefore falls under authority of governor and legislature. I could be wrong but that means unless one of the stipulations he specifically named then university cannot mandate mask::: however if you feel so inclined by personal choice you may continue to wear your mask.,Please keep the masks to protect my fellow Aggie students and my professors!,Please allow our students to return to campus face to face or please refund money for all of the fees associated with building use. My senior has not had one class in person in a year and a half! Mask or no mask - we need in person instruction! Especially for labs!,"All you whining about immunity and not being ready...

Use common sense...
Stay off the liberal news....
Pull your head out of the sand...

Do your OWN research::: listen to experts::: read peer reviews::: check chemical compositions::: etc.

Here::: this is the former VP of Phizer. The company mass producing your little vaccine.

Listen closely and learn something from an expert::: not a beurocrat or the media.

iKYWQ530",Leave mask mandate in place...be smarter than the Governor!!!,Don’t be weak! Fully open Texas A&M,Open the school up! Let the students make their own decisions if they want to wear a mask or not.,Please allow students to decide for themselves. The students mental health depends on them getting back to normal & being able to interact with each other & have in person classes.,"Please keep the mask mandate in place. Use the recommendations
of our own health services and scientists. We are a top tier research university - apply the knowledge we have gained and expertise we harbor as a collective!!!",You’ve got a week. Hope you make the right decisions. Open Texas,Please don’t make stupid mistakes. And the Governor is recommending stupid mistakes.,I love how the comments are prioritizing mental health over physical health. 500:::000k people dead::: new more deadly variants... but by all means let’s get back to normal 🧐 The pandemic is over when we decide it is 🤦🏾‍♀️,"As a current student... keep
the mask mandate we need it !!",I hope they listen to science and logic and remove the mask mandate. If people want to wear them...wear them. This isn’t stopping those who prefer to stop wearing mask.,It is not over. The virus is not gone. It is up to us now to protect ourselves.,how can the governor do this when people are still dying by the .00001s,"Fact: the virus has a 99.6% survival rate.
Fact: people who socially distance::: sanitize and wear masks still get sick.
Fact: people who want to wear masks can still wear masks.
Fact: cases and deaths are at their lowest
Fact: this is the USA. We are all entitled to our opinions but we are not entitled to shame::: belittle or insult others tho don’t agree with us. It’s called respect::: people. Have some.",As an Aggie ('96)::: I am very disturbed by those folks commenting here about lifting a mask mandate. SCIENCE::: not the GOP::: determines when it will be safe to do so. I expect my alma mater to follow the SCIENCE.,Sooo::: y’all really out here being ignorant on purpose? The whole point of lifting the MANDATE is to allow Texans to make the decision for themselves. That is::: you know::: an American value::: no? My body::: my choice? Or does that no longer apply because it “scares” you? Ridiculous. Wear the damn mask if you want::: but don’t force me to wear one out of your own fear. T’s and G’s 😉,Remove campus restrictions. If you want to wear a mask...do so. If you do not want to wear a mask...you shouldn't have to any longer.,Please listen to scientists and health experts about this. Ignore Gov Abbott and his idiocy,"So many people saying to follow the science and then saying things like ""masking is important for students"" which is directly contrary to the science since the deadliness of this disease is incredibly low for college aged students..",YAHS!! Finally!! Happy to get rid of forced masks!! If you want to wear them::: fine. But don’t force them on everyone. If you are scared and live in fear::: wear them!,Please keep the mask mandate in place this semester. Hopefully the world looks much different soon. 🙏🏻,The masks are not working::: the spread did not slow down due to mask policies.... hence the “double mask” since one isn’t working. The “science” behind the joke of a mask that 99% of people are wearing is literally NOT THERE..... take them off::: they were not helping you in the first place. Let our students go to class & have a REAL TEXAS A&M education/ experience. Enough is enough.,Please keep the masks. The same thing happened last summer when cases decreased. Once we opened again it got a lot worse.,Nothing to discuss open up let the kids enjoy college,All the die hard mask fans sounding more like UT than A&M.,Get Aggies back in the classroom!,A&M ignored the science of Bonfire and students died. I hope they take science based::: compassionate actions in 2021.,You can open classes::: but please keep the masks. They work!,Please wear your mask!! It does help!! I had Covid::: my husband is in day 58 of::: being in the hospital::: because of Covid pneumonia. Please protect Yourselves!! Please. ❤️,No more chin diapers,"If you are advocating personal responsibility:::
then you'll understand when professors commute their classes to fully online::: right?? RIGHT???",Masks off next week. Thanks governor Abbott 👍🏻,The consequences of unmasking are going to immeasurably affect your institution.,Wear the masks. There still is the chance that a person can catch it::: and not know he has it::: and pass it on to somebody vulnerable.,Everyone complaining WEAR A MASK IF YOU WANT.,Thank God there are individuals and businesses that are considerably more intelligent than the Texas governor....,Please keep the mask mandate protect our elders and immune compromised individuals,"Continue the mask mandate until everyone has been vaccinated.
Follow the science.",Nothing like using the entire university as an experimental group. Removing the masks is a no-win situation for the university. Even one reason for another Silver Taps would bring the abilities of the leadership into question.,"If you really care and love the people in your life that you say and think you love::: then PLEASE keep your masks on.
We have NOT all been vaccinated yet and we sure AIN'T out of the pandemic woods!!",Keep. The. Mask. Mandate. Save Lives,Open up A&M. Especially in person classes and labs.,To Aggie Nation: Please folks::: keep those mask on until the virus is gone::: i beg you all to the bone to do this. anyways::: Gig Em Aggies,Catholic schools and many private schools have never implemented mask wearing,As much as I approve the order: Abbott needs to show even better leadership on the PUC and ERCOT...,"Today Texas has the lowest COVID hospitalization
s since October 24th.

The positivity rate is the lowest since October 14th steadily declined for 2 straight months.

We gave a daily record of vaccinations: 229:::490.

In the last week we gave 1:::220:::577 vaccine shots.","It’s about personal responsibility.
Take care of yourself. Be smart. Wear your mask. No biggie.",Finally a good deflection from energy deregulation disaster!,This is a mistake and I hope Aggies make the right decision!,"Yes we can voice our concerns respectfully. Mine is Wow!! While Covid still outhere killing people I will wear a mask to protect me n my neighbor! Takes nothing away from me to wear one n mitigate. We just got taken from safer measures by this political circus!. We could have opened Texas more responsibly with masks n mitigation. What a let down n confusing this will be! Voting regrets for me!
Now we are gonna hv to pray n hope people on humanity and more common sense!! 🙏💞",I think it has to do with telling you what to put on your body::: control. So it’s going to be up to you and of course getting your vote.,Fightn Texas Aggie common sense!! Mask up::: for a little longer fellow aggies.,Masks mandate should stay....,Grandson Will is at A & M ::: so hope they are careful!,"👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽.
Open it up if folks want to wear a mask then fine::: that’s their choice Abbott finally did something to free Texans from government and allows us to make our own choices. Don’t be all up in someone’s personal space but most real Texans understand that. Let’s get back to common sense self preservation!",A&M students are adults and should govern themselves accordingly regardless of what Abbott or anyone else says. Calm down::: wear a mask and get a vaccine when it becomes available to you. That’s it. Nothing new.,The number of people in this thread that have let this steer and control their lives is disturbing. Y’all must watch the evening news.,"For all you “follow the science” mask lovers::: exactly how many Aggie students have died from covid? How many have been hospitalized?

ZERO",Threw them away today . Will not be wearing a mask . You want to wear one that is your right.,Then why are there people at the baseball game not eating or drinking and also not wearing mask? You're not really enforcing it anyways.,They need to let them go back to school. Especially sciences classes are very difficult online. Keep the mask and let them go back to school!,I say keep wearing them there is so many college students in there also close all the time,Get on with it. UT will have their students wearing masks for ever.,Concerned for all visual learners::: when professors never(not even once) show themselves on zoom. This does not seem quite right.,What are they gonna do about it ??? Prosecute ????,Stop with public facemasks. Stop testing HEALTHY people for SARS-CoV-2. Real normal is way overdue.,"Keep the masks until majority are vaccinated.
Who gives up on a marathon after 23 miles? Abbot apparently.","Probably <5% of the TAMU population is vaccinated currently (likely <2% given the population in question). Furthermore::: Texas is the 3rd worst state in the US in terms of percentage of population vaccinated. I trust that TAMU will make the right decision and that idiots will sue them because of their ""rights""",just a reminder: texas independence day was march 2nd.,Why would they their chancellor in 1880s was ex Confederate racist officer from West Texas S.Ross. they think Texas is a country!!!,Better start consulting those high dollar attorneys,Please follow CDC guidelines and not Abbott.,Let’s not give them a reason for another Aggie joke.,Please keep the mask mandate!,Please free the kids and let them enjoy the college experience.,Somebody has some sense! Go Aggies!!,No more masks! Let’s get back to face to face classes. The kids need this! Too many suffering from depression and suicide. Those that want to wear masks::: by all means keep them on.,No more masks!!! Freedom😀,"Keep ur mask on!!!!
Our future is in ur hands",RESCIND IT::: AGGIES!,Free tours of the Governor’s Mansion restart when??,Keep the masks!!!,Let’s try 100% in person classes before lifting a mask requirement.,Just pitiful mask don’t work and you know it,I'm honestly not proud I went here anymore.,Just in time for the 2020 makeup graduation. smh,Keep with science ATM::: please!,Masks please,love all the scientist with their youtube and qnon phDs telling ppl what to do... Be SAFE Aggies,Come on Ags...keep the masks in place! We are an institution of higher education - science being a huge part of that. Follow science and the doctors::: nurses::: and scientists that we are raising up in our beloved A&M. Keep the masks! 👍🏻❤️😷,Please keep the mask mandate for the safety of everyone!,So does this mean that Kyle Field can be filled up?,I had covid it’s nothing but a common cold don’t be fooled. Everyone who died had a was gonna die anyways. Covid aint anything,"My goodness::: can we just friggin’ say that if you want to wear a mask::: then wear a mask. But if you don’t::: then don’t! They can’t control what anyone does on their own time in their own homes or hometowns::: so trying to “protect” everyone really does absolutely nothing! I::: for one::: never stopped working and never put on one of those stupid bacteria traps since day 1... I’ve never been sick and have been around plenty of people before and/or after they “had” the China Virus without a mask. My kids split time between our house and their mom’s 50/50::: they go to school::: our youngest goes to daycare::: and our oldest goes to college. We do not wear masks unless required by a business and we don’t have an option to go elsewhere. And no one in our house has been sick::: not even a little bit! Why? Because we didn’t suppress our immune system! Follow the science and you will see that annual deaths in 2020 were BELOW or very close to the national average of the years prior...

"In the past::: Texas has been touted as the ""energy capital of the country:::"" however::: the state's power grid was no match for this past week's unprecedented winter weather::: leaving millions of Texans without heat.  In this Houston Chronicle article::: a trio of Texas A&M Engineering professors break down what exactly happened::: and offer several actionable::: strategic steps to build a better grid for Texas: tx.ag/TexasPowerFailure  HOUSTONCHRONICLE.COM Opinion: What went wrong with Texas's power failure and how to fix it",2021-02-21 00:16:04,You can also read the full article at Texas A&M Today here: tx.ag/ TexasPower,Cannot read the article if you don't have a subscription. 😪,“Unprecedented winter storms and frigid temperatures hit across the state beginning on Sunday::: causing more than 30 gigawatts of generation capacity to be taken off-line.” - The question is why and what was taken off line. They just kinda blast through that one.,Cant read the article::: it’s behind a pay wall; so I’ll just say relying on wind and solar power to save us all in the dead of winter isn’t a big brain idea either,Would love a different link. Sends me straight to a paywall even though I rarely::: if ever::: read Houston Chronicle articles.,Tony Romo discussing Tom Brady’s and Patrick Mahomes’ performance in the Super Bowl is still armchair quarterbacking. Sure::: these guys are smart and PhDs but::: as an ELEN ‘91 whose done plenty of reliability and project management work in the energy industry::: I’d wait until the entire investigation is complete before I’d make any recommendations . There may be some solutions that are no or low cost and easier to implement.,Take a lesson from us Texans out in nowhere land pf El Paso. Our power never went out. Our system was upgraded after 2011 due to a similar unprecedented cold -2 degrees which devastated El Paso. Changes were made which helped us through this last week. Lesson learned Even from us put here in no where land.,I am disappointed that Texas A&M which was renowned in the world for Power System Reliability engineering could not overcome the political calculus. Politics -1. Science- 0.,I’m thinking solar panel lit roadways that also integrate WiFi electricity::: phone lines::: and water/sewer lines::: all within the road. There has to be better ways to deal with icy roads::: maybe change the roads themselves 🤷🏻‍♂️ #GigEm,What is missing is a good mechanical engineering professor who has worked in the power industry.,Leave it to the great engineers of Texas A and M!!😊,I read the article::: and while it has good suggestions::: it is incomplete and misleading. More connections with surrounding states would not have persuaded surrounding states to send us electricity they desperately needed themselves. While winterizing the wind turbines would have helped and will help in the future::: wind is not a dependable source of electricity. Much more important is to ensure that every plant::: renewable or otherwise::: committed to providing electricity is capable of providing electricity under a more expanded range of temperatures. Forcing them to upgrade will be the key limiting step. We need political will to either proportionally penalize the plants for failure in the future or fund the upgrades with state money. ERCOT needs to take a more active role in ensuring readiness::: and it may take new powers from new state laws. One thing that will not help is personal attacks::: on politicians or ERCOT boardmembers.,the key word is unprecedented. when the power grid was being built::: maintained::: updated::: no one dreamed we would have an entire week of winter weather::: no one dreamed we would have 105 hours of below freezing temperatures::: and no one dreamed we would have snow storms::: let alone multiple events::: or snow that would stay on the ground for days.,Reality check this is a once in a decade if not more storm. Preparing for stuff like its going to happen all the time is a waste of time and money. Most casualties were road accidents and people who are uneducated and got carbon monoxide poisoning. The vast majority of deaths were not people dying from exposure like its Minnesota.,"Disappointing article - it lacks depth and includes little discussion::: particularly the two line ""paragraph"" on infrastructure which only seems to throw wind under the bus. My understanding is that on the first weekend of the cold snap::: wind was actually overproducing. So::: how long did they keep providing power? How many actually went down? How many of this number are usual for this time of year? We can do better Ags!",Here's some reality for you - I'm on Entergy's power grid out of Louisiana::: not on the Texas power grid::: and my power was out for a longer period of time on the first day than some of my friends in Houston. Texas's power grid wasn't the problem - an unprecedented mass of cold air coming donw from Canada that effected all power operators in the region::: not just the ones in Texas::: was the problem.,Yes::: it was a so called once in a lifetime experience. Let the professionals solve the problem::: not the politics both local and in Austin. There will be ::: it has already started from the local and state level::: get their name in the newspaper::: be seen on T.V. They want to start the blame game.,I’d be interested in the article::: but it’s behind a paywall.,Probably firt time I looked at houston chronicle this year. It goes strait to subscription.,Winterize. Insulated pipes even inside walls. Propane heat can save lives freeze ups and no electricity required. Solar panels soon at my place.,You shouldn't need a subscription to read unless you have already read multiple other articles this month and maxed out your free ones for the month.,Shut down of clean::: coal burning plants::: restrictions on gas production::: shutdown of pipelines::: poor think-ahead planning::: stupid out of state ERCOT people and idiotic green energy!!!!,I'm very dissapointed in this report. You left out many key factors on why this happened.,That was one really USELESS article. My oldest is graduating from Aggieland this spring::: and my youngest is headed there to study engineering in the fall. Is that ALL YA GOT????,It was not unprecedented. None of the major cities set all time records. It gets below zero in Dallas once every 25 years on average. This is not unprecedented.,I also heard that Feds refused to allow us to access all of our power. Seems like a bunch of posturing::: excuses::: finger pointing::: not wanting to admit... What Texans mainly want...fix it and we know we don't have to rely on anyone else if we keep Texas and Texans first.,There is a much better article on this topic by Texas Monthly magazine. It’s based on facts::: not political opinions.,Texas certainly needs more nuclear power plants. Probably down near lesser cities like Corpus or Galveston.,Only one thing needed. Wide adoption of nuclear power!,Get the Aggie’s on it! It will be running like a well oiled machine!,The piece left out the part that renewable energy is too expensive::: inconsistent and is not built to last. Tell me more about fossil fuels. That’s where we need to be.,Power Grids have been surviving ice storms for decades. Come on Texas::: it’s time to step up.,Simple - we are not built for that kind of once-in-a-hundr ed-year event. In our area::: the previous record for under freezing was 40 hours. Think about that!!,Texas' energy grid should be managed and superintended by TEXANS!,Government & special interests (climate change) are no. 1 reasons why power grids are inadequate and construction is being delayed.,Texas let people who don’t live here run ercot,It's a lesson learned for not being connected to the other power grids in America. If Texas was connected it could have at least taken power temporarily from other states to get through this,And it should be paid for by using the money they spend on STAAR for it!!!,Uncapping the market price for when electricity is not available is the only potential fix for the marketplace concept. Or having true competition between grids if that is possible.  But consumers buying electricity at spot market prices is clearly a terrible idea...,The grid could handle it::: bad choices by humans caused the issue.,Frozen wind turbines ! New Green Deal . Saving the planet one broken/downed system at a time .,Put the coal powered plants back to work !,If we would have stuck with natural gas::: Oil::: coal! We would be just fine!,"What they failed to tell you is that almost all or the 20 GW that fell off the grid on Sunday was wind turbines. According to the Wall Street Journal::: ""Between 12 a.m. on Feb. 8 and Feb. 16::: wind power plunged 93% while coal increased 47% and gas 450%::: according to the [Energy Information Administration] EIA."" Gas fell of on Monday as more gas was diverted for heat and because plants were not winterized and coal and gas began to fail. Plus they did not even mention the clean::: safe::: and dependable power source that is nuclear. (Class of '79::: Gig 'em)",Really this is texas the weather can flip in an instant and flip hard. Total mismanagement by some out of state hacks,For all the titles the authors hold::: this article is a thin cup of tea. And where is nuclear power in the list of solutions?,It looks to me that the “system” is not a system. It’s rather a business where the main objective is “profit” instead of reliability.,What went wrong is politics!,How to fix it? Turn Texas Blue.,Opinion article from a notable “engineering” school?

Paste into a different browser.,A viewpoint from academics; however::: I see nothing of how Texas followed federal guidelines to replace reliable coal::: oil::: and gas dictates for more green energy over the last 20-25 years. Going to green without sensible and practicable backups for a relatively still nascent technology is also a contributing factor.  As someone who has spent the last 43 years both as an academic (7 years) and practical application where the rubber meets the road (36+ years)::: this is one viewpoint for us to consider in a host of possible solutions in order to find near-::: mid-::: and long term optimal solutions.  Gig’em 78👍🏻,Posted from a friend regarding ERCOT and how it all happened. We can thank the Biden administration. Unbelievable.  An Emergency Order from the Biden administration’ s Department of Energy shows Texas energy grid operator ERCOT was instructed to stay within green energy standards by purchasing energy from outside the state at a higher cost::: throttling power output throughout the state ahead of a catastrophic polar vortex.  Going into effect Sunday::: Feb. 14::: Emergency Order 202-21-1 shows the Energy Dept. was aware of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s statewide disaster declaration and that ERCOT was readying gas utilities in preparation for a demand surge.  The order shows Acting Energy Secretary David Huizenga did not waive environmental restrictions to allow for maximum energy output::: instead ordering ERCOT to utilize all resources in order to stay within acceptable emissions standards – including purchasing energy from outside the state.  “ERCOT anticipates that this Order may result in exceedance of emissions of sulfur dioxide::: nitrogen oxide::: mercury::: and carbon monoxide emissions::: as well as wastewater release limits:::” the order states. “To minimize adverse environmental impacts::: this Order limits operation of dispatched units to the times and within the parameters determined by ERCOT for reliability purposes.”  Moreover::: the order instructed an “incremental amount of restricted capacity” to be sold to ERCOT at “a price no lower than $1:::500/MWh:::” an increase of over 6:::000 percent over February 2020 prices of $18.20.  On Wednesday::: the Dallas Business Journal reported::: “Electricity on the Texas grid has averaged about $1:::137.33 per megawatt hour so far in February::: up from $18.20 per megawatt hour in February 2020::: according to data from the Electricity Reliability Council of Texas. That’s a jump of more than 6:::000 percent.”  Days later::: the Public Utility Commission of Texas set prices at $9:::000/MWh.  The EO shows the Biden administration basically ordered ERCOT to throttle its energy output by forcing it to comply with environmental green energy standards::: while knowing full well Texans could freeze to death in their homes with zero electricity as temperatures plunged into the single digits.,HERE IS THE OPINION ARTICLE - For those who say they can’t get it w/o a subscription——-  Millions of Texans have experienced power outages at a time when electricity seems to be most needed::: during the worst winter storm in decades.The Electric Reliability Council of Texas and utility engineers around the state are working around the clock to fix the problem::: but it still remains to be seen when power will be restored to all customers. Texas::: the energy capital of the country::: does not seem to be able to supply the power needed in severe weather.  Here we would like to present our perspectives in simple non-technical terms on what happened::: why did it happen and what could be done to prevent it from happening again. Our goal is to stimulate conversations among citizens::: utilities::: system operators::: regulatory bodies and academia so that this experience will serve as a wake-up call to address the criticality of our energy infrastructure as we make progress toward a more resilient and sustainable future.  What happened?  Unprecedented winter storms and frigid temperatures hit across the state beginning on Sunday::: causing more than 30 gigawatts of generation capacity to be taken off-line. On the demand side::: due to this cold weather::: the electric load hit a record of more than 69GW on that night. In response to this combination of historically high demand and unprecedented shortage of power supply::: ERCOT initiated “Energy Emergency Alert 3” which ordered transmission companies to begin rotating outages across the state. Meanwhile::: skyrocketing demand for natural gas to heat homes in the frigid conditions meant the already stretched supply of gas available for electricity generation was even further compromised. Why did this happen in Texas::: often touted as the energy capital of the country (if not the world)? While final answers await a comprehensive investigation::: several key factors may have contributed to this historic power outage.  First::: unlike the interconnected regional grids that serve most of the rest of the country::: Texas’s ERCOT grid essentially stands on its own. This limits power import and export during extreme situations. When states like Minnesota or California have extreme weather conditions::: they can draw upon inter-state power transmission lines to get power from the interconnection . The Texas grid is largely an isolated grid from the eastern and western interconnection s that serve the rest of the country.  Second::: the massive natural gas and wind generation infrastructure in Texas is not ready for such a winter storm. Many turbines were shut down due to the freezing weather. Equipping these wind turbines with anti-freezing technologies is doable::: but will require additional investments. Third::: so called “demand response:::” the synchronization mechanism of demand and supply::: which is a smart grid technology to extract flexibility at the customer end::: is still in a nascent stage here. Other than urging customers to practice voluntary energy conservation::: currently there are very few organized technology and business mechanisms to enable load-serving entities to reduce demand at peak periods to manageable levels. This could be automatically done at the customer end by prioritizing essential services such as lighting over non-essential services such as laundry.  How it can be fixed  While our state is still in the midst of this immediate crisis::: we would like to offer a few strategic::: actionable items for the state and for Texans. Resiliency will need to be on top of every decision maker’s mind. In particular::: to better prepare the Texas grid for future extreme events::: we recommend the following actions. * We need to winterize wind turbines and other generating infrastructure for extreme conditions.  * We should invest in additional High Voltage DC lines to connect ERCOT with both Eastern and Western interconnection s::: so that we can draw upon imports/ exports when the supply of electricity becomes more volatile.  * We need the regulatory and market design to scale up implementation of demand response. The necessary technologies::: including smart meters on most of our houses::: are already there. What is missing is the proper market mechanics::: such as proper crediting of demand contribution::: and the political will to promote wide adoption.  * Last but not least::: just as we have developed strategic oil reserves::: it is high time to think about strategic energy storage reserves. Electric energy storage would go a long way during this time to minimize hardship for millions of Texans. Much research and innovation will be needed to fully develop the potential of energy storage at grid scale.  While it is cold comfort in the middle of a crisis::: what we are experiencing now are the growing pains of the transition to new technologies and new energy resources. However::: with actions such as those above::: we will be better prepared for whatever Nature may throw at us in the future.,Your asking us to winterize these turbines. And then join the rest of the states international grid. STOP- I didn't need to go any further. Texas experienced a rare winter. This is not the first bad winter. It is the first bad winter not having our clean coal energy plants up and running. We let international grid users tell us how best to go GREEN and plant these syfi looking wind mills on good farm land::: and solar panels to prove that there was a better way! Well you Green folks failed. These international grid folks have been having trouble for years years!! We do not need them to put burden on Texas energy because the fail to plan! We messed up listening to how we can do better from states that can't balance a check book. No::: we need our coal plants back up and going full time and sell these turbines::: that use fuel back to California. From my kitchen window I see the red glowing lights at night. When we go to Mexia we see these hundreds of hundreds weird out of place things. They don't turn like a windmill. They barely move. Not just ours but the ones in New Mexico never saw them move. Now that is not efficient nor sufficient technology for Texas. We need the coal from up north for our power plants. It is the best grade for use. See the power plant is in view from !y house as well. And it is running on natural gas so it won't be completely shut down. It takes a lot to load those big boys up. So y'all finaggling numbers and talk of how we need to join others on their grid sounds more like a door to door vacuum sales men wanting to prove that he has a better deal and at the end to prove how good it is they dump what they already had in the filter on your floor. No thanks. So y'all shut down our clean coal plants we had built to replace the other coal plants. Then you shut down power plants and plant turbines and solar panels. Now you want use to winterize a bad investment. And then join other states that already have blackouts. No. We were doing good before these GREENFOLKS started running Washington. You always want to show us how to improve on what others have failed at. This is the south. We are determined and sometimes rugged people. My husband is a Diesel director at a Texas collage. The have been on there edge of new technology for 15 years. So I hear the conversations and I watch the solutions from the north. But the north have no idea how we have run this state. They don't like crude. We love crude. They hate the pipeline. You know what they hate::: is when their ideas fail and they can't hover over us. I vote a big Texas NO! Get that mess out of here and let us Texans run our state.,Paywalls suck::: here's the article text:  Millions of Texans have experienced power outages at a time when electricity seems to be most needed::: during the worst winter storm in decades.

"Over the past week::: Aggies have quietly demonstrated acts of selfless service in response to the winter weather.  Last night::: more than 300 members of the Texas A&M Corps of Cadets volunteered to help identify burst pipes across campus. They thoroughly canvassed 200 buildings on campus::: finding many leaks. Their efforts helped stabilize water issues at a time when many SSC at TAMU employees could not drive to campus.  Cadets have also been aiding the local chapter of the American Red Cross Serving Central and South Texas and the Brazos Valley Food Bank at the Reed Arena warming center & in the community.  Additionally::: Staci Rende '19 has helped coordinate ""Aggieland Relief:::"" a drive asking the public to donate blankets::: jackets::: coats::: socks::: gloves::: bottled water::: non-perishable food::: camping gear::: clothes::: and towels. The drive will be set up from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Friday in the Reed Arena parking lot next to West Campus Garage.  Read more about these acts of selfless service and how you can donate to Aggieland Relief here: tx.ag/AggieResponse",2021-02-19 02:32:51,Whoop!

Whoop!,One more reason Texas A&M is a special place. Service to others is an action::: not a platitude.,That's what is all about in Aggieland. So Proud of these young adults.,Reminds me of the corp stepping up and outfitting reed arena as a shelter during Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Doesn't surprise me one bit that they stepped up again. Thanks and Gig Em!,This is how Aggies have responded all over the world for generations 👍🏻,So proud of the Corp of Cadets and their assistance during this extreme weather event!,Thank you A&M Corps of Cadets.,This is awesome. But Texas A&M University Galveston Campus could also use A LOT of help. Many students aren’t able to drive back home (international or not safe to drive). I was lucky to come back home today after days without power or running water. The staff at Galveston is doing everything they can but a helping hand from main campus would be great. Thanks and gig em,Because that is what Aggies do! Thank you cadets👍,Thank you to our wonderful corps of cadets.,Thank you Aggies! Thank you Cadets!!! Compassion and selflessness goes a long way!!!,That's Good Bull right there. Great job Ags. Glad to see this generation is willing to pull up their sleaves.,WHOOP!!!!!

What do I say? Hell it is already broke::: all I can do is break it more or maybe::: just maybe fix it.,what about the dogs in danger freezing too please help them too .,maybe they should take over for the governor. They do a better job,Texans showing the rest of us how to do it. No protesting::: no cancel culture censorship::: just help and support to all.,This why my two boys will be Aggies.,Don't forget to check on students from warmer climates. Back several decades ago::: I met a young woman from Botswana shivering at one of the on campus bus stops. We visited and I learned where she was from and how she had left her children and husband to study at A&M to enable her and her family to better help their country. When I figured out she had not forgotten her coat.....she didn't have one. I took mine off and gave it to her. She was too cold to refuse::: and i was on my way home. From then on I kept an eye out for students unprepared for the unusually cold Texas weather. This winter is so much worse::: and complicated. Love ya::: Aggies!,I am so proud to be an Aggie when I hear stories like this! 👍,Thank you AGGIES! Your truly a blessing.

Join us in saying “Howdy!” to our new mascot candidate::: the soon-to-be Reveille X!  The 18-month-old collie will spend the next few months shadowing Reveille IX as she trains to become the First Lady of Aggieland and represent Texas A&M::: the Texas A&M Corps of Cadets::: and Aggies everywhere. After spending six years as our beloved mascot::: Reveille IX will retire at the end of the spring semester. tx.ag/RevCandidate,2021-02-05 17:41:45,Another Rough Collie?::: give me a break. Rescue a Pit Bull with bite scars for once.  Sure you'll piss off a bunch of old Ags::: but they have been angry since the 90's. There is no fixing that.,I love Collies::: my first dog was one. The aggies are OK too!,Here’s to Reveille IX. “Damn Good Dawg” as we say of our Uga’s! She visited us in Georgia! What a beautiful dog and mascot. I look forward to seeing Reveille X in Athens in the future. Uga will look forward to meeting her! Best wishes and Happy Retirement!,I´m outraged that Cannoli::: a HEALTHY DOG in @TAMU´s muscular dystrophy lab::: was put up for adoption & then yanked back into another lab. He´s NOT a test tube. Shut down the dog lab! #FrreCannoliDogT AMU @AggieNetwok @TAMUVetMed @TAMUSystem @TXAMFoundation @Shane_Hinckley @12thMan,Beautiful & well taken care of during her reign. Where will she live after retirement? Do alumni sometimes take her?,Meanwhile lots of highly adoptable dogs sit in shelters right here in B/CS. I really wish the school would adopt a mutt like the first Reveille instead of from breeders like Reveille IX's that shave their vocal chords so the poor dog can't even bark.,She is lovely but wasn't the original Reveille a Boarder Collie? Why did they change to Collie?,Beautiful girl. Do you only keep the mascots for so long? Just wondering why the other Revellie is retiring so soon.,Is this one going to be kennel raised and bark less also? Cause that sounds like a perfect candidate and reputable breeder for sure 👍,Howdy! For all those current students::: I hope she barks a lot! :),Release the dogs you hold in confinement for revolting and useless testing. Enable the remaining dogs to be released to a loving home. These poor dogs are suffering under your so-called care.,what about the dogs you have in the lab they are beautiful too why don't you have a picture of them to?shame on you go get them out now.please rescuse them and let them go.,Beautiful::: but please stop your experimenting on other just as beautiful dogs. It’s cruel and unnecessary.,She looks like she will be a handful. I remember one of the Reveille's was a barker. You were supposed to get a out of class if Reveille barked but that never happened.,She is gorgeous! Where does Reveille IX retire to? I would love to adopt her! Me and my husband are Class of ‘93! 💕💕 I’m sure she has a home already but thought we would ask! 👍🏽,She’s beautiful! I hope her vocal chords aren’t cut though 😞,My favorite breed::: such a beautiful dog.💕💕 reminds me of my Shane.,What happens to the retired Reveille?,She's beautiful.

Howdy Rev X!,Reveille x is a beautiful dog indeed. But what about Cannoli and all the other dogs you are experimenting on in your laboratories. They are beautiful too and can feel pain and loneliness just like any other animal. There is no difference between them and your mascot. They deserve loving homes too. It is downright unjust to keep them in torment.,Please allow the dogs you have locked up to be adopted. Enough cruelty to innocent dogs.,She is beautiful and has a spark in her eyes!! And such a happy face! Look forward to her journey as Reveille X!,Love the Collies; Love the tradition of Reveille!!,And yet you torture dogs in the lab. Cognitive dissonance? Free cannoli and the other dogs in the lab. You offered him up for adoption but then shipped him to another lab. He deserves a chance to be surrounded by people who love him and will not torture him. https:// youtu.be/ zFE0NvVk6l4,Howdy beautiful!

Join us in celebrating the leadership::: impact::: and excellence displayed by Black Aggies and their contributions to Texas A&M.  Read more about Black history at Texas A&M: tx.ag/BHM21,2021-02-02 01:13:23,HAPPY BLACK HISTORY MONTH!! ✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿,Can someone help me understand something....is this the official TAMU fb and if so::: are these posts moderated? The undercurrent of racism on campus and I'm BCS is real and very troubling. As an alum::: I would have serious pause in supporting my children being subjected to that environment. TAMU can do more in my opinion starting by moderating their comments. And if I hear all lives matter or all aggies matter or I don't see color one more time. Educate yourselves. Good Lord.,"Love it! Showcase these accomplishments proudly! These advancements are beneficial for our community and Aggie family. About 10 years after slaves were freed::: A&M was founded. Only 100 years later did A&M have their first black student. A lot of firsts for A&M happened from then on are truly awesome. The question isn't whether we should or shouldn't celebrate black history::: but why is black history a hard pill to swallow? Y'all need to see that BHM isn't suppressing accomplishments of other races::: when black accomplishments have been oppressed on a farce of ""racism"". Take a moment to look through the damn article.  Thanks and GIG 'EM.",Reading these racist comments (that aren’t being deleted) is just another reason why I won’t be donating to my Alma mater. Happy Black History Month! Black Lives Matter!,Stop segregating and embrace all student accomplishments .,"We are the Aggies::: the Aggies are we. I celebrate the accomplishments of ALL Aggies but I do not feel they need to be categorized by race. I would be shocked to see a headline read ""check out what these White Aggies have done"" 😶",For those wondering why we celebrate black history month - 99% of Western history is written from a white perspective. Journals::: books::: newspaper entries::: personal diaries::: even our own history books we read... all written from a white person or white perspective. Black perspectives were ERASED from the narrative of Western development pretty much all the way up till super-recently( think::: less than 100 years...). Black history month is meant to highlight the achievement of black people DESPITE the oppression and silence of their voices for the past centuries. White people have never really had silenced voices or oppression::: so their creativity::: resources::: and capabilities were unbound. Of course it's all written from a white perspective. Let's just sit back and enjoy learning about all the amazing things black people have brought to your life and society - i'm sure the books never told you anyway.,Well you also need Hispanic month::: Japanese month::: Chinese month::: Brazilian month! I could go on and on! However::: we can’t have Caucasian month because we are too privileged.,once again::: the vile racists spewing forth their vitriol and hatred all over these comments,Will you be having a history month for any other race::: ethnicity? If not::: this is exactly what still keeps America so Divided!,Thanks for sharing this::: Judy.,When Czech History Month ????,Growing up in Texas and attending TAMU in the 70s::: I learned precious little about black history. Black history month has taught me much. I am a better person for it.,Tier 1 . Honorable. Taking care of your past::: present::: future. Leadership.  Thanks TAMU! Education happens by doing💪❤️👍,Thank you Black Aggies! 🙌,Asians and Hispanics need more recognition.,Morgan Freeman on black history month ⬇️  https:// www.facebook.com / steven.carroll.5 648/videos/ 1304902013230407 /?d=n,Dang. Whoever’s taking care of Old Army needs to make sure they’re taking their meds. They’re getting awful uppity in these A&M comment sections the last few weeks.,You mean it's still okay to celebrate history??? I thought society had it all canceled...,Man you guys are funny!!!,When is Aggieland celebrating Caucasian month? Asking for a friend.,👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾,Wow💗,If you are going to celebrate black history month. Then remember it all Just like they remember white history..and it doesn't where I'm from. You bunch of RACIST.,Talk about racism. Embarassing TAMU!!

Ten years ago::: the Texas A&M Women’s Basketball team became national champions and brought the NCAA Women's Basketball trophy home to Aggieland! Today::: the legendary team reunited and was honored in Reed Arena.  Texas A&M Women’s Basketball January 31::: 2021 at 5:34 PM ·  Our National Champions ❤️,2021-02-01 01:04:52,WHOOP! So sad I missed this event! We had season tickets that awesome season!!,I remember watching that game on TV. It was so exciting! I’m glad we were at yesterday’s game to see the former players.,Right! If you polled 100 Aggie students on campus right now::: 99 of them would not know the women’s basketball team won that championship! Heck I would be surprised if most even knew A&M had a women’s tram. 😆,I saw that NCAA Women's Championship game on TV back in 2011::: and I was screaming and pulling for these lady Ags to win it all! THEY DID!!! Still have their picture in the My Pictures folder! Can't believe that it's been 10 years since they won that trophy! Glad to see that they were honored this weekend at TAMU for their great accomplishments ! Unfortunately::: I can't remember the team that they beat to win that title-\-\Sorry::: my bad! But that was an awesome game! I hope that this year's women's basketball team will make the NCAAs after not being able to play in the 2020 NCAAs thanks to that coronavirus situation. WHOOP!!! GIG EM!!! GO AGGIES!!! Chari 🙂🏀🏆,Watched that game on my laptop in an anatomy test review!

Teens and adults with special needs often have a harder time finding appropriate dental care::: so the College of Dentistry is starting a program to equip dentists with the skills needed to treat special-needs patients::: and also plans to open a specialty clinic to serve Dallas/Fort Worth area.  TODAY.TAMU.EDU Filling A Gap In Special-Needs Dental Care - Texas A&M Today,2021-01-30 00:46:51,This is great::: my sister is special needs and I have to pay for her dental work. Never have understood why dental is not covered by Medicaid. We go to a dentist for special needs but very expensive for them to sedate her.,Whoop!! Way to go! Fortunately my son’s hygienist and dr were willing to hear::: accept::: and embrace the information and suggestions from me. They learned the child and they always loved to see him coming! Talk to moms and dads that can give insight in general not just child specific. A round table of ideas.,WHOOP! This is awesome news! Finding a dentist who understands the needs of our youngest son has been a God-send. No more tears.  Thanks & Gig 'em! 👍,If you aren’t already working with him::: you NEED to get in touch with Dr Dent from Sugar Land Modern Dentistry. Pioneer and THE go-to guy in this area.,Great need for this. Luckily we have a great dentist and anesthesiologis t who works on our 27 yr old autistic daughter.,This would be amazing. My daughter refused to open her mouth for the dentist.

We're an Aggie Family who takes care of one another::: and to do that::: we must respect protocols currently in place on and off campus.  Don’t pass it back::: stay safe::: and BTHO spring 2021! tamu.edu/coronavirus,2021-01-28 01:02:00,A&M::: thank you for having these Covid safety protocols in place to keep our children safe::: healthy::: and in school. My freshman Aggie has a sister on the frontlines. He knows the seriousness of Covid through her experiences. He is happy to be at A&M. Keep the safety protocol in place and keep our kids in school. I’m praying for more face to face classes in the fall of 2021. We all need to do our part to BTHOCovid! Cathy ‘90,Your concern for students is admirable but ironic while Texas A&M has sweet innocent dogs being tormented in cages Why aren't you students speaking out & condemning this hideous situation Dogs feel pain & loneliness Let them be free to be adopted & enjoy the rest of their short lives🐾💔🐕💕,Congratulations Memo on ordering your Aggie Gold!!,My daughter is a freshman and has been tested 3 times so far (twice with random school testing). In these unprecedented times::: I don’t have a problem with it::: and am thankful the University is doing everything possible to try and make a safe experience for our students attending classes (both zoom::: and in person). As a parent::: I’m thankful and appreciative!!,"Incoming ""experts"" who know better than virologists",Take care of those students who feel disenfranchised . To have even ONE suicide on our campus is one too many. Our freshman are struggling. We can do better!!,I use to like this my grandkids graduated from Aggies so proud for them thank God,I’m so sad to see so much hate from part of the Aggie family. Seriously. Do your part to keep students and the community safe. Watch out for one another. Remember::: like Aggies are supposed to do? Gig Em. (Classes of 2010 & 2015::: including a doctorate for which I studied virology) 👍🏻,Wonderful College 👍,Look at all these kids wearing only 1 mask. Don’t they know it’s safer to wear 3 or 4 now?  I wonder if there will be any apology coming from the university for forcing kids to take a covid test with a high percentage rate of false positives and then forcing kids with a phony asymptomatic case into isolation.,prayers for all of our current and Aggie Alum,Aparecida Ribeiro,us Aggies always have each other's backs,Emilia Cano,good,Wow!!!!! Never expected such bowing down from A&M.🐑,\\,Be a leader and stop this nonsense.,🤠🥰,🐑,🙄🙄🙄,Um::: the the purpose of “pass it back” is to let other Aggs know what’s about to go down... So don’t pass it back actually is saying don’t let your brother and sister Aggs know what’s happening... So it should be “Pass it back::: Aggs! BTHO Rona by following current safety precautions! AY::: WHOOP (or whatever Wildcat is appropriate)!!! ”,You’re right . I have always heard how dumb Aggies are and now they go and act intelligent. What’s the world coming to?,As an Aggie ‘00 with a freshman at t.u. I’m so glad that A&M is making it work and at least trying to make college life as normal as possible...mask or no mask. My son in Austin has been living 24-7 in an off campus dorm for 6 months. Hasn’t seen the inside of a class and has barely even walked around campus. That is so much worse for our young adults’mental health than an exposure to Covid. Suicide rates need to be counted against positive cases/deaths with this demographic when weighing solutions (ages 13-24). Just my two cents. Gig’ em Ags! BTHO Covid! Thank goodness I’m an Aggie living in a rural county in the great state of Texas! We have more freedoms than anyone I know at this point! #blessed,My daughter is a Aggie👍Thanks for Doin' it Right 👍GIG'EM,We must take careof safety code.,Doin' it Right 👍Whoop!,Cause the cdc haven't back tracked multiple times....,Hello Chris,Whoop!!,Way to go Aggies,Full body biosuits would be better.,Mask do nothing.

It is long overdue.,Thank you for sharing the plan for inclusivity and diversity. I hope A&M is able to make all students feel at home and for prospective minority students to not feel unwelcome. When everyone has a place at the table::: A&M will be better than ever.,Please don’t follow the cancel culture. A&M stands for tradition. Keep it that way.,Looks like A&M has a very high diversity rating. Why the need to spend $25 million? Where is the money going? Why not just post this fact-check and be done with it?  https:// www.collegefactu al.com/ colleges/ texas-a-and-m-un iversity-colleg e-station/ student-life/ diversity/,Core values also means honoring the past and recognizing significant figures who have made A&M what it is today.

Now let's wait for those that say: ""No! That's different!..... .""",Don’t touch Sully. I am all for adding a statue or bust of Matthew Gaines::: but not if it comes at the cost of another exemplary soldier::: statesman::: knightly gentleman and key figure in A&M and Prairie View A&M’s history.

You’d think people who’d completed degrees beyond middle school would understand history and progress. Shame on those of you who are whining about “traditions” that demean and discriminate against your fellow Texans. The next generation of Aggies will be so much better than the previous ones::: in part because they will share learning space with people who don’t look like them.,History is for everyone::: no person or group has the right to deny others those lessons learned from the past.

TAMUS.EDU Texas A&M System Regents Approve Plans to Improve Diversity - The Texas A&M University System  The Texas A&M University System January 25::: 2021 at 6:03 PM ·  Today::: The Texas A&M University System Board of Regents adopted a series of initiatives to address issues of diversity at Texas A&M University::: including almost $25 million in additional money for scholarships and a greater emphasis on recruiting minority students and faculty.  “What we do best at Texas A&M is to take ordinary kids and turn them into extraordinary citizens. The biggest favor Texas A&M can do for Texas is to be sure there is at least one Aggie ring in every Texas family. That is what this effort is all about.” — Chancellor John Sharp,2021-01-26 00:09:59,How about lowering the tuition::: dorm costs::: meal plan costs::: etc? That would benefit all current students. How about removing race and gender from the application? Best students get in period.,"You can recruit all you want and give scholarships to whomever you want::: but the real thing that will matter is::: will they have the grit and ability to stay once they are there. That should be the only thing that matters for a student candidate. I believe it's a sad time when any University is focused on recruiting anything other than the brightest student that sees the campus/ traditions/ culture as a place they can thrive. If the kid deserves to be at A&M::: I don't care what color::: orientation::: or political affiliation they are::: but I do hope that in A&M's desire to be ""diverse"" that they will accept that so is the mind. Don't engineer our kids in critical race theories and political agenda's that are consuming Universities across the country. My kid shouldn't have to write a paper from the perspective of a liberal mindset in order to get their A. You want diverse - teach your professors to welcome diverse thought.",Why A&M? Why not recruit the best students and faculty? Nothing like affirmative action to unfairly exclude deserving students just to reach quotas.,You are just falling into the trap of the liberal speaking points. It should not be about the color of the skin or their sex but the quality of person and their character. You disappoint me A&M,Why?? How much more diverse can TAMU be? This is a final::: ridiculous “legacy” of Chancellor Sharp. There is so much more for our dear Texas A&M to focus on - like taking the best::: brightest students::: regardless of skin color::: AND at the same time giving financial aid to those who need it. This is ridiculous. It’s social pandering to the woke culture::: and it is NOT what Aggie Alumni are getting behind to support. Three thumbs down here.,I am disgusted with my school. Texas A&M should only be concerned about recruiting the brightest and best. It is time all races of Americans are recruited under the same standards. Until we get rid of preferences we will never see an end to Racism.,Happy day! Which color do we need to be to be considered diverse? Are Asians going to continue to be overlooked and bypassed for other groups? Asking for a friend.,Texas A&M has always been great because it admits students of promise and gives them tools to become great in their own rights. It is the transformationa l process of a quality education that defines the Aggie experience. It is the duty of the state’s land grant institution to offer the opportunity to all::: regardless of color::: ethnicity::: religious affiliation::: socioeconomic status or gender.,Well it's about damn time! Sorry::: I experienced some of the worst racism there. Even though I graduated from there::: I am definitely encouraging my sons to attend somewhere like UC Berkeley or NYU.,This is a really interesting report. One of the reasons why they feel the campus isn’t as diverse as they’d like it to be isn’t because minorities aren’t being accepted::: it’s more about why they aren’t choosing to come to A&M. Read the report! They do a good job of honoring the Aggie Core Values and wanting to open up more opportunities for students to feel welcome. Nothing is mentioned about lowering acceptance standards or choosing applicants based on race.,As an Aggie I'm so sad reading these comments. So much ignorance and fear manifest in the remarks of the peanut gallery.  Keep up the good work TAMU. I can't wait to be hiring these aspiring young students when they graduate from an institution they otherwise wouldn't have been able to attend. Gig 'em 👍,Whoop! Great move by a great school! I can’t wait to see more high-achieving kids and profs give A&M a chance.,I attended A&M for the quality education. If A&M is no longer a merit-based institution::: I and many other Former Students will no longer be contributing my annual donations.,Oh my God::: so much hand-wringing in these comments. Equity is not pie - fairness to someone else does not mean less opportunity for you. Outreach and scholarships are an amazing idea for a school that - love it though I do - has a horrible track record of reaching out to non-white students and faculty and making them feel welcome. Well done::: A&M. This former student heartily approves.,Seems to me more important things need to be addressed at this time. Things that are a matter of life and death..,Just provide a good education. Keep those standards up. The rest is posturing and appealing to the woke crowd.,The money would be better spent on helping at risk students in elementary::: junior high and high school. Throwing money at the problem once they graduate high school doesn't magically prepare them for college.,I thought affirmative action did that. A&M::: you are better than the virtue signals you put forth.,So tired of money being sent to minorities instead of just a hard working kid who worked hard to get in and could benefit immensely with some financial aid. Students should be awarded for hard work.,So because my kids are 4th generation Aggie and white they mean nothing. They do not get scholarships. They do not get advantages. Thanks. How about give scholarships to the best no matter the color of your skin or if your parents went to college. My kids have worked just as hard as anyone else.,This is the vision set forth by President Rudder. The vision of a World Class University. All voices. All Aggies. Terrific direction. Gig ‘Em. Class of ‘94.,This is not why people go to A&M.,The university appointed a very high paid individual when my daughter was at A&M. It’s not that they reject students of color but rather that Texas A&M tends to not be attractive to people of more liberal political leanings. It is a conservative university with values that should not change just to fit into the current PC environment. Don’t lower the quality of education and admission requirements. Bring in the best students despite race::: religion or gender.,Wow. Nowhere in the statement did it say it would lower the standard for non-white students. So let’s use the good Aggie engineering degree I have to see what the data tells us. (This is data from a year ago but it’s good enough for now.). State school should strive to educate a student body representative of the state population. Looking at the data we see that Hispanic population comes closer to state percentages. But what is shocking is the very low African American population. That’s just sad. And with the number of student athletes that make up the current enrollment I wonder what the percentage is for non-athletic African American students.  White 60.3% Hispanic/ Latino 24.1% Asian 7.7% Black or African American 2.8% Non-Resident Alien 1.4% American Indian or Alaska Native 0.2% Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander 0.1% Ethnicity Unknown 3.3%,Hard to believe you have gone so liberal. TAMU use have great values.. not so much now.. sad..,Thank you A&M for these programs::: without them I would have never been able to graduate from such a wonderful school. ❤️,Better idea: don’t even ask “race” on applications. Reject the premise that some sort of nebulous racial quota is an indication of anything more than Texas A&M pathetically attempting to accommodate a social zeitgeist. Don’t insult students by instituting admissions policies that will forever and always compel them to ask whether their acceptance to TAMU was based on their actual academic qualifications or their skin color.  Do better than this::: you clowns.,Sadly I hope the university keeps its high standards and doesn't bend it for identity politics.,So this school is donating $25MM to pay for scholarships and initiatives to show the world we are “more diverse” because we allow students to come based on race and not qualifications. Isn’t college about taking qualified students and turning them into quality adults? Frankly::: as a graduate::: donor and season ticket holder::: I am embarrassed at the direction the school I love so much is going. First tearing down statues that are simply part of history. Now this. What’s next? Unisex bathrooms on campus and in Kyle Field? Why don’t we just cave in and have a March with vagina hats like “other” schools in Texas. A&M will make a big mistake with this initiative with so many that give back and cherish the lessons we learned at Texas A&M... to be a bold leader in a world that wants you to conform to status quo.,Did I read this article wrong? Nowhere did I see they would be admitting anyone based on skin color. I read the article as they would put more funds towards recruiting from schools that have a minority population. They would put funds towards letting the minority population know how to apply for scholarships. Did I miss something?,True diversity is making everything based 100% on MERIT::: not income::: gender::: race::: etc.,The university had offices to recruit minorities back in the 70’s. 45 years later and that is the recommendation? Inspired,"Perhaps the first item should have been ""Expand the Student Pipeline while not lowering standards.""",The tragedy is that universities are only interested in diversity of skin color::: not diversity of thought.,So college entrance exams only apply to white people?,I don’t know why someone is mad at this. This is fantastic!,I predict there's a bunch of racists on here that are big mad.  Edit: yup,First Aggie in my family::: and this truly makes me smile even bigger. WHOOP!! 👍🏽👍🏽,Diversity? YES!! Critical Race Theory? NO!! Make sure you get this right A&M or you will lose support from me and thousands of other Aggies forever. We don’t subscribe to a theory that divides people based on their skin color::: or to a political party like Democrats that so badly uses and manipulates the black community for their own gain.,What about bringing people who care about A&M and its culture and not diversifying it just out of fear of being called racist?,Message of Unity!!! For those that qualify!!!,So race is more important than grades?,Recruit top::: no matter color of skin::: Fair enough. Sick and tired of being called racists if we do not agree with liberal unfairness. Of course election was a fraud!!!!,Great::: as long as admittance standards are not lowered::: we all applaud the effort.,I am horrified. So many of these comments are absolutely horrifying. To be honest::: if I read this comment section when considering attending A&M::: I would have come away with some very serious doubts.  Did most of you read the report? I don't think you even care too. You ask about recruiting the best regardless of color? Guess what? We can't because people think our campus is racist. And based on this report and on the many stories that came out last summer::: and I am sure the many stories that remain untold::: there fears have foundation. Deep::: systematic foundations.  All I can say is please::: please::: please read the report. The whole report. Please try to step away from your assumptions and prejudices and realize that members of our Aggie family are hurting. That A&M is not reaching its ideals but if we work together it can.  One last thing. Wide::: systematic change is needed to address the systematic racism in our country. But change is also needed on an individual level. We all::: including myself::: need to address our own prejudices and participation in racist systems and actively work to dismantle them. I have failed in this so many times but I will continue doing the work. I hope you will too. Texas A&M’s Six core values are of Respect::: Excellence::: Leadership::: Loyalty::: Integrity and Selfless Service. Working to make Texas A&M more Diverse::: Equitable::: and inclusive will only help us to come closer to these ideals.,How about set your standards::: students who meet them get considered::: those that don’t::: don’t. Straight up::: head to head based on merit. No race::: creed or color issiues. This whole program is racist at its core.,This is incredible and makes me proud to be an Aggie. Some of these comments on the other hand.....,So we are back to race....some people will get more according to the color of their skin! That is wrong! So::: not everyone gets an equal shot at getting in.........base d on merit::: interest::: now it all race!,The University’s commitment should be to unbiassed admission. Diversity should be a non issue. Applications for enrollment should not ask for gender or race period.,Why not just recruit the best?,Thank you for realizing there is immense strength::: value & creativity when we intentionally choose diversity. 💗,I don’t know that this initiative necessarily equates with a lowering of standards. Could it be that minority students do not view ATM as favorably as they do other universities and therefore they don’t choose to go to ATM? I would imagine this is a complex issue.,"Only someone so completely out of touch with reality would equate A&M creating initiatives aimed at addressing issues of diversity as something that's ""lacking in values"". If anything::: it is a breath of fresh air for A&M to finally start the work towards increasing diversity on its campuses where it's been a long standing issue for decades.",$25mill is about 250-500 new students yearly tuition::: depending on the degree level?? That’s it? Love ya a&m but if you are trying to make a social statement::: make it bigger,How about we award the scholarships to those worthy::: have worked hard to earn it::: and will do the most with it? Does awarding it based on skin color alone discriminate against those more worthy that don’t have the specific skin color requirement?,Diversity isn’t all about race,TAMU is a great school::: but unpopular opinion: what if someone said it doesn't matter what 4 yr university you go to? Sure::: people have hard ons for the Harvard's::: the yale's::: the columbia's::: ect. I went to an in-town university::: TAMUCC (red headed step child to TAMU). Earned a bachelor's in Mech Eng Tech. Never held me back. Don't get me wrong::: big state universities are great schools::: but so are local community colleges and local universities. Not too many companies give a shit where you went to school::: with few exceptions. Plus they are cheaper. 1/3 of Americans have a bachelor's degree::: of which about a third of those are STEM degrees. Get one of those degrees and sign your own meal ticket.,You know we already increased diversity significantly more than t.u. over the last 15 years without really trying::: at least that’s what I seem to remember. Imagine what we’ll do when actually trying.  I’d like to see more transfer scholarships for minorities from the Midwest. Or just anyone from the Midwest. Go where the opportunity is::: I say::: but A&M can help them get there,When I took my daughter for her NSO at Texas A&M they touted their admission rate at 86% top ten percent of every school in the US. My daughter was top ten at Harlandale HS and is in the spring semester of her third year. She’s outperformed her classmates from more prestigious high schools through Texas because she works hard and proves everyday that she belongs to her program. She’s Hispanic/ Latina and hasn’t gotten any help. We take out the loans and will pay them back like we’re supposed to. This would help::: but either way she’s going to finish and we’ll pay for her education whatever the cost. I’d rather sell a kidney before I told her she couldn’t do it. Good luck to all future Aggies no matter what color they are! Being the best has nothing to do with color or where you’re from. It has to do with how hard you’re willing to work. Gig ‘em!,There is so much potential to be found from students of all races and background. I am so happy to see the university try to support idea that greatness can be found in any individual. However::: I wonder how much better the quality of the student body would be if the cost of admission to EVERYONE was lowered while admission standards were kept the same. Obtaining higher education would become more feasible to low income and middle class families without obtaining massive amounts of debt that will burden the student for all of early adulthood. But still glad to see an effort to provide a way for many who would otherwise not be able to attend.,How is it going over everyone's head that POC have historically been at a disadvantage to go to college::: so that is what these scholarships and financial aid aim to help? You can't just ignore skin color people::: that's erasing all of the hardships that people go through due to being born a certain color. Why do you not instead::: ya know::: try and be happy that the less fortunate are getting opportunities that they may not otherwise would have received? Everyone deserves a chance::: especially the less privileged.,I applaud this! 👏🏻  Most of these minority kids are 1st generation college students. If they come to A&M 2-3 more generations will follow. Just like all of our parents and grandparents.  If we do not welcome diversity now in 20-30 years your grandkids won’t want to go there either.  Out of 60:::000 students I think we can make room for change.,Nothing more racist than qualifying someone simply by the color of their skin!,Continually amazed at how mad people get about increasing access for everyone to a great education. Helping one helps us all.,When he ran for office in2009::: my husband was asked if he supported “diversity”- he asked the interviewer to define “diversity” which the guy was unable to do.” I know it when I see it” was the gist of the response. So my husband proposed a scenario with one person from each country and region in the world with an exact mix of genders::: colors::: ages::: and income- would that meet the definition of diversity? Yes- of course the interviewer agreed. Then Dave said::: but they are all Catholic- now it is diverse? NO ! Was the quick answer. However::: had Had Dave said::: “they are all liberals” - the answer would have been- well yes -that is diverse.,Or maybe if we didn’t have to list race in our applications it would be completely even for everyone?,Give that the schools current makeup of students does not proportionately align with the makeup of our society::: why do you think that has occurred? What other solutions would you pose to right this wrong?,The color blind approach so many are advocating for in the comment section reeks of unidentified privilege and a shallow understanding of the challenges BIPOC face. The good news is that Texas A&M University has identified issues of diversity on campus and is taking action to address.  Initiatives like this make me increasingly proud to be a former student. Thanks and Gig’Em TAMU.,Thank you Texas A&M! My experience with this University enriched my life. I saw diversity in my professors in the business school and in my classmates. If you had a negative experience with a person(s) during your time there - I am sorry - and I certainly hope a few bad apples don’t spoil the whole experience for you. I appreciate the conversations being had by the decision makers at Texas A&M and this statement from the report “We will not tolerate disrespect of any Aggie by any member of our family::: nor will we tolerate the disrespect of Aggie traditions that bind us together....we believe we cannot achieve unity of pride and purpose for all Aggies unless we strive to ensure no Aggie is disrespected::: mistreated::: or excluded. If there are students::: faculty::: staff and former students who believe we fail to include them in the Aggie family::: we are not yet what we aspire to be.” Are we a finished product? No! Is anyone? No! Working towards excellence. I love it.,“Intelligence plus character-that is the goal of true education.” who wrote that? Go look it up A&M,Just don't be like Harvard and screw us Asians out. People should be accepted based on qualifications. TAMU did a good job when I went there in '98 to join the Corp and Aggie Band to use my 3-Year Army ROTC scholarship. First-gen Asian American::: first to go to college. I really sucked at the SAT/ACT::: like a 910. Thanks for accepting me into this great university. Now I'm in the top 5% of income earners. It's not about tests::: it's about heart and grit. I had buddies who had perfect scores in the SAT's and then failed out. Please use data scientists to find the right acceptance algorithms if you want to recruit. The best way to do this is to give scholarships based on what the USA needs in the workforce. If the USA needs nurses::: which is in dire need::: allocate more scholarships in that area.,Diversity is good. But I want real diversity::: not the faux diversity that you get from looking at a picture to see what someone’s skin color or gender is. Diversity of background::: diversity of thought::: diversity of passion::: diversity of experience::: diversity of socioeconomic::: etc.,It’s so disappointing to read some of the nasty comments here. For those that are Aggies on here::: we are better than this. Why does announcements or news story need arguments back and forth? Gig ‘em and God Bless! Let’s all do our best to shine light!,These comments are disheartening::: and show a lack of empathy and emotional intelligence. Sounds like everyone needs to go home and do the reading on white privilege and systemic racism. Thank you A&M for working to bring new ideas and perspectives to campus.,Wow I cant believe some of the comments on here. I graduated from A&M::: my friends and family ask me all the time how did you survive in a racists. Now that I look back A&M does lack diversity like crazy. I survived some how but I did see a lot of racism::: that’s why every wkd I would come to Houston or go to the cities to escape that from college station. I love being an Aggie but some of these aggies I see here I’m embarrassed to say they are Aggies. Because right away they went straight to the race thing smh 🤦🏻‍♂️,Wow::: these thinly veiled comments make me wish we could put Texas through a second round of Reconstruction. They clearly never got over Appomattox.,So idea. Let’s remove gender and sex questions on applications. Any other identifiers like name::: place of birth::: hometown are blacked out. Each applicant is assigned a number and then judged in the application process. This way we can make sure no one is choosing new students based on race::: gender::: sexual preference::: religion::: etc.,As long as it is only based on Merit such as GPA and graduating percentile etc. and not based on the ability to put any check mark next to having a certain amount of demographics or race. My Aggie worked hard and maintained being In the top 3% of her graduating class. It was not easy but it was worth it and she finished her first semester as an Aggie during COVID with 4.0.,Meanwhile::: many “extraordinaril y” bright::: intelligent kids::: with a mountain of potential::: get passed over and rejected...beca use of their race. That’s called being “racist.” It also spells our demise as a society::: when we strive towards mediocrity. Instead::: maybe spend some of that money on public primary and secondary schools in an effort to pull all kids upward::: regardless of race.,Why do people assume.. inviting minorities means lowering standards???! We're not dumb. It is literally less opportunity for POC's. The fact that this college is has less than 5% of an affrican American student body( including the athletic students) is a problem.,Race buckets divide us. Stop this madness. Scholarships should be based on merit and hard work not the color of our skin.,These steps are good but there are problems that Texas A&M cannot fix because they start years before students are old enough for college. The university is trying to recruit a larger percentage of a group of individuals that only make up less than 13% of the US population. Let’s not kid ourselves::: the minority population being recruited is the black population but there are certain segments of the black population that deal with problems such as fatherlessness and a lack of emphasis on education. See Thomas Sowell of the Hoover Institute on the current black culture.  https:// youtu.be/ JtyoNSmOYzo,Regarding Sully::: “In Conclusion” did not conclude anything::: but if you read between the lines::: Sully is gone. It will only be time before something else is deemed offensive and removed in the name of diversity.,It doesn't sound like A&M will be lowering their admissions standards AT ALL. It's already a competitive school and will remain so. That said::: often talented students from underrepresente d minorities are recruited with cash-money by private schools with deeper pockets. It seems to me that this effort will keep more talented underrepresente d kids here in Texas and will create a more diverse educational environment for ALL students...an environment that will more closely reflect the real world that they will graduate into.,You going to use this same principle in diversity of football and basketball players?,Carlyle I thought students chose A&M because of it's academic standards as well as traditions like its renowned ROTC programs. I know that is why I seriously considered it. Had I felt that it was a bastion of racism I never would have considered it. And I believe most scholarships are based on monetary need and not applicant ethnicity.,Caucasian station. If you're white and complaining about investments(not admittance based on skin color) in people of color::: your white privilege is showing.,Why not offer the scholarships through traditional black churches based on character::: discipline::: morality::: and tenacity? Are these not the values that made A&M great? A&M drew these students out of society::: they have not always instilled these values. Especially since leadership has focused away from them and toward progressive orthodoxy.,There are a lot of students that need assistance that don’t get a penny(mine included). I know some of the tuition I pay goes towards helping those that need assistance. Will that stop since there is now scholarship money?,I am honestly baffled that so many Aggies are saying racism doesn’t exists but then spewing hate in racism? As an Aggie::: I am disgusted by some of these comments. Do better.,Yes::: diversity is healthy. However::: perhaps the university should just focus on equality and let diversity happen naturally. Anything less than seeing everyone as equal humans is racist. Admit students based on merit and hard work. Not their ethnicity or race. Admitting less qualified students (diversity over merit) only serves to hurt the students you’re trying to help. They may not be ready for the rigors of university::: therefore you’re setting them up to fail. Hiring professors based on their ethnicity is racist. Equality is good. Equity is racist.,A&M has joined the PC crowd. The University is headed for mediocrity.,Well::: funny enough I applied there::: got accepted::: and ended up not going because they wouldn’t give scholarships. Even fafsa would give me 6k for a community college but A&M gave me 1k. Plus staying on campus plus 20k in tuition. Ended up going somewhere where they valued my education.,Affirmative action didn't work 30 years ago. All you have done is rename it under diversity. Just try and get the BEST students and faculty. The more you push diversity the more you divide people. Different standards for different people does not bring people together!,A&M is already diverse! I think the school should put its money into better student life!,Comments looking like Hopwood v. Texas all over again.,I think this is racist. What about disadvantaged white students.,I was denied grants due to this same type of occurrence in the past at A&M. They do this and the percentile of drop outs shows an increase in those accepted.,Why ruin a great school by making changes.? When it is doing great::: leave it alone.,What is the ratio you consider diverse?,“Equal rights for others does not mean less rights for you. It’s not pie.”,I don’t know much about critical race theory but it sounds suspicious and I hope it’s not introduced at A&M and divide aggies,🤨 some of these comments::: they’re just helping kids who already qualify to get into the college pay for it. I’m all for it::: A&M does a lot of things to upset me but this isn’t one of them.,SMDH TRUE AGGIE SPIRIT NEVER HAVE AND NEVER WILL BE EQUAL UNLESS THEY RUNNING OUT THE TUNNEL FOR U ON SATURDAYS,How about just sticking with content of character and God given ability?,Let's start with removing the racist Sul Ross statue and replace it with the real founder of Texas A&M::: Matthew Gaines.,Targeting certain racial and ethnic groups while rejecting and discriminating against others based on their race or ethnicity... huh there's a word for that but I can't quite put my finger on it.,Too much interchangeabil ity between Texas A&M University and the A&M System. The graduates of 10 of the System universities are not Aggies. Don't confuse the two.,Here’s an idea PICK AGGIES. Race::: creed::: origin::: none of that matters to us. We want RED BLOODED AGGIES that want to be here and want to be true to our traditions.,It should be based on merit only. Turning into t.u.,wow::: I'm glad I graduated last semester. The thing is a degree's worth comes part from the school it came from::: I hope Texas A&M doesn't tarnish its name and values for a fad.,What about any tradition that tears us apart?,Free cannoli and the other dogs in the lab. You offered him up for adoption but then shipped him to another lab. He deserves a chance to be surrounded by people who love him and will not torture him. https:// youtu.be/ zFE0NvVk6l4,Did the Administration ever do anything about the guy who put the racist notes on his own car? That really needs to be addressed first.,I would rather see them spend the money on promising “students”::: that reflect the values and principles of Texas A&M. What the hell does skin color or minority status have to do with anything???,Why doesn't A&M recruit THE BEST students and faculty and strive for excellence? Isn't it racist to treat people a certain way::: or give them things (like scholarships) because of the color of their skin::: or their origin? Diversity for the sake of diversity is wrong.,How about making college affordable while also making sure you have a balance of conservative and liberal professors and staff. Entrance standards should not include skin color or gender or any other criteria that is unequally applied. My $.02...,Ok ok for y’all saying “recruit the best” they got 25 million dollars to “recruit the best” in minority schools. In other words people that can’t afford Texas A and M. Why can’t y’all Just understand that.,As long as they are the best students i don't care what race::: gender::: anything they are. When you recruit purely base on one of the above items::: then you are nothing more than a racist or sexist and doing nothing but furthering the idea that they are 'different' and need help because they are not as good as everyone else....,Proud of the Aggies,“Minority student pipeline” what on earth is that??,You should have a certain grade average & students with C's:::D's & F's not allowed! I guess they aren't??,After MANY years::: I no longer support t.u. because of their tsip ways. The students at t.u. that were drawing top scholarships began to tell the administration what they would and wouldn't do. Scholarships pointed toward high IQ students regardless of race I could understand. I don't understand this racist move and have no doubt that this is racist.,What garbage. Nothing about effort and merit. Skin color?? THIS IS RACISM. It's shameful. How about you stop tracking data about race and just consider who has earned and deserves their place on campus???,The name of Texas A&M is enough to initiate.,"And the::: ""Shakedown"" has begun! This is called::: ""The Bite or La Mordida"" down below the Rio Bravo. Whatever Texas A&M pays and gives these Thugs will never be enough. They will always return for more and more. My pet dog Nimrod has enough brains to figure this scam out....",As a student that worked hard to get in::: I agree completely in giving more funds to students for the same standards I was compared to. But as someone who worked hard quite literally for hundreds of scholarships only to not receive a single one because i am not seen as “in need” is more than disheartening. Now I have tens of thousands of debt.... and now there are only more scholarships that will exclude my “disappointingl y average” status and leave me with no less of a debt to whoever decided to raise my tuition $500 this semester. $500 I haven’t had to pay before::: yet I’m receiving the same amenities. $500 that was going towards my rent and food that puts me farther into the sinking pit of absence of financial stability.,Did anyone commenting actually read the report? Was just posted but all of you already have opinions. Smh,This approach should need based and need based only. Poor whites::: poor Hispanics:::::: poor Asians are all disadvantaged . The only way basing this on race holds water is if the school HAS BEEN willfully and purposefully denying applicants based solely on race.,Damn there's a bunch of triggered white people commenting here.,Very sad to see A&M join in the social pandering.,Thank you Texas A&M!,I am a Texas A&M graduate and I am appalled at how many people just assumed that the school ranking and prestige would decline with the addition of more minority students. That is racist thinking and I would think my Aggie sisters and brothers would be above that. It is unfortunate that not everyone’s parents can pay for their child’s education so they rely on scholarships. One problem is that many people think just because you are a minority and get a scholarship it means you were accepted on “affirmative action” and didn’t earn your spot. The other problem is some schools will have one white and one minority candidate with the same scores and extracurricular activities and the school will almost always choose the white student over the minority. That’s how it’s been for YEARS. A&M is finally trying to change this stigma and allow opportunities for minority students::: who deserve to be there::: to attend college. I personally worked very hard to get into A&M and graduated with a BS in biochemistry. I then went on to obtain a masters in Pharmaceutical Chemistry from UFl. I worked as a toxicologist for a while and now I am in Pharmacy school. While I did not receive a scholarship::: A&M gave me the skills I needed to succeed in life and the knowledge to further my education. I pray that more minorities will be able to receive the same opportunities.,Isn’t this::: by definition::: raciest?🤷🏻‍♀️,“ one Aggie ring in every Texas family” The reality of that is totally impractical. Why not just say you will reach out to underprivileged children regardless of their ethnicity. It is just as wrong to ignore or pass over someone for an opportunity because they do not help your school meet your goal in this new program.,"""Diversity"" just means ""lets make this place less white.""",Everyone now likes to use the word equity vs equality! Why,Yep::: true diversity is equality in opportunities::: not results,Shame on A&M not diverse enough! ** EXTREME SARCASM **,The amount of low key racism from only white people in this comment thread is disgusting and proof that the school needed to improve on this. Way to go A&M!,Y'all are sick if you can't see this as a good thing::: Gig 'em!,Unity is more important than diversity!,Y’alls racism is showing in these comments!,I think I need to remind some people who have commented on here about the potential ramifications of some of their accusations and comments. Facebook does not shield you from liability for your comments::: even if you think they are well-intended opinions. When you make untrue statements to third parties (all of us in this group) about others with the intent to harm them or take any action to threaten them or cancel them by contacting their employers::: you are still liable for slander::: defamation::: and interference with business relationships under the laws of this state. You may not have any money now::: but judgments taken against individuals in this state::: if property memorialized::: last for a period of ten years. And::: if permitted::: those judgments can be re-memorialized with the courts for an additional ten years. So::: even if you don't have any money now::: a person can -\-\ and probably will -\-\ ruin you financially for the next twenty years. Think twice before speaking once.,Shouldn’t it be merit based? Just saying::: seems that we should be judged not by our skin color...,How’s that diversity at Prairie View,It’s like 100 M&Ms in a bowl. 90 red and 10 blue. You’ll keep grabbing handfuls of red unless you seek out the blue. That’s why you can’t blindly grab if you want some blue in there. #wreckemtech #gunsup 🔫🔫🔫😎,“They better not lower the standards to get in😡”  Our acceptance rate is 70%,what is to become of Sully?,Very interesting discussion...I would encourage anyone who wants to learn more about the challenges minorities and first-gen students face in higher education to read Paul Tough's book::: The Years That Matter Most. Universities like A&M are critical in making sure our country encourages social mobility - making it possible for high-achieving::: low-income Texans to attend::: graduate and thrive as citizens. Creating the environment to attract and retain those students takes work and money::: and I::: for one::: am proud A&M is doing it.,racists in the comments: “just don’t lower the standards! no such thing as systematic racism! none of this is racist!”  also racists in the comments: literally do not understand how racist it is to assume that standards must be lowered for BIPOC students to be accepted...,No more funding for you TAMU. I don’t support this bullshit. Stick that liberal shit up your ass.,Whoop! It’s long over due. I personally witnessed and experienced the worst racism at this school. Anyone that visits there will immediately know what I’m talking about.,Racism is taking someone based on their race. That commen sense doesn't require a college degree!! Don't cower down to the commie BS and lose your values. Go to UT::: Berkely::: NYU or anywhere else if you want that.,Students have been sharing the racism & discrimination they have experienced and are asking for diversity training for students::: faculty::: and staff. Any non-minority that thinks A&M doesn’t have problems is misinformed. Aggies are kind and therefore there isn’t a lot of hateful behavior towards POC::: but institutional racism is still an issue.,Do not mistake what’s right for racism. I am so sick of people thinking::: that because you give all this money to diversity that your going to somehow cure this “systemic racism”. The deal is::: you work had you get the results. In fact saying that minorities need all this extra help is actually insulting their intelligence.,All of the butthurt conservatives in this comment section can go eat shit. 🖕 😂,Does this include recruitment of conservative professors and students. To combat the liberalism?,"Is this where we can also abandon science and ""identify"" as whatever the hell we desire::: in order to get a scholarship?",Seems like A&M is above average nationally in diversity and gender. https:// www.collegefactu al.com/ colleges/ texas-a-and-m-un iversity-colleg e-station/ student-life/ diversity/,"I'm not sure if anyone else has pointed this out yet since it's so obvious::: but maybe it would be more efficacious to ""show bold leadership in support of diversity::: equity and inclusion; to commit to improving our campus climate; to trust one another; to have difficult conversations; and to ensure that ALL Aggies are welcome and respected at the school we think so grand"" if we simply admitted fewer racist xenophobes in the first place? Otherwise::: we continue to do nothing to improve the climate for minorities::: only given minorities additional financial incentives to subject themselves to it.",Giving scholarships based on the color of someone’s skin is::: in fact racist. As a Caucasian Female I had no access to any of these scholarships. With two teachers for parents my family made “too much” for government aid and far too little to afford to help with college. The only scholarships I received were merit based because I worked so hard in high school to receive a top rank and high honors. I worked a full time job all 4 years of my college life. I still had to take out over 30k in student loans. If you give a scholarship to someone else in my same predicament based on skin color alone::: you are the true racist.,13% of the population is going to get 50% of the slots...,People here claim they have a PhD::: but they can’t read a simple article.

My grandson’s advisor is so stressed and poorly trained that he almost cried. It is an injustice to both. I am so disappointed in this complete incompetence and neglect on the part of the university. I have lost so much respect and interest in all the “wonderful “ football and new buildings being built. You do not care for your loyal Aggie students and their hardworking families.Shame on you!🥲,So in my 4::: the main rec was under construction the whole time::: but now less than 4 years later::: there’s now a second rec?!,Really surprised that they're able to get away with building in the area now. All of the land on the front side of campus was supposedly donated with a stipulation that nothing would ever be built there::: and that the area would be permanently reserved for recreational use. Although I don't know when Polo was ever a big sport on campus::: lol.,So glad they can't afford to offer many of my majors courses this semester::: but they somehow have the money to build yet another unneeded workout space on the backs of the students. 😒,Bush Sr.::: stopped by and worked out when I was at the student Rec::: around 2004.,How does this work in the COVID-19 era?,Wow!

There are now two Texas A&M Rec Sports Texas A&M Rec Sports facilities in Aggieland!  The new Polo Road Rec Center is located on University Drive across from Zachry and provides more space for Aggies to exercise and take care of their physical and mental health on main campus.,2021-01-22 19:36:21,Here’s to all those students and Professors that are making it through this pandemic! You are wonderful and amazing! The facility looks wonderful!,The university needs a better teaching and counseling staff. Poorly trained and understaffed. It is an injustice to both the students and the staff. It is especially horrible for the students during this COVID pandemic. I see all this expensive “cool” stuff and I feel so much disrespect for the university. I have 3 grandchildren currently attending the university and I feel so sorry for them and their hardworking parents. It appears that the students and their are very low on the list of importance. I so wish you would use some of that super Aggie money on the students. I am a super fan::: I am ashamed of your priorities.,Graduated almost 16 years ago and still miss the Rec almost every day.

All students living or working on campus this semester must test for COVID-19 by today's deadline.  Find more information about the three-step testing process::: as well as locations of quick and free on-campus testing: tx.ag/Jan22Deadline,2021-01-22 16:22:16,My doctor admitted that depending on the cycle threshold (CT) the lab uses::: the results could yield over 90% false positives. And only now has the WHO basically admitted such by officially telling labs to run tests at no more than 35 cycles of amplification. Labs until now have been allowed to run up to 40 or more CT. So naturally::: “cases” will now decrease.,If I didn't already have my useless degree (it's not liberal arts - it's Molecular and Cellular Biology but now that fake science is the norm::: real science is thrown to the side)::: I'd have refused to go back and deal with this garbage. Testing doesn't do anything treatment-wise or prevention-wise .,When is the next COVID-19 testing deadline? Or once you test::: are you good to go indefinitely?,They need to be prepared for possible side effects::: children with altered DNA and a chance of not making their 25th reunion. You will never see another penny out of me for violating the students civil rights.,These reactions are shocking! My daughter is a senior at USC and she can’t even be on campus for in person learning her last semester. Aggies should be grateful they are in a state that allows them to be on campus let alone live there. Follow the rules or just go home. Moan all you want but attending this school is not your right::: it’s a privilege.,I::: Aggie alumn::: now go to UTT nursing school in which we must get tested WEEKLY to ensure we are negative so we can go to clinicals. There are more things to worry about in this world than having to get ONE covid test Ags. Be better.,Please note. We all now live in a hybrid world. Not all classes are live. Not all folks will become ill::: nor die from the circumstances. That being said::: practical precautions are wise to exercise.,Have we lost all common sense?? Unless EVERY test is 100% correct::: and ALL people in the community are tested at the EXACT same time::: and NO ONE is allowed to leave or enter that community::: this makes no sense!!!! It only takes: • 1 incorrect negative test::: or • 1 person in the community that doesn’t live or work on campus that has COVID and will spread it to somebody that is living or working on campus::: or • 1 person that as much as stops for gas in CS area that has COVID and spreads it to someone in the community:::  to negate this entire testing cycle. The problem is not going away::: because people are blinded by the false security provided by these tests. How much money is being wasted on these “mandatory” tests::: just to potentially have it all negated by just 1 of those tested contracting COVID 5 minutes after their negative test?,Unless they are testing weekly this doesn’t accomplish much. Just take the test so everyone can feel better about it and move on.,Baylor is requiring weekly tests. Stop whining and set a good example for your kids. Let’s do what we need to to get past this pandemic!,This makes no sense. Unless you’re going to also conduct bi-weekly or monthly tests what does a negative test now prove? It’s not like a negative test now clears you for the rest of the semester from potentially becoming infected.,So those who have no symptoms::: have been social distancing::: etc are required to submit to a test or lose jobs or housing? Is A&M going to tattoo their arms? Shouldn’t they test for AIDS too? If it saves just one life...  This is fascist.,Well ... they are the same university that the band had mouth cutouts in their masks so the could play their instruments through them ... smh,This is nothing new. Many have been positive and quarantine in their rooms.,I think they should just take the test once so everyone can feel better about it and then move on....,Not your choice because you can infect other bodies around you,Too bad this testing requirement doesn't apply to all students studying on campus as well. The gap in the mandate was easy to see::: stupid to overlook and threatens the welfare of all those on campus who did get tested.,Public universities already require certain vaccines to attend them  Y'all are getting bent out of shape over a covid test,Which test are they being tested with? How will you rule out false positives from other coronaviruses?,Will A&M provide vaccines for the staff and students ?,Being former military I won’t get tested or get the vaccine nor will I be a sheep and wear a mask. They are not 100% effective just like the Vaccine.,Some colleges are requiring testing twice a week and it’s required to be done as a pass that is shown from their phones to access the dorms. Aggies got it easy...people should stop complaining before they’re having qtips shoved up their noses 40+ times a semester.,Some of you Aggies need to travel around the world an experience communism for real.,Thank you A&M for keeping us safe! Whoop! 👍🏼,Texas A&M... you have got to be kidding me::: are y’all seriously requiring a test for a bunch of college students who most likely don’t take wearing a mask or deadlines for that matter seriously?!  It all starts now::: I suppose... 🤦🏻‍♀️,Thats crazy. Thought we ATM was smarter than that. Guess not.,What will happen if they don’t? Kids have been in class for 1 week. 🤷🏼‍♀️,Just thankful my two aggies and their friends are whining like these parents.,What a joke. Unfortunately::: A&M has fallen in with the evil forces of the fake pandemic. It's the FLU!,I guess my question is those off campus don’t have to.,Have to be careful with the a .02 mortality rate.,They should also do sobriety tests when they come back. That will eliminate the spread of drunkenness.,So test today::: it’s negative. Tomorrow it could be positive. Why the obsession with testing?,Didn’t think that a public university could infringe on a students rights.,You have a choice::: as do they.. You can choose not to get a test. They can refuse to allow anyone on campus without a test. My body my choice is a slogan some recite to justify murdering infants.,The WHO says PCR testing is NOT accurate if run more than 30 times. It also says that a positive test should be confirmed with a second test before diagnosing Covid.  If the university complies with those standard::: then test away. Otherwise::: you are just wasting time and money sending proabably healthy students home.,Who’s paying for all this?,I hope they’re paying for those tests. It’s $100 out of pocket for me.,What is that being thrown out the window? Oh::: it's common sense!!!!!!,Frickin' ridiculous. Quit living in fear because you were told to::: people!!,Are they also requiring daily health screenings before being on campus?,How long do the results take I’ve been waiting for days?,Work place or quit haha,Why must this be forced??,It called COMMUNISM,What if they don't?,We had to take the meningitis vaccine to get registered at A&M Galveston because of students dying on campus due to infectious mosquitoes. But of course this isn't meningitis::: and there aren't infectious swarms of mosquitoes chasing you all over campus.,Negative today positive tomorrow???,Does that make sense?,Y’all are big babies if you are getting mad about a covid-19 test,I test every four days to visit my husband in rehab,Then what?,Maybe you need to think about someone besides yourself.,Why Won’t you be proud of A&M,Why are all these people who never went to A&M and don’t live anywhere near B/CS commenting?,"Yall betta tell them students the truth about them shots! Isn't it funny how the US reports the shots as ""Emergency Use"" and ""Safe & Effective"" and other counties report it as ""Human Experiments"" and ""Clinical Trials""::: looks like the Tuskeege all over again!  My daughters in college and I'm not a fan of forcing her to partake in these vaccine clinical trials. Students are our future::: they should have a choice to decline. Can we learn from Israeli's example and give them a choice?  ""Reading the contract signed between the Israeli government and Pfizer::: it is clear::: unequivocal and unambiguous that this is a clinical study for all intents and purposes::: and thus::: it needed to be approved by the Helsinki Committee:::"" a senior official explained to Calcalist::: adding: ""And that's what will be written in the Committee's opinion: 'There's nothing wrong with clinical trials::: on the contrary::: but clinical trials (human trials) must get committee approval::: and of course::: from the people on whom the trial is being conducted::: while giving the right to refuse to be part of the trial. These are very basic matters:::"" he concluded.  https:// www.israelnation alnews.com/ News/News.aspx/ 295134  N.J.

My little Marshall is prone to matted fur on his scrotum so I need to keep an eye on it. You can tell when he is smarting as his stride is shorter and he refuses to stoop fully when passing a stool. If Marshall does struggle I shall email the vet with a photo of his scrotum and I should get a referral to the groomers. I hope yourself and Gloria are in good health.

Update regarding potential for COVID-19 vaccine access at Texas A&M: http://tx.ag/COVIDNote115,2021-01-15 16:22:19,"As usual::: the truth is somewhere in the middle. Yes::: the testing phase was accelerated. And yes::: it has shown to be safe for the vast majority of people who've taken it so far. I wouldn't worry too much about your child being ""forced"" to take it at this time. By the time there are enough doses to get to them::: there will be more information out there regarding possible reactions (which can occur for any vaccine::: so not exclusive to this one).",I had the Pfizer vaccine. First shot was nothing. The second shot kicked my ass as expected. It was confirmation to me of conferred immunity from first shot. Nothing comes for free. Some will have reactions. True::: there is no long term data. Really a risk and benefit decision. I am high risk for exposure and have seen enough covid to not want it including one of my close friends who continues to suffer from “Covid brain” and afib from a Covid viral cardiomyopathy.,Very interesting read::: except for a little individual snarkiness.

I work in healthcare and WILL NOT take this vaccine.,I'm an RN and have done a lot of research from peer reviewed and respected sources and have made a lot of things public on my page if you would like scientific based information. Neither I or any of my coworkers who have received the vaccine or anyone we know has any reaction other than what is to be expected (sore arm::: low grade fever::: and body aches and not everyone had those (I only had a sore arm)).,I was on Judge Joe Brown. As a plaintiff.,I will not take it either. Too soon and not sure what the real side effects are. If you want::: go ahead and take it but don't push it on me::: either.,I don’t think people should rush for a vaccine that was in speed production!!! Not enough trials done to reassure me!

Production of two COVID-19 vaccine candidates have begun at Texas A&M.  The federal government reserved capacity at the FUJIFILM Diosynth Biotechnologies facility in College Station to manufacture vaccines through the end of 2021.  TODAY.TAMU.EDU Texas A&M System Subcontractor Begins Production Of Two COVID-19 Vaccine Candidates - Texas A&M Today,2021-01-11 16:27:11,Great news! The press release says 2 vaccines will be produced::: but only names the Novavax vaccine - what's the other vaccine candidate that will be produced?,It’s like some of the people on here received no higher education at A&M.,"My PRAYER is that the Aggie Nation CLOSELY SUPERVISES AND APPROVES of what the ""Subcontractor"" is putting into the ""vaccine"". I have NO TRUST IN THIS.......",I will not put poison in my body even if this avaricious University produces it!,I use to be not open to getting the vaccine::: however up here in Abilene TX::: we are loosing at least 1-5 people A DAY to this virus!!! Our 2 hospitals are at capacity (hovering around 130 hospitalized) . People are not washing their hands (I’ve watched them walk out of bathroom). Corona virus itself has been around and so has research on vaccines::: they are not dealing with a completely foreign virus::: just a different strain (as they do with the flu every year ). Let’s not call names to those who don’t want it nor want it. It’s their choice. We just need a good percentage of people who will.,I got my vaccine 18 days ago...Got u knowingly exposed on day 13 and I’m still ok. Only a sore arm for 48 hours...get vaccinated when it’s your turn!,Just asking because I don't know! Is this a new vaccine that has not been approved yet or is it one of the vaccines that has been approved.,Side effects of these are: conservative values::: a craving for Shiner Beer and Dixie Chicken and you will bleed maroon...,The sooner the better. Crank out those vials forthwith. 👍,I think they should just give it do everybody who wants it now. Anybody who is vaccinated is protecting themselves and everybody else who they come into contact with. This process is way too slow.,Their slogan should be gig em in the arm,Do not want any of the aborted fetuses material.,And your thumb will be in BBC a permanent up position👍,Tired: “No thanks I love pandemics and shutdowns”  Wired: “Hell yeah end this pandemic”,And let me guess who you were experimenting with a vaccine on?? ...The dogs that you keep in cells all over the campus and let you breed over 100 dogs just to experiment on them! Maybe one day someone will take one of your children and experiment on them and give the muscle dystrophy so they can see how their body reacts to it all.. interesting 🤔,Bravo science!,Finally!!

A new Texas A&M Rec Sports center is coming to the south side of campus! The new rec center will provide an additional space for Aggies to exercise and focus on their health and well being.  The 63:::000 square-foot facility will include strength and conditioning areas::: basketball and volleyball courts::: a climbing wall::: as well as an indoor soccer field: tx.ag/SouthsideRec,2021-01-09 01:21:00,The university has an excellent facility already. I use the very small DeWare Fieldhouse and walked everywhere. A&M should consider not building this and focus on lower tuition. Class of 87,Do you all realize how inexpensive TAMU in-state tuition is? It's $10-$12K::: while most states are $18-20K. Also much of their funding is based on oil and gas income::: which is not good right now.,That is totally awesome! Great for the students!,This would have been great when I was on Campus living in Rudder!,Rec has come a long way from DeWare Fieldhouse....,Why don’t you build a bigger department of multicultural services? Or another 24 hour library that doesn’t require students to hike 15 minutes in the middle of the night when there studying? We already pay almost $90 a month for the rec center regardless if we use it or not::: how much more will this cost students?,Isn't that what the OTHER ONE is for??? How about a cut in tuition since the students aren't even ON campus?,I hope this includes a practice gym area for your 2x national champions competitive cheerleading team! They deserve it:),How about just cutting back on the number of students! Way too many on campus now::: some haven’t even chosen well,I’ll never forget the student body voting to NOT RAISE TUITION PRCIES FOR RENOVATIONS FOR THE ALREADY REC CENTER WE HAVE & Y’all not caring and doing it anyways 😂,Administrators and Board of Directors so out of touch with the common student. PEOPLE CARE ABOUT SKYROCKETING TUITION costs and you come up with a second recreational center after just revamping and overhauling the football stadium?,How about making more accessible hours for ags that work full time and go to school? That way we don’t have to pay for these centers that we can’t use and a gym membership?,So what happens to the old Rec Center?,If y’all are complaining about this wait until y’all hear about the east campus expansion all the way to the corner of university and Texas. 😂,Class of 1994. For the mathematicians out there enrollment has only increased about 20% in the last 25 years. The numbers you are using include programs that do not use local services and therefore yes the excess is not justifiable based on enrollment. Having said that::: our beloved school as many already have::: has turned into educational Pyramid schemes. Unfortunately I believe schools like A&M are falling into that category where the cost does not justify the investment. I no longer recommend it for higher education and feel the deep traditions are being diluted.,I loved the new center when I was there! I went two hours a day! Great stress relief and more convenient for south side students! Awesome. A&M has amazing facilities for the fraction of the cost of other universities.,I am glad for this::: the one on west campus was always so busy when it was brand new when I was there,It will sit empty with no students on campus! Also::: just how much more financial burden do you think students can take on? A whole 10 minute walk & you need to spend $35M!! smh,People...we want free tuition...also we want to spend millions for a new gym so we don’t have to walk too far.,So question... is the current Rec center overwhelmed with students and can’t accommodate everyone????  After reading the comments then I’m very happy our school built this! Exercise is important,Nobody in the Corps used a “rec center” back in my day. We worked out in the hallways of our 1950 era dorms in full uniform at least twice a day.,Maybe they should have the Sorority rec center and the everyone else rec center. It was always frustrating trying to get on cardio equipment when the Sorority members (identified by their shirts) would take them up for hours on end.,Nice! It was a pretty long walk from Dunn to the rec center back in my day.,It seems like A&M abandoned the elite institutional goals from decades ago and has turned to perpetual expansion. Not a fan,Don’t worry everyone. The never ending rising tuition costs will cover this.,Oh that’s where our raises went 😒,Welp::: that would have been cool in 2005 hahaha! That’s a great idea!,In a year that you are expecting a big budget cut in the coming state legislature session::: you announce this? Are y'all not paying attention?,Meanwhile I assume important student services like disability services are still off in the middle of f’ing nowhere,Kids these days! When I was there::: I just considered the 20 minute walk and dodging the train part of my cardio.,We never had anything 30 years ago and now they're creating a 2nd one? Why is this needed??,Why?!? They honestly couldn’t do something with the current Rec Center?,Yet they told us they had no money to give us merit raises ....,One more reason to increase the tuition.,So...where on the south side has room for this,Can't help but think this money should go to lowering tuition fees,I’ll never forgive y’all for taking 3 years to build a new student services center but only taking 6 months to put up the hotel 😂,Billy Leeds and Briana Moeller we were robbed. Think of how many times Billy could have picked up my keys in this B,Huge waste of $ when other things should take priority,OMG! I was there when the current rec center was new and state of the art!,How about a free workout area? It’s called OUTDOORS!!! Hike::: bike::: run::: rollerblade::: etc...,In the basement Jason  No AC  Old astroturf was the floor,If it was being built by FHK it would look like a prison yard.,Texas A&M...how about a new student health center?,how about some parking close to the dorms,Anyone besides me remember working out in the smelly DeWare Fieldhouse weight room?,How about we listen to the students and put hot water in the dorms?,I'm excited that my great grandchildren can enjoy it when it's finally finished.,You have got to be kidding.,Only 1 floor?,So awesome!!! My daughter is going love it.,CJ Gonzales could you have imagined the amount of nonsense we could have had?,Where was all this stuff when we needed it Roger Feng,Garrett Rutherford this would’ve been nice to have on south side 14 years ago!,Tiffany Robinson Long is this a Mormon Mok design?,you can build this but you can’t lower/refund tuition to students struggling to afford school during a pandemic  don’t let a&m fool you into thinking they ACTUALLY care about students,I can't think of a more tone deaf investment into the student body of A&M. What about an on-site child care center to facilitate a broader student population? I believe this is an out-dated attempt to woo future students.

99 years ago today::: E. King Gill suited up and stood on the sidelines of the Dixie Classic::: ready to enter the football game if his team needed him. This simple act created one of the greatest traditions in college sports: the 12th Man! http://12thMan.tamu.edu,2021-01-02 15:12:00,What a great tradition it is! Gig’em 👍👍,Love my Aggies! Hope for a win today! Fidel,Best tradition in college football. That is all.,The ORIGINAL and ONLY true 12th Man!!! I can’t stand that the Seattle Seahawks stole the originality of this great tradition to use it for their stadium/fans. Just makes me cringe!!!,This is why traditions at A&M should be respected and passed on for future generations!,Welcome to the student body::: or as we fellow Texas A&M Aggies call it The 12th Man.,I agree. Makes me sick::: use to live in spake::: WA surrounded by seahawk fans. I lovingly call them the sea chickens because they are not majestic enough to be hawks,99 years ago TODAY! This is an omen! We will win!,The 12th Man is ready. BTHO North Carolina.,An old Gilmer kid played in that game. He has some stories. Mr. Henry was all SWC guard on the team at 165 lb. 👍,The 12th man started on 1/2?

We were an Aggie family.

BTHO North Carolina.,What was the sideline interference from us on the interception??,This is funny! A&M people said they should have been in over ND.

More than 20 years ago::: 250 people across our campus and community came together to lay out Vision 2020::: an aspirational outline designed to elevate and guide the future of Texas A&M University.  As the year 2020 concludes::: revisit the document with the leaders who helped shape it: tx.ag/Vision2020  TODAY.TAMU.EDU Vision 2020: Texas A&M’s Aspirational Document Revisited - Texas A&M Today,2021-01-01 02:03:43,Do not forget to raise a toast as we embark on a new year and start afresh wishing you all a HAPPY NEW YEAR,Fun fact- the administration tasked student government around 2002 to come up with a student version of Vision 2020 to show it had student support. When the student version didn’t match the leftist original plan::: the idea was scrapped.,Could have been one sentence.  We plan on being as woke as t.u. by 2020.  Good job ::: gender studies::: over paid office of inclusion::: football players acting like they have a job outside of entertainment::: etc. You're well on your way. Oh and erasing everything that is conservative or has to do with God.,Good bull::: Ags! 👍,Freedoms self destruct a society overtime. All the Progressive Shit is in place for self destruction::: It is just a matter of time,We just have to get rid of some of these crazy profs!,Happy New Year!,I was in Student Council when this was being formulated::: and was an enthusiastic supporter of the initiative. 25 years later::: I have concluded that while it was a financial boon and a boost to our prestige::: and resulted in certain program and materiel gains::: we gave up far too much of what made Texas A&M unique.,Musarrat Shahid,The beginning of the end of what made Texas A&M special.,Vision 2020 in a single emoji: 🤑,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
City of College Station - Government December 28::: 2020 at 5:09 PM ·  NEW: Our area has seen a COVID-19 hospitalization rate exceeding 15% total capacity for 7 consecutive days. That triggers immediate rollback steps per Gov. Abbott's exec. order; specifically::: for bars::: other businesses and elective surgeries.  Learn more: cstx.gov/covid19,2020-12-29 18:17:33,Lockdowns in CA has proven it doesn't help stop the spread.,THAT triggers it?!! Too little too late!! #GregAbbott who are you?!!,Jan Duncan Weir,The science says asymptomatic spread is a lie. I thought we were following science? A study of 10 million people in Wuhan shows ZERO asymptomatic transmissions. So why are we locking down asymptomatic people and destroying businesses?,Communism strikes again.,To the gates of north!,Lockdowns don’t work... this is ridiculous,But how many negative tests have there been? How many people have survived the ChinaVirus???? Why aren’t those numbers published???? STOP SPREADING FEAR!!!!! 🤦🏻‍♂️,aggieland - that says it all....,Some people think the virus is so smart that it knows the difference between a bar or restaurant and a Walmart. 🤦🏻,Reese Vandeven,I'm not gonna waste my time and call y'all all boneheads individually::: so I'm doing it here. Y'all are some boneheads. Call someone in your family that works in the medical field and do your own research like you did while you went to the best school in the country.,Is it just me::: or does it seem like Monty Python is in charge of the COVID policy for the country???,I've met a lot of people that had covid. I just don't know anyone that went the hospital because of covid. Great story.,For all of you asking about the students being gone for break NOW ... Hospital cases generally follow approximately a 12 day lag from case surge. We have 7 CONSECUTIVE days of beyond capacity hospitalization . This means we started that on Dec 21st::: which means infections were likely surging on or around first to second week of December when finals were occurring. What we are seeing now is likely a direct result of Thanksgiving travel and spread from that (think anywhere from 3-10day incubation until symptomatic infection) plus end of semester /graduation celebrations or Christmas parties. Now ADD the fact that those in the hospital have likely been there for days/weeks and you keep adding ....,Office of the Governor Greg Abbott needs to stop claiming “no more lockdowns” ... bc this is BS,Who cares? Covid won't hurt you.,Still waiting for Facebook to have an eye roll emoji thing for what you think about the post...,Fake crap. Who's hospitalized and why? What age groups? Once again the city and county don't provide any information just one data point. If hospitalization is all elderly and those with underlying conditions then restrict themv to their houses and let the rest of us go to work.,Tyler Booth,Stupid but not as stupid as the picture of the Aggie band with holes cut in the center of the masks. That’s just embarrassing 🙈.... I know I’m sure someone is going to tell me to do research or get educated. Get off of all of your high horses. If you are scared stay home. No one is going to make you leave your house. If wearing a mask makes you feel better about yourself::: then mask on up buttercup. But for crying out loud. Leave people alone that are not afraid.,Cynthia Benton,If there were any science behind this::: they would tell you how many cases it will prevent::: how many lives it will save and how much it will cost society. Then::: they would let us determine the cost/benefit ratio and say yes or no to more lockdowns. But::: they can't.,Zackry Simpson,Sheer stupidity.,Melissa Price,Brooke Johnson,Brady Manning,This is all political BS!,So embarrassing the lack of education apparent on a college page 😞,Didn’t all the kids leave?,Any changes to start date for students is my question?? Maybe not roll everyone back in till end of January.,Done with you::: Abbott. #SidMiller2022,As you read this::: 23 miserable dogs are still warehoused in TAMU’s laboratory::: cowering in metal cages without the affection or comfort that they deserve.

Loved the movie.,Great job!!! Gig em!!,Scarlett Higdon,👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼,Bethany Stoupine,Pres. Buhari will recognize dead men::: but ignore our Diaspora family who invested in Nigeria::: because Presidency stole from us and is still holding on to it. Ruling Nigeria without sense to recognize and resolve genuine complaints in the global world of today duly exposed him. Fantastically corrupt Nigerian institutions/ Lagos State. This is supposed to be our 63 million US dollars arson Allianz insurance claim. Pres. Buhari::: Magu of EFCC and other agencies::: DSS are using the language of looting to hold on to our claim. Knowing fully well using the British language ‘looting’ cannot change the ownership. The loot must return to us the beneficiaries::: while the looters are punished by good instructions. Former IGP MD Abubakar this horror commander from his CP Lagos era. (One of his close boy::: Frank Mbah from Enugu State::: is with the current IG::: Adamu.)  They’re from Daura::: Katsina State::: Borno State and Adamawa State. But are pretending to be Anacho Uzomba and Michiko and our three kids who lived in Den-en-chōfu::: Tokyo. Or Anacho who worked tirelessly in the sun::: rain and snow in our company::: Miana International Limited’s dockyard/okiba in Saitama-ken Great Japan. The strong strength of our claim. They must start behaving like humans and apologize for all their multiple horrors::: including to the families of the many murdered witnesses mainly in Lagos State::: because it is now clear to us why they used Greenoaks Global Holdings in Great Britain to hijack Union Assurance in 2014 and created many fake documents::: including faking human being and equally suing themselves to court: just to have access to our claim. They used all the institutions to openly rob one family and spread false rumors: Igbo man likes money::: but never say worked for his money.  Buhari with his APC party and his::: Northerners in Nigerian Customs::: were already on the ground in Lagos before he became president (the real face of our horrors)::: although for we APC with Buhari and PDP with Jonathan are the same in criminality. For too long::: one of them has owned and executed many taboo in Lagos State::: especially to our family. Money in the Nigerian treasury doesn’t belong to the criminal individuals/ groups::: but law abiding citizens of our country. Enemy of Nigerians with GTB suicide loan::: empty vessel Presidency::: allow us to receive our claim and stop the assault on the diversity and unity of Nigeria. Besides Pres. Buhari and EFCC did not bring any suspect who they claimed attempted to loot our insurance claim to face any criminal justice.  Unfortunately::: those media for authority often hide in lies “ hates for Buhari” which has no place in breaking of rules to justify stealing with system. New Chief of Staff::: Prof. Ibrahim Gambari::: Old Chief of Staff::: Abba Kyari::: Femi Adesina::: Lauretta Onochie::: Lai Mohammed and Garba Shehu should allow Pres. Buhari to read this our post.

Yet that doesn’t stop experimenters from stretching the dogs’ muscles with motorized levers and cutting out chunks of their muscles to examine.,Merry Christmas!,Merry Christmas and best wishes in the coming year!!👍👍👍,Merry Christmas!!,1. Ngozi Okonjo Iweala provided the Bonafide as a Minister::: UBA under Tony Elumelu was used by our company Nnojap to import the bikes via L/C::: our containers from Great China with waybill no: 482044098 dated 23 July 2005::: which were brought by Mitsui OSK Line of Great Japan to Apapa::: Lagos::: were diverted to Migfo Bonded Terminal and empty containers were released to us by Yoruba::: Hausa/Fulani tribe under Nigerian Customs. Those three names above are all from the same town::: Ogwashi-Uku/ Onicha-Uku area::: Niger Delta State.  2. You can see how the horror is written all over them. Their reason is nothing but bank suicide loan/blood money to squeeze any rich Igbo man to death under Nigeria controlled by their god-fathers. They will murder you under the Federal and State system and all security agencies will close their eyes as conspirators. Our civil suit No.FHC/L/CS/ 388/2007 against empty containers::: the two lawyers::: who have been frustrating the case for nearly 14 years::: are also from Ogwashi::: and our lawyer Osuala is assisting them too. Henry from Abatete in Anambra::: who married their sister::: tried to pull me::: Anacho::: out of Lagos by inviting me to a party in Asaba::: Delta State::: on 29 December 2005::: the day Ononuju from Nnewi brought empty containers to us. I suspected the genuineness::: and I did not go. The wife informed me they brutally murdered him for their failed evil plan. Actions lead to another.  3. They used this case to have access to us and chain us to be bleeding. With all the corrupt institutions and dishonest individuals they are swallowing the profits of our labor::: arson our houses in Abuja and Lagos::: and they used Lagos State to break into our rented industrial warehouse and showroom without notice and pack thousands of our motorcycles and marine engines etc::: and used fake garnishee to pack our dollars and nairas in Standard Chartered Bank::: but the Most High/Kamisama has proven to these agents of Lucifer that they have no single strength over His children. You can imagine how many wealthy Igbo men they have murdered and labeled them all the fraud they have committed with their company names; the good ones among us (the economic builders)::: which has contributed to many of our youths roaming around the world without direction under serious brainwash confusion.  4. Tony Elumelu was born in Jos. Baba Ajakaye from Ilesa in Osun State::: who lived near Captain Gowon in 208 Road in Festac::: found the house I::: Anacho::: bought whose owner was an ex-government officer from Jos. Baba and I along with the housing agent flew to Jos to meet house owner. It is unclear to us if Tony Elumelu’s family and the man’s family is connected. Because I am still surprised how these people followed me from all angles; the constant damage they did to our lives is so huge. Fred Ajudua::: 419 kingpin::: is in prison::: but his brothers and sisters continue to execute his jobs (enemies of the people). Fighting corruption is tracing and punishing the sins (fraud) of the past. As it always be::: every serious crime must leave a loophole.

In 1977::: Jay Brewer joined the Aggie Band as a cadet and he never left. Col.

This is his story.  Thank you::: Col. Brewer.,2020-12-21 01:13:21,I have known Jay for several years and had the honor of working with him as the first-ever Cadet Training Officer for the Band starting in the Fall of 1999 (Bonfire tragedy).

The Aggies will face off against the Tar Heels in the Orange Bowl! BTHO UNC!  Texas A&M Football with Texas Farm Bureau. Paid Partnership ·  The Aggies are headed to the Orange Bowl!  #BTHOunc | #GigEm,2020-12-20 19:41:33,I'm a Gator fan and A&M should be there instead of ND. It could be ND and Clemson again (fat chance) And who wants to see ND and Clemson play again?,I believe if A&M was in Norte Dames position (3rd) and we lost as bad as ND did::: we would of dropped to around 10. No 3 spot to 4. No respect,This Notre Dame fan believes you should be in the playoff. Sorry about the snub::: y'all...we shouldn't be there.,Joke::: should have picked up a game when ole miss canceled,Just focus on this game::: prepare well::: play hard::: play your hearts out::: and BTHO of Jordan School. Beat them more than ND did. Don’t show up like Georgia or Auburn did. Use this as the year a sleeping giant awakens!,No Cotton Bowl! Dam Aggies keep getting screwed over!,A&M is not a blueblood. Bluebloods in the playoffs means higher ratings and more money. This was never about who the best teams are. ESPN launches a smear campaign against A&M and was successful. You can't fight ESPN and their money. Get used to it. It's a rigged system that no one is interested in changing.,I agree completely. Terribly unfair to our guys who have played so well this year despite all the craziness.,Just glad our team gets to go somewhere other than Jerry World !,Pathetic::: the networks pick who they want not the committee!,There's a Fn Biased against Aggies in College Football and its been there for a long time. Its all about TV ratings and North verses South the old bias is still there,Aggies got ripped,"We should be in the CFP! Yes::: we lost big to Alabama::: but Notre Dame just lost big to Clemson yesterday! AND Ohio State has played nobody! This is why college football is getting boring and more people are tuning out of it. The CFP committee is so bad and so biased::: they just pick the same teams because they're ""elite powerhouses"" over and over again because it's easy and call it a day",Not an aggie fan but they are getting screwed by 6 game ohio state and the jerk committee,A&M got ripped off,We should be in the playoffs—but we are really moving in the right direction. I’ll take it.,"Play the game you're in::: not the game you ""ought "" to play. Gig Em!",I kinda feel sorry for NC-we’ll beat the tar out of ‘em! 🤣,Playing Mack Brown. If you squint real hard::: you can pretend we’re playing Texas 20 years ago.,It was a toss up for the 4 spot but we’ll see how the Heels fare. Could make a good statement to the committee!! Gig Em!!,Ohio 6 games. 🙄,I don’t want to play the orange bowl. I want to be in Miami for the championship game.,Congratulations on your Orange Bowl victory. Our best players have decided to sit this one out so they can chase that NFL money.,Time or date set yet??,Trying to be an objective Ag here. Much as I would like to brag about getting in to the CFP::: this year there’s really Alabama and Clemson (with Lawrence) and a bunch of other teams. We would have gotten Alabama. The committee didn’t want that. We need to focus and beat NC and end up #3.,It is not a CFP game but it is a great bowl in the top tier and a chance to make a national statement. Win this one big and there is a great chance for a top 5 ranking at the start of next season. Also a chance for a Top 3 or 4 ranking in the final poll this season after Notre Dame and Ohio State get reamed by Bama and Clemson.,Still don't like it::: we were screwed!!!! OSU only in from past name and did not have same number of games played. ND::: nope and Bama will crush'em::: or hoping so. Gig'em!!!,Look at it like this: I’d take going to Miami over Jerry World any day! So I hope the team enjoys every minute of it!! Gig’em,CFP is favoritism and want money$$. I am not happy 🖕🏼at the CFP committee vote. Texas A&M should enter the playoff... It is Rigged!!,I am a horns fan and probably shouldn't comment but 10 & 1 In the SEC lost to #1 away game. Just do not understand corruption everywhere WOW,A great bowl and a terrific finish for an outstanding season! Very proud of this team.👍,EC bias wins again. OSU with 6 games? Really. Try nine in SEC. ND too. TV money wins the day. Proud of depleted Ags. Hopefully we take care of business and stomp UNC. System has to change!,Glad the Aggies got a good bowl bid::: but you got hosed! You should have been #4! Gig’em!,How can Ohio qualify with only 6 games? We played 3 more games than them. There should be a minimum to qualify.,Congratulations to Texas A&M on a good season. But let’s review the record before complaining too much about the CFP selections. A&M’s biggest win of the year was over a 3-loss Florida team and they didn’t pull away from a 3-7 Tennessee team this weekend until the 4th quarter.,Who cares. Ohio state played 6 games and barely beat their two ranked opponents. Notre dame gets absolutely destroyed by Clemson and still makes the 4th spot? They beat a Clemson team w 3 defensive starters and Trevor not playing. The system is rigged::: no questions asked,We should be playing Cincinnati or Oklahoma. Not a team with three losses.,A&M and Cincinnati were robbed!,Ohio State doesn’t deserve to be there::: didn’t play enough games.,Good luck and congrats... We knew ohio state wouldn't get shunned...but you guys are well deserving to have been 3 or 4 ...let's go take care of N carolina!,We were cheated.... it's a damn shame!!!,Be grateful::: BTHO UNC! Play the same ::: or better::: next season...no one can deny you. Lots of organizations got screwed this year ::: we made out better than most (not OSU::: obviously)::: so make the best of it::: kick some ass::: prove the pundits wrong::: and get ready. Feel sorry for the seniors::: though....,Not an A&M fan but you guys got screwed over. Ohio state shouldn't even be in consideration,Need two things: 1) Ags win by 20+ over UNC 2) ‘Bama Hangs 70 pts. around the fraud ND...,Okay::: I'm wrong. Thought 1 and 2 would be battling it out in the Rose bowl. Nope::: it's Alabama and Notre Dame. Too bad both of them can't loose.,Have to play the ACC 4th place::: 3 loss team. Total trap game. If we don’t win by 4 tds they will say we shouldn’t have been ranked 5. They couldn’t at least match us up to an opponent that finished better than 4th in their conference?,I thought we were playing Oklahoma.,"Main thing is let's get past this and focus on the game we're IN. Not the game we should be in. Long history of teams not getting into their ""deserved"" bowl and then losing a lower tier bowl. Can't have that.

For the final time this Texas A&M Football season::: watch the Fightin' Texas Aggie Band form at the north end of Kyle Field!  This halftime performance was originally performed and filmed for the home game vs. Ole Miss.,2020-12-19 19:02:34,Wish bands such as this would get more coverage/ posting. To March and make formations while playing an instrument is most difficult. Truly unique.. should definitely get more recognition!!,My husband was one of the drum majors of the Texas Aggie Band in 1964-1965 as well as our older son was a drum major 1990-1991. Our younger son was on the Bugle Rank 1992-1993. Have spent MANY enjoyable hours watching the band over the years!,We marched similar to this when I was in high school!,Excellent. Always enjoy watching the band. Best band ever.,Never gets old watching them::: always massively impressive!,Just love watching these performances. We never know exactly where our Connor is (on trumpet) but enjoy everyone and this band continues to amaze. Lots of practice. Proud of you::: Connor. Wish they'd let you all do the halftime performance so people could feel the true spirit of this wonderful school.,Awesome as always! The Patton theme is my favorite!,I am sorry I didn’t know my husband when he marched in the Aggie band. I was just 10,Always the best !! Fightin Texas Aggie Band Best in the land !!

Great music & great memories❤️our Dripping Springs high school band,Second best band in the country behind The Ohio State Band (best damn band in the land)!,Aggie's football killin it against Tennessee! Iowa??? No way,Most awesome Band ever,Greatest Band in all the land! Loved watching the fighting Aggie Band in the stands during the games since the 70’s. So different to see the stadium empty::: and the quietness of no crowd.,Outstanding college band!,When I was in high school during the last century::: we tried to imitate the Aggie Band one half time by spelling out Hello. We screwed up and put the “O” on the wrong end. 😄,As a UT fan and letterman::: orange blood::: I salute the men and women of the Aggie band for their perseverance and excellence during this Covid 2020 year. These Texas young men and women have shown as much fortitude as any football team.,Love watching the band!!!!!,We watched a video performance at the game today!,Sorry- I’m an OHIO fan. Nothing like script OHIO!,Awesome performance as always. The best band in the land! Whoop!,As a Michigan fan::: of course I believe they’re the best band! But I’ve always loved the TA&M band::: awesome fight song::: the precision marching. Always enjoy military bands & music! Hoping A&M would come to Ann Arbor for a game! Question::: the game today was at Tennessee. So does the band perform earlier in the week then rebroadcasted at Neyland stadium Or is the band preforming live at Kyle Field?,my son played tube class of ‘14,Love watching. Maybe within next two years before my grandson graduates.,They are a awesome Band!!!,Never get tired of watching this Aggie Band,Still amazing with no one in the stands! Won’t be the same without the “voice” of the band.,We got the game on the west coast and this is the icing on the cake::: gig'em,Susan Black Davis Russell...the Fighting Texas Aggie Band will need a great saxaphone player in about 6 years or so !

The Best Band in the Land❣,Gets me every.single.ti me...even after 20+ years...,They pay for their own instruments. West Point hires its band. They pay their own tuition.

A lot of hate and discontent on this thread. Something I’ve been seeing more and more from Aggies (I’m assuming). So much for those 5 core values. Never thought I would come to an Aggie site and read so much ignorance.,How about just::: “goodbye”. Of course::: patting yourself on your back is always better.,Bye,How is that the most relevant?,Let’s make a good choice for university president this time,I have not paid attention what did he do that was bad or do they just want our ex governor in place,David Oh,Frank Bernardo,How about Merry Christmas??? You dirty-scoundrel .,If I recall correctly::: A&M was already a top research facility before Young came.,Congrats sir,Merry Christmas,Just leave already. Don’t say anything else. Just leave. Worst school President ever.,Let’s make him a Conservative who hires no Marxist/ socialist teachers!,What ever happened to the racist windshield note incident? Was it ever resolved? Who won the $1200?,Can I get a Whoop. Thank God he is gone. #bringbackbowtie #bowtieloftin,Even though I work at TAMU::: and I understand that any leader is going to have critics::: I’m curious as to what the specific reasons are for the degree of hostility towards Young. What did he do to inspire such hostility?,Good riddance! Such a disgrace to the University!,Top fan Carla Gault,As you read this::: 23 miserable dogs are still warehoused in TAMU’s laboratory::: cowering in metal cages without the affection or comfort that they deserve.  Some are becoming ever more debilitated by a painful canine form of muscular dystrophy::: which they were deliberately bred to have::: and they struggle to walk::: eat::: and even breathe. Yet that doesn’t stop experimenters from stretching the dogs’ muscles with motorized levers and cutting out chunks of their muscles to examine.,So many comments on this make me know my daughter is doing the right thing leaving TAMU. What she says about it is reflected here.,Good riddance,The grown adults commenting that still haven’t learned enough about their own religion’s values to love thy neighbor really disrespects their own Jewish leader (Jesus)::: happy holidays!! -Regular Aggie Student,Do let the door hit you in the ass on the way out! Good riddance.,Good riddance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I sure hope you get a chance to meet him!,WHOOP 👍👍👍,Woah!,Can anyone please tell me about the Pate family inbox. Bonnie ::: David::: their sons Mark Thomas Pate n Drew that killed himself. I've been dating Marks wife Chandra for 5 years and my mom had to hire a PI n told me she's married. She told me 5 years ago she found him dead in a ditch hot by drunk driver. She needs me talhealth n a support network. She just told me via text 4 weeks ago Mark Thomas Pate tried to rape her with his friends in the wedding party on their wedding night. Please help. The police are negligent in Robertson County. I'm pretty sure Mark Pate is a Pygamist or Biligomist out on Walker Praire. He's a truck driver n a bad man my gf told me. Or x gf. She needs community support n real law enforcement to go do welfare check and ask the tough questions. Not::: are you safe are you ok are you in danger. No. Separate her from husband at department. I'm pressing charges for theft n suing the family. If anyone knows anything please contact me. 970 880 4290 very concerned about her safety on that property and out in public. She has told hundreds of people up here her name is Moon. Her father is in board for BP in London n she owns beaches n blah blah blah. I thought head injury from her car wreck n I've been so patient. But I just see she took my ice shanty n auger n fishing tackle. She lives on a lake in Texas. It's her illness that did this to me n my family. Not her. I forgive her I did snap one night after 5 years of this n she won't contact me. We were getting married after her divorce. It was all a lie. Im taking them on in Civil court. Hired Hindshaw n Culbertson. They are going to try as well.,Jana Tubbs McMillan Eli would make one heck of an Aggie!!,Nicole Lara,Good Bull 👍🏼,great program,I wonder if they’re able to attend class in person with the Covid restrictions?,This made me the proudest Aggie EVER!!

Texas A&M will require all employees and on-campus residents to be tested for COVID-19 at the start of the spring semester.  All students who live off campus and attend in-person classes or visit campus are also encouraged to be tested: tx.ag/UpdateDec20,2020-12-15 00:13:24,How does that work? Are yall going to test everyone everyday? You can test negative and them come into contact with it the next day.,And the hysteria rolls on...,Soon the vaccination will be a requirement in order to attend.,YesI realize that-I am a nurse and my unit has had over 120 patients w covid. What a test does is give a result::: has the person isolate and protect others.,Oh A&M-you used to be so conservative and upstanding. So sorry you drank the Koop-Aid.,Puzzling... my nurse daughter had Covid::: her husband with no symptoms went to get tested. Doctor said he didn’t need to test if he had no symptoms - it was a waste of resources and perpetuates the fear of a virus that 99 plus % survive.,Thank you A&M for being proactive!,Sounds like those that refuse to comply by getting tested and vaccinated for whatever reason will be part of the inevitable “thinning of the herd” so to speak. Only those that choose to oblige with personal & community safety measures ( i.e. seat belts::: traffic lights) to ensure a healthier future will survive! Survival of the fittest as they say! Personal choices::: made at the exclusion of society as a whole::: may not necessarily have a positive outcome in the case of COVID.,This is a violation of privacy! What!? Are people serious? This is killing people fast because it’s spreading fast::: and when you have a bunch of kids going to school together what do you think will happen. My god::: people are dense. Why aren’t people dying or why don’t we see many cases of the measles or Hib::: because of vaccines! Wtf?,You guys have no idea. We live in downstate New York which was ground zero for deaths early on. Even if 97% recover they sometimes have serious long lasting complications and of course the loss of life. It is a simple request. Be for the human race ....,Or... wash your hands::: sanitize surfaces::: and continue to operate within your bubble. Get tested if you are exposed or show symptoms. You can’t make a 40:::000 people bubble.,Some of y'all failed your science classes and it shows,Seems crazy to me. For a virus that 99.9% of people survive and college aged kids recover nicely from this virus.,If this such a dire thing to do why is it not starting till spring. Good Lord.,They do realize a negative test result does not mean they won’t get it later that day right? This prevents nothing.,Unless you have a student at A&M hush! We are glad this policy is in place. We pay tuition,I applaud their efforts to protect their students and staff. It shows once again what an upstanding higher education facility that they are.  I’m sorry that others on here only care about their own personal opinions. I’m sorry for their family and friends because you won’t be there when they need you!,So tired of this debate! If there’s any chance::: however small::: testing and masks help::: let’s just do it.,As an Aggie supporter:::but not an Aggie:::this has got to be one of the stupidest things I have ever heard of!So you get a test:::test negative:::and 30 minutes later you run to the Post Oak Mall or Northgate and get it.You've accomplished what?,Y’all are not ready for this conversation. Neither is Texas A&M,Who the hell are you to try and protect our staff and students?  Very. Upset.,"Are the ""non-essentials "" still working from home as they are at the Health Science Center? Must be nice to stay at home for 10 months and get paid while the ""essential workers"" take up your slack.",If a student chooses not to be tested can they get a refund on their on campus housing? Does anyone know if the housing contract has a clause stating that a student has to submit to Covid testing if asked to do so?,This is the exact problem the fear propaganda has created. We now live in a world where by default we assume you are sick until proven otherwise...  Imagine if we acted that way for every other known disease,It’s a good thing none of the students have been hanging out and partying together throughout the entire pandemic...🙊 I wonder if an extra “covid fee” will be added to tuitions to cover the testing?,Thank goodness! Other Universities have already been doing this. This is past due.,This is bad bull! This is a terrible infringement of the rights and health privacy of the thousands on campus when you have thousands of other remote students visiting every day that will not be subject to the same. Let Aggies live their lives! Are you going to give breathalyzers and STD tests next?,These comments make me sick to be an aggie. Imagine being this upset that people are being tested for a disease during a pandemic.,Sooo glad my child is no longer there.,Ridiculous. Why didn’t they do this for the flu all these years?,Soon we will all have to have::: on our person::: proof of it. So why is requiring a valid ID bad::: but this is good?,It's free::: it doesn't hurt to spit in a tube::: and the whole process takes less than 5 minutes. Results come back quick. Yall need to chill,Other schools in the system need to do the same. We have to be proactive! Students should be able to have the same on-campus learning experience I did::: and that requires us to create a safe environment for students and professors.,So if the anyone was positive less than 3 months::: they will still show up positive. What are they doing about that ? An antibody test I suppose?,The test is worthless! Don't be stupid just because a lot of other people are. The accuracy of the test is around 30% and only good for the time before they walk away. Ridiculous and not needed. I'm ashamed of my alma mater for this.,I’ve listened to everyone talk on this forum and it makes absolutely no sense at all::: except for one individual who said… You can get tested today and be negative::: and be exposed tomorrow::: so why go to all the trouble and expense to be tested? If you don’t feel well get tested::: otherwise Leave it alone. Aggie Mom from 2017,This is really unnecessary as a vaccine is being distributed as we speak and classes don't resume until January...,So::: get tested..even without symptoms? Is A&M paying for it?,Socialism at it finest,Well it was supposed to be mandatory way back in August but it wasn't so guess what 1100+ i feel it should be mandatory,Why? Complete waste of time::: money::: and resources. We don’t need any more Aggie jokes!!,They do it to help mitigate litigation,Feel like this should’ve been done in the Fall::: but I’m glad it’s at least happening now.,"Yea no I rather not get tested::: but thanks no thanks I don't see any reason too. If vaccines become mandatory then it is an even bigger no for me. As they say now a days "" My body.. My choice"". Bad enough you get all my money so if you want my health record go speak to my doctors if you want to know everything. Simple as that.👍",Just completely stupid. Test one day be negative and get it the next day. If you don’t have symptoms don’t get tested.,This helps a little but unfortunately you can still get COVID after testing negative. Luckily young people recover quickly.,I am just curious as to why off camp students don't have to test. Those students like probably come in contact with the on campus one.,I seriously doubt they’re going to make the vaccinations mandatory. Testing is one thing::: but the vaccination should NEVER BE REQUIRED.,Schreiner tested all students at move in::: and will be testing them all again as they return for Spring Semester. Testing us great::: but agree you can test negative one day and be exposed and or positive the next. Evey little bit helps::: but I would not agree with mandatory vaccine before returning in the Spring.,Thanks for working hard to keep our kids and all of the teachers & staff safe.,Love this!! Yes::: we need to take care of ourselves and others!! Need to test and do better contact tracing as well!!! Exactly what countries such as NZ and Australia have done to manage this pandemic!!! It is not a matter of fear or human rights... it is plain control of a pandemic. This should be done nationwide!!!,From a school that has such a great science program::: this is embarrassing! Crack a book! https:// youtu.be/ OoeCB0MudgA,I don’t. Huge overstep. Texas A&M isn’t what it used to be.....,So you get tested days before and that proves you're negative until you walk out the door.... This sounds like an Aggie joke. Just let them go to class!!,Ridiculous!! If I had a student there another educational decision would be made. Makes me sad,I wonder if there is any actual data as to numbers of students who actually tested positive then recovered? I’m curious to know.,How often are these people going to be tested? Cuz one-and-done is just a smoke screen.,Yea!!! And all students need to be tested too as they are as likely to engage in holiday visits and activities as anyone else.,Glad my kid has an internship away from campus for spring. My former student dollars will for sure not be going to the university once again. 😳🤷🏼‍♀️,I’d rather test the incoming class for antibodies to show how many have already had it.,Are they supposed to be tested before or after being unknowingly exposed to someone with the Kung Flu? Also::: how is this legal under HIPAA laws?,UW Madison is requiring all students to put an app on ther phone that tracks their every move::: get tested TWICE a week and be clean before they enter ANY building on campus.,Tested once? Fine. Require me to get a vaccine? I don’t think so.,How are they going to make it mandatory? They can't even enforce the tobacco free campus that is supposed to be in place.,Tested for a sickness that already has a +99% survival rate even if you catch it? What is next? Load certain people on trains and tell them it’s for their safety?,I expect some uni’s will require you to have a vaccine. Than what.,Can anyone explain to me how testing at beginning of semester does anything to prevent COVID from getting on campus,Students should be allowed out of housing contracts. This is a bait and switch mid year. Students are locked in::: univ getting money::: and now new “rule”.,Mine is and they can’t legally do this...,Wonder if the Curative saliva tests on campus would count as our required tests or is it only the nasal swab?,Will they also be testing for AIDS? If it saves just one life...,Tested once::: then what? Who pays for it?,Bahahaha WOW! This is only the beginning. Next it’ll be a mandatory vaccine. Just remember::: A&M gave money to the Wuhan lab.,As an employer they have the right to require testing and even vaccinations. As an employee of paying students they have no rights to demand anything but what the law requires. Unless there is a specific clause in the student handbook that the student acknowledged and signed dealing with this specific issue the school has NO rights.,So much for the Aggie honor code of respect and selfless service. They ask you to get a Covid test so you don’t willingly infect students and you’re all whining about it. Such a poor display of misinformation from an otherwise (formerly) educated flock.,Gilbert your going back to college and finally try to be an Aggie?,Hurray President Trump! Please keep fighting the globalists who have robbed us of everything. Texas A&M university::: COVID is a scamdemic::: please don’t waste our time with it. I remember when Texas said to the Federal Government::: keep your money::: we Texans will run our prisons the way we want::: do the same with A&M::: focus on real education and tell the Fed to stop bribing states with fake Fed Reserve Notes. Our country has been robbed!,So they give a window for employees but not students? Just on or before 22 January for students 🤷‍♀️,You need to reverse course on this decision. You are not going to have happy donors,Students have medical privacy rights! This is intrusion into personal medical information! What is next the flu? hiv? stds? Can students get out of their housing contracts?,No. We won’t be doing that.,no its not bull its to keep people healthy,Well done!!! Thanks for trying to work and keep faculty staff and students safe.,I hope Galveston campus is doing this too!,Now is the time to get some rental property in BCS.,Great idea. Gotta get it under control,Thanks for setting the example for the state. In case some of you anti vax-ers don’t know - the meningitis vaccine has been required for incoming freshman for years.  In a similar vein::: A&M employees who smoke and do not get annual physicals - pay a smokers premium and higher med insurance rates.  Keep in mind::: your ‘freedom’ should not endanger another person’s life or impact their livelihood.,There has been an awful lot of deaths in the US since this started!!!!,Way to go! Thank you A&M!!!,Line up like good little soldiers and do what you're told.,"What are they going to do test each student daily....this campus is living up to the ""dumb"" reputation...so sad",I thought OU stunk::: y'all just proved me wrong!,Soon it will be everyone! 😡,Not cool at all.,This comment section is about as big a dumpster fire as I expected.,A&M has turned commie too! Wow!!!,Every day?,And so it begins...,Wow! Cuz! You opened up a really debatable subject! LOL!,$200 per test. Who pays? YOU DO !!,No test can be mandatory,You can not require this!!!!!!!,"To what end::: exactly? Test positive and you are banned from campus? Sounds like being ostracized. Then::: where does it end? It could start with Covid-19::: but then what? Because this ""disease passport"" idea could get well out of hand very quickly::: particularly if we stand by and ALLOW this to take place because we think that we are somehow making ourselves safer::: which we wouldn't be. Ignorant.",Rectal swab?,Will have to reschedule....,Unfortunately we live in this together. Vaccines are not required just yet::: but soon we won't be able to study::: fly or get a job without them. Let's end this pandemic quick with helping each other.🙏,the vitriol::: hatred::: lack of compassion for your fellow humans and the ignorance to basic science runs strong in these comments,This matter really liberal or conservative. It’s just public health experts doing their jobs and idiots acting like it’s more political than that,Will A&M cover the cost of these tests for students to do so? I pay $125 for a test and that’s without a visit fee. How about you offer that for free if you want it required.,Yay::: more draconian measures!,No idea if this will be seen::: but I’m seeing way too many “But what’s the point? The test could be negative::: then you’re exposed to someone with it 30 minutes later!” comments.  The point is to try to stop YOU from spreading it to several other people *before* you have a chance.  Let’s say 40:::000 students are coming back to campus (I’m not even including staff and faculty in this example). If 2:::000 of them are carriers::: but they all get tested before they step onto campus and into their classes where there are potentially hundreds of other students::: you’ve just saved yourself a massive outbreak.  Sure::: this won’t catch *all* of the cases::: and there are so many other ways to catch it later (maybe later in the semester someone goes home on a weekend to Houston::: or somewhere::: catches it again::: and brings it back::: for example)::: but the idea is to try and stem a super spreader event by catching at least the majority of positive cases.  Wouldn’t it suck to *not* do this::: and then A&M has a mega outbreak within 3-4 weeks of the semester starting::: and they have to shut down all over again?  No::: it’s not perfect::: but this is a good compromise for those who want to return to campus::: AND the need to prevent a major outbreak.  The only outcome that seems acceptable to so many of you is that A&M just pretend like nothing is happening and carry on with business as usual::: but they don’t have the luxury of putting their faculty and staff at risk like that. How would that attitude be fair to the essential worker making minimum wage by mopping academic building floors and surrounded by students all day::: who can’t miss a day of work by being sick with COVID::: or else they can’t afford rent and groceries for their family?  The university isn’t just the students—they have thousands of people to consider::: and doing things like making tests and masks mandatory::: while still allowing the campus to open up::: is their compromise.,First::: we really don’t know much about these brand new vaccines and their side effects and effectiveness. Secondly::: people who just had covid and recovered should now have their own (better) natural immunity and should not be required to also get the vaccination shots. Finally::: it’s solid scientific data that college student typical age groups without covid comorbidity conditions are very unlikely to catch::: transmit::: or suffer from covid. WHY are we mandating vaccinations for a flu-like illness with a 95-99%+ recovery rate::: that is often so asymptomatic or mild that infected people don’t even feel sick? Unlike normal seasonal flus which are miserable::: highly contagious::: and kill thousands every year of all ages. And unpredictably; we don’t have a list of very specific flu comorbidities that I’ve seen. I am class of ‘80 and I’m 62. I am the exact same slim trim size I was at TAMU. I am healthy. I never get a flu shot and I’ve only had the flu once::: over 3 decades ago::: despite teaching around germy kids for 36 years. I have no intention of getting a covid vaccination. Logic says that I clearly have a great strong natural immune system. Why would I tamper with it? Also::: statistically::: if millions of people already had covid (many unknowingly and untested)::: and millions more think they must be vaccinated::: well- there won’t be very many people left to be a concern about spreading covid. Also- very important covid data no one talks about: Being overweight greatly increases covid hospitalization s and deaths. Existing vaccinations have had decreased effectiveness on fat people. And America is the fattest nation on Earth! So::: those people will still be unhealthy and high risks unless they choose to lose their excess weight. Age doesn’t matter either; younger people who’ve died from covid were usually unhealthy with covid comorbidities: obesity::: hypertension::: diabetes::: heart disease::: or lung disease. Most covid deaths globally were very unhealthy people with multiple preexisting conditions. We knew these stats from all the deaths early on in Italy. Unfortunately::: in Italy the average age of those early deaths was about 80. So yes::: our elderly citizens are at high risk::: sadly. They usually have many existing ailments and a weakened immune system. If you are too chubby or know people who are::: you should all lose weight; you are at high risk for severe covid complications. Look it up. It’s all there. CDC has good research data on Obesity and Covid. There are many good scientific and medical articles out there. Good luck::: everyone. Gig Em 👍🏻,Colossal waste of money to test students. Mortality in under 24 age group is lowest of any demographic.  Keep slowing down herd immunity and we'll see yall in 2025 doing the exact same nonsense.,What the heck! Your freedom to choose was just TAKEN and you are not going to do a darn thing about. Let me tell you what you are. Well::: the nicest thing I can say in public is a pansie. You are a disgrace to this entire country if you don't get pissed about this and fight back and say heck no::: I'm not doing it. It all boils down to money. No students attending=no money.

LSU’s were worse. It was bad::: hard to watch football::: with the exception of our defense. But it’s still a win.,That was a real blowout. Whoop!,Whoop!,Good game Ags!

A win in the rain at Kyle Field for Texas A&M Football tonight as they defeat the LSU Tigers 20-7! Whoop!,2020-11-29 04:01:30,Make sure the refs are paid good,Our son leaves the room when the Aggies play @ Kyle Field. He thinks he's a jinx to the football 🏈 team. He comes back 'cause he knows they are winning! Hooray!!,Solid D! Good job Aggies!,Hey it's rain. Get a life::: we won,Looked a little rusty::: but in the end it was a win!! 👍🏻,11/34 105 yards. Pure garbage like he usually is,Wasn’t pretty but we’ll take it. 👍🏼,Ok let’s look at reality here. Bama is going to win the SEC and probably be the #1 seed. Best case senecio is make playoffs at 4 seed. Do you honestly think this team stands a chance to compete with a #1 seed?,Auburn scored 48 on LSU.,If A&M don't stay at #5::: it can be directed straight to Mond and the receivers. They were absolutely horrible. Mond is supposed to be the team leader::: he sucked::: some downs he had over 10 sec to complete a pass::: and he still could not get the job done. Disgraceful!,Any time we beat LSU it's a good win! We had a long layoff and rainy weather and for one reason or another we didn't play our best::: but still won. That's a good thing. Gig Em!,Jennifer Smith,Yeah. Really.,Love my Aggies and love the win .... game looked blah::: thank goodness LSU was worse,Defense was awesome but play calling after 20 point lead is not going to get them in the playoffs. Jimbo needs killer instinct like Saban. Don't let up.,In case you didn’t know...  “Number 0 is now wearing number 19” 😂,Was not pretty but it was a win!!!👍,Not good. Mond played poorly. Ags didn’t cover the spread,Mond Blows. Max Johnson had better numbers::: L$U benched their starter with comparable completions to Mond. #StartKing,Worst tv commentators ever!,I'll take it. Elite teams sometimes play poorly and find a way to not only win but dominate. We did that today. LSU was never really in the ballgame.,Just awful play from the offense. (assuming that was the offense on the field). Still can't stand the overrated Kellen Mond.  Thank God the 'Wrecking Crew' is back.,We assure you of the grade you are looking for.#essays #online courses #research papers # quizzes # Proofreading and editing Dm WeChat ID:essaypro2015 Whatsapp: +12053169226 Email:classhelp 37@gmail.com,Ugly win but defense was awesome,We took the W but Mond was absolutely terrible,A classic show of playing down to your competition.its the coaches job to make sure they are mentally prepared after a two week break.gig em,If Brennan would have played we would have one!,That was probably the worst college football game I have ever seen... totally out of sync due to long layoff. Both teams! But glad we won!,Go aggies!!! 💪🏻👏🏼👏🏼,Gig em Ags! Great broadcast!!! Great win!!!,They better get focused on Auburn next week. That will be their most important game of this season.,👍👍👍,Thank goodness the defense showed up. Pitiful offense.,I’ll take that win! Would like to see any of you trash-talking::: naysayers do better! Aggies support Aggies. 👍🏼,Solid Defensive but saw a lot of dropped passes that could have been caught. At least we won and now let’s focus on our next game vs Auburn Tigers.,Mond played probably his worst game. The team is in need of style points to pad their resume and people are really mad at the commentators because they kept pointing that out? IF this is a playoff team we will be critiqued far more harsher down the road. Be glad we're not Varsity. #gigem,A win’s a win. Gig’em Ags 👍🏼,Seriously bad offense. Top 3 defense. Yet::: ESPN has contracts to think of.,Two weeks of not playing showed. Rusty.,Offense was horrible we are lucky to get the win and I wouldn't be surprised if Florida jumps us in the polls,Whoop!,Always fun to see the fans tell the coaches and players how to do it . God help us if they were in control!,Way to go Aggies! Gig’em!,I’ll take the win... defense great! Offense looked like it hadn’t played for three weeks.... Auburn will be much tougher than LSU... let’s go Ags! Gig’em!,Some of the dropped passes I can attribute to the weather. That said::: there were far too many that Mond missed terribly. And::: our vaunted offensive line couldn't get their blocking schemes adjusted::: thereby rendering our running game virtually ineffective. A win::: yes. A win that will be noticed in a positive way by the selection committee::: no.,Mond is graduating this year right????,Not the best game - Aggies are much better than they looked - it’s a win and we’ll take it - let’s move on and focus on the next game! Gig ‘em! Whoop! 👍,Yes. They were terrible. Don’t even think they were aware that it was pouring during the game!!,Offense plays like that again we are done for.....,😢,Great win Ags!,Go AGGIES 🏈🏈🏈,Whoop,Whoop!,Congratulations Aggies on you win !!,Agreed,👍,Whoop!,👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍,Look Jennifer Cavazos-Andrews on::: the Aggies won for your birthday. 🥳❤️👍🏼 Gig’em lol,Whoop! 👍🏼,Whoop whoop!!!,Whoop!!!,Great game,👍🏻Whoop👍🏻,Gigem Aggies,Whoop!,Whoop!!!,Jessica Vasquez 👍🏻,Thank god for the defense,Whoop,A weird game,Whoop!!,Was a great win.,Whoop👍🏻,BFD.,👍,Whoop!,Whoop!,Whoop! 👍🏻,👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻,Martha Ciacciofera,AGGIES #1,Whoop!,Chey Bouillion!! 😉,WHOOP!

Brewer::: for your service to our country and to Texas A&M.,It will never be the same without his voice! Thank you Col Brewer! ‘86,Judy Brewer::: please share this with Jay. Echoing what Eric Brown said::: Col. Jay O. Brewer has been a part of the Aggie Band and Texas A&M for 44 of the band’s 126 years. Putting that into perspective:  - every band class from the Class of ‘78 to the Class of ‘24 has known a fish Brewer::: Mr. Brewer::: Sir!::: Jay::: 2LT/1LT/CAPT/ MAJ/LTC/COL Brewer  - when Col. Brewer entered as fish Brewer it was the beginning of Joe T. Haney’s fifth year as Aggie Band director. When Jay Brewer graduated in 1981::: Joe Haney asked him to stay on and help run the Aggie Band  - Haney had briefly attended A&M and marched in the Aggie Band under Col. E. V. Adams before being drafted into the Army. He later studied music at SMU and built the Mexia High School band program before being personally selected by Col. Adams as his replacement in 1973. Col. Haney wrote the Aggie Band’s signature March::: “Noble Men of Kyle”. Col. Haney also taught private lessons to a young Ray Toler during summer visits back home in Marlin::: TX. Toler grew up to be an Air Force band director and was Col. Haney’s personal choice to replace him in 1989.  - LTC E. V. Adams ‘29 was the longest-serving director of the Aggie Band from 1946-1973. It was LTC Adams that created many of the signature drill designs that the Aggie Band is known for today. While a student::: Adams was told by his director::: Col. Richard. J. Dunn::: that he should keep studying music because Dunn wanted Adams to come back some day and take over as Aggie Band director. While growing up in College Station::: Adams was also taught how to play the trumpet by Alois Slovacek::: another former Aggie bandmaster  - Col. Richard J. Dunn was Aggie Band director from 1924-1946. He introduced many traditions including the Block T::: the bugle rank::: and wrote the music for “The Spirit of Aggieland. Col. Dunn was a veteran of the Spanish American War::: studied at the Grand Conservatory in NYC::: and was offered a position in John Philip Sousa’s Marine Band but declined it for his desire to be an Army bandmaster::: a goal he achieved in 1911 when he became Bandmaster of the U. S. 11th Infantry Band. It was under Col. Dunn that the Aggie Band first became “nationally famous”  In summary::: Col. Jay Brewer has served the Aggie Band longer than any other staff member ever. His career spans the terms of three Aggie band directors and connects in an unbroken line all the way back to Col. Richard Dunn in 1924. Upon his retirement::: it will be the first time since 1946 that a former member of the Aggie Band hasn’t been on band staff. Besides being the “Voice of the Aggie Band” since 1981::: he has been involved in rehearsals::: directing::: administrative duties::: instrument repair::: counseling cadets::: and contributing to the history and lore of the Fightin’ Texas Aggie Band. He will certainly be missed by generations of Aggies but he won’t be forgotten. Even today::: there are current Aggie Band members who are the children of former band members who marched while Col. Brewer was on staff. Years from now::: their children will also join the Aggie Band and hear stories from their parents about Col. Brewer.  Gig ‘em!

A message from Dr. John Junkins on being named Interim President of Texas A&M University beginning January 1::: 2021: tx.ag/InterimJunkins,2020-11-24 21:28:12,How about releasing ALL the dogs that have been abused for YEARs in the muscular dystrophy lab with no results?! I will never ever understand how teachers teach here and STUDENTS go here knowing these beautiful dogs have been intentionally given Muscular Dystrophy and they sit and rot in this lab 😡,I may be out of the loop but I thought Young was stepping down in May.,Congratulations Dr Junkins!!! I’m so excited that one of my past professors is the interim President. Best wishes!,Will be praying for you and your ability to lead the greatest university on the face of the earth!!,Welcome to the best and hardest position in College Station. Thank you for being our new leader. Class 57.,Wonderful news! Congratulations Dr. Junkins.,Don't touch Sully,Congratulations !!,Amanda Taliercio,👍 Congratulations Dr Junkins.,please keep the core TAMU values rather than adopt the cancerous culture of pc::: marxism::: wokeness::: identity division::: and victimhood. gigem!,I am asking this in the most respectful way possible and I'm not looking for a debate. I was not overly impressed by the stances or at times the direction that the current President has lead TAMU. For those of you who are more familiar with Dr. Junkins::: how would you say he compares or rather what are your expectations?,Congratulations . Please protect our precious university from political correctness and intolerance.,Welcome! Hopefully you’re first directive is to free the dogs in the lab. Free cannoli and the other dogs in the lab. You offered him up for adoption but then shipped phim to another lab. He deserves a chance to be surrounded by people who love him and will not torture him .

Now selection committee: don't repeat your mistake.,So who will be at the make up 2020 graduation giving the speech?,I'll give Dr. Young some credit. When I walked across the stage on graduation day he was the only person on that stage who recognized my Veterans Cords. He took time to thank me for serving and asked where I served. That meant a lot too me 🇺🇲,How about our Former Texas Governor and Texas Aggie Rick Perry?!?!,Let’s make the best of this opportunity and change the direction from where was taking us. Hopefully we will learn from our previous mistakes!,25000 at Kyle field::: but no 2020 Spring or Summer graduation. Those kids deserved to walk across the stage::: not have their names flashed on a jumbo-tron::: and that’s it. Something our family will never forget.,As a proud Texas Aggie::: I thank you for propelling A&M into a more diverse::: equitable::: and inclusive community!,Good day for Aggieland!,Thanks for your leadership.

Bring back Loftin!,Bring back Loftin!!!,Worst president ever. Get someone who actually went to A&M and respects our traditions!,Hit the road::: Jack!,What leadership?,I’ll always remember my first Midnight Yell in ‘15. He called us the “Texas Fightin’ Aggies” and things never got better.,From the guy who considered removing Sully...,The BEST president A&M has had recently was Robert Michael Gates (2002-2006). He left when G.W.B. called him as Defense Secretary::: which he did from 2006 to 2011. He's now Chancellor of the College of William and Mary since 2012. That is good 8 years. I wonder if we'd be interested. He is a man worth bringing back!!! Here's his address at the Aggie Muster ceremony at Reed Arena in 2009::: his last time at Aggieland https:// www.youtube.com/ watch?v=hgkUXs9X axU,Bring back the bowtie!,Boy::: so many of you would have hated Rudder for allowing women on campus. 😆,Don’t let the door hit you in the ass,Didnt he announce that a fee months ago?,AN AGGIE NEEDS TO BE THE PRESIDENT,Now bring back tradition and the conservative values that aTm used to have.,Great day for Aggies. See ya!,"""BYE FELICIA!""  So glad to see this idiot liberal leave. TAMU needs a real leader (preferably an Aggie) that will uphold & preserve it's conservative traditions & values. All the other anti-American liberal teachers also need to leave with him. Need to be more selective on student admissions as well.",Bring back Loftin!,Free cannoli and the other dogs in the lab.

Lol.,Bring a former student as president who takes us back to what it means to be a Texas Aggie. I miss Aggies being different than every other university. It was great to stand out for the right reasons.,Best news I’ve heard all day. I suggest leaving for another school that better aligns with your beliefs rather than changing ours. There are plenty out there to choose from. Make A&M Great Again!,Maybe this position at the Bush school will be in a windowless office with him writing a blog he thinks is real but goes nowhere.

Give the gift of freedom to the dogs you are experimenting on.,50 ways to swindle former students... the university president gets paid 1 million and look how bad he's handling the covid crisis on campus.,Right now::: 24 dogs—at least 12 of whom are perfectly healthy::: adoptable::: and without disease symptoms—are still being warehoused in Texas A&M University's canine muscular dystrophy (MD) laboratory::: despite the retirement of lead experimenter Joe Kornegay and the lack of funding for new experiments.  The golden retrievers and other dogs in the laboratory are deprived of the very things that make their life worth living::: as they spend every day stuck in barren metal cells. The dogs suffering from canine MD have undergone painful and terrifying testing::: and their health has steadily deteriorated to the point where it's difficult for them even to swallow their own saliva. Video footage shows that the healthy ones pace frantically and bite at the bars of their cages in frustration.  It's commendable that Texas A&M made the compassionate decision to stop breeding dogs to develop MD in 2019. Please do the next right thing and use your authority as a regent to order the release of the surviving dogs from the MD laboratory so that they may live the remaining years of their lives in warm::: loving adoptive homes.  Thank you for your consideration of this important matter.  Sincerely,In the spirit of giving free the dogs. Free cannoli and the other dogs in the lab.

COVID-19 protocols on campus are being adjusted this week after a rise in cases at Texas A&M.  Read more about the new on-campus restrictions: tx.ag/COVIDUpdateNov9,2020-11-09 23:45:24,Contact tracing showing the source being off-campus social activities.. perhaps the university needs to safely address the social needs of the student body on campus.,🙏🏻🙏🏻,There’s a vaccine. Go get it.,What is the name of your doctor?,Considering how much this has affected the students please bring back the pass/fail you did last semester. Too much on these kids plates!,It doesn't impact the students at all.,Lisa Karr,STOP IN PERSON FOOTBALL GAMES! Players and coaches only.,JD Spence,This is what happens when you give a platform to misinformation and disinformation. You bragged about being listed as a top campus for free speech. Well::: here is what happens when disinformation is given a platform. No one has to shut down free speech. Equally::: misinformation and disinformation don't deserve a platform.  Fightin' Texas Aggie class of 1996. Whoop!,I will say that I'm currently bateltling Covid. I haven't lived in fear or thought it was real but cautious. I have a daughter at A&M which this has been a little worry on this year. We prepared her to be cautious and use common sense. But I will say upon getting COVID last week I made sure to let her know and remember her more to take care of herself and follow the guidelines. I wouldnt wish this one any one.,Any comments from anyone who never goes to campus or even knows a student are merely baiting. If you have a student::: or two in my case::: it's important to have the information since it's possible a loved one::: say a mom::: could have heart issues among many other::: and be at risk of being dead after the holidays. You insensitive and political debating idiots can troll elsewhere. Aggies are family and family takes care of each other. If you want to debate on the subject::: we can do so off campus::: I'll bring a few thousand friends you can talk to as well. Gig 'em,"I love reading the dumb comments that are left on every TAMU COVID update. TAMU goes out of their way to protect their staff and students and every time they get slammed on facebook for ""low death rates"" or ""its fake"" or ""the hospitals arent at capacity"" which all are bad arguments.  I feel so bad for whoever runs TAMU social media::: because the 'aggie family' that shows up in these threads are all the weird uncles who get too close when they talk and cant stay out of jail for more than a year",No one cares!!!!!!! Get on with life!!!!!!,😥😥😮😮,Roxanne Calderon,Let them play.. and open up the school..,It’s all a play... i work for a doctor and the other day we were trying to get a patient into Houston Methodist. We couldn’t get him in bc they were “reserving beds for Covid patients”. However::: there were only TWO patients in the hospital that were covid. 🙄The hospitals aren’t full with covid patients and death rates are WAY down. Cases are up::: but that’s bc It’s moving through the population (which is normal and good) and people keep testing (which is often unnecessary),Becky Ray,Jordan Morris,Please dear God bless and protect all of them sending prayers to all who have it,No symptoms::: no test.,Selene Alaffa😕,Stacy Adams Guerra,I care. If you don’t want to know what is going at TA&M then find another page to follow. Covid is real and it’s here. I want to know.,Oh no. They're gonna get sick and have a 99.7% chance of barely having issues. Oh the over hyped humanity,Savana Maria Green,Accumulate wealth directly at home.

Whoop! Texas A&M Football gets the win on the road tonight in South Carolina!  Texas A&M Football November 7::: 2020 at 9:12 PM ·  You love to see it!  Brookshire Brothers | #GigEm,2020-11-08 03:14:14,WHOOP!!!!! Very Good game. Gig'em!!!!!,"@MUSCHAMP REMEMBER WHEN YOU CAME TO A&M AND WAS SUCH A DICK SAYING ""NOTHING GIVES ME MORE PLEASURE THAN SEEING THE DISAPPOINTMENT ON THE FANS FACES"". YOU ONLY BEAT THE HEISMAN WINNER BY LESS THAN A TOUCHDOWN. I HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN. A&M HASN'T FORGOTTEN. LOVE 48-3 . EAT IT!!!  https:// youtu.be/ OXOi9zmkx6I",When we gonna talk about the big Defensive End turned TE with the 40 something yard TD catch! Big max makin moves out there,SC hasn't scored a TD on TAMU since 2018 34-17 average score all time 7-0,There is no coach I like to see lose more than Will Muschamp. In A&M’s first game in the SEC::: Florida (coached my Muschamp) outscored A&M at Kyle Field in a hard fought and close game. At the conclusion of the game::: Muschamp was interviewed on air. He had an opportunity to make a classy statement about how great the atmosphere was at Kyle Field::: and what a great game had been played. But::: he did not. Instead::: he made a tacky::: classless comment about how happy he was to disappoint the home team’s fans by beating the Aggies.  Karma is a bitch. I hope all of Muschamp’s games go the way tonight’s game has gone.  Sorry SC...my advice::: fire your coach.,That ain't just a win::: that's a mockery. Sheesh 😬,All Aggies tonight after 100 years of pent up and unmet football program expectations. 😂 #GigEm,Incredible game!!,Wow! I think I left restaurant where they were playing this game and Aggies were winning 14-0::: wow::: wow::: wow!!! Awesome win!!! 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻,So glad to finally see us perform the way we should.

Whoop! Texas A&M Football wins in Mississippi!,2020-10-17 17:11:00,Game wasn’t near as close as the score would indicate.,We looked like crap but I'll take the win.,WHOOP,Right now::: 25 dogs—at least 12 of whom are perfectly healthy::: adoptable::: and without disease symptoms—are still being warehoused in Texas A&M University's canine muscular dystrophy (MD) laboratory::: despite the retirement of lead experimenter Joe Kornegay and the lack of funding for new experiments.  The golden retrievers and other dogs in the laboratory are deprived of the very things that make their life worth living::: as they spend every day stuck in barren metal cells. The dogs suffering from canine MD have undergone painful and terrifying testing::: and their health has steadily deteriorated to the point where it's difficult for them even to swallow their own saliva. Video footage shows that the healthy ones pace frantically and bite at the bars of their cages in frustration.  It's commendable that Texas A&M made the compassionate decision to stop breeding dogs to develop MD in 2019. Please do the next right thing and use your authority as a regent to order the release of the surviving dogs from the MD laboratory so that they may live the remaining years of their lives in warm::: loving adoptive homes.  Thank you for your consideration of this important matter.,Free 25 dogs suffering in its cruel muscular dystrophy lab.,Love those Aggies young and old!,Whoop Gigem AGGIES👍🏻,Whoop!,Offense needs to meet the caliber of the defense...too inconsistent... .good win though!,Way to go Aggies!!,WHOOP GIGEM AGGIES,I agree with you Mary Lynn Payne!

There are many people who want A&M to remain “conservative” but what I fear they really mean is for the university to hang on to those vestiges of racism and intolerance of others who are not white good ol’ boys . There have been positive incremental changes but I still read so many online comments by those who want A&M to only serve certain students whose values and culture match up with theirs.,What rights do animals have at TAMU?

Texas A&M has added three COVID-19 testing kiosks around campus to provide free::: walk-up testing for students::: faculty::: staff::: as well as people unaffiliated with the university!  It is not necessary to schedule an appointment in advance::: and test results are typically returned within two days: tx.ag/COVID19kiosk,2020-10-13 17:32:00,So true!! Good job Gig’em Aggies!! Whoop!! 👍👍👍,Steve Snapper Jones::: you look like a young man::: so I’m going to give you some advice as an almost 53 year old nurse who has seen a lot and learned a lot in her days.  COVID is not just about you or people under 25. It is about society and those who cannot protect themselves because they are older::: more frail::: and have problems beyond their control in many cases. Elderly people have died because a grandchild unintentionally gave them COVID.  We can’t expect these higher risk people to sit at home for months on end. They still have to go to the grocery store::: get gas::: etc.  You say “follow the science”? Well.... the “science” is that younger people pass it on to older people and they can get extremely sick or die. THAT is the science. I would suggest you look into yourself a little harder and realize that YOU are not alone in this world and it is your obligation as a human to help protect others. It’s called “the common good”. I think if you get that attitude::: you will find that as you look outside of yourself more::: you’ll live a happier::: healthier life.,To all on those on this post stating comments about asymptomatic carriers.... testing asymptomatic individuals is a waste. They can take the test::: get a negative and literally contract the virus the same day (maybe within hours::: who knows) and still be asymptomatic. So one would need to test every single day in order to fully know without a doubt that they are not infected. A negative test is only good for that moment in time that it’s administered.,Prevention does not = fear.... it is being smart,Grateful A&M is providing this for our Ags. My daughter’s roommate tested positive and my daughter was able to get tested for free on campus (negative). She tested again this week to be certain before she comes home.,In case anyone is curious::: fewer than 400 americans under 25 have died WITH covid. Follow the science,Where were these for the flu...? Or Pneumonia...? Such a joke. This virus is ridiculous. Everyone will get it eventually. Some will die. Quit changing our lives over it for nothing. 🤦🏼‍♂️,This is wonderful!!! Access to testing is so important!,These will be great to get the cases up with more false-positives to spread the FEAR!!,Wonderful for students and everyone! I think it’s great for students to be able to see if they are negative prior to going home and possibly visiting elderly relatives who are at higher risk. Good job::: A and M!!!!👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻,No way I would volunteer to be nasal swabbed::: my brain was violated that day...I'd rather just have the virus than get that test again.,Thank you Texas A&M,Why aren’t they using rapid tests?,in case anyone is really curious::: some people under 25 have infected their parents::: grandparents::: and other older people::: who then died.,What a generous gesture. And Dan::: that might be ok for some::: but I have seen some deaths and some who still suffer from effects of covid. Wear your mask and wash your hands.,Amazing how many people are offended by this. No ones forcing anyone to do anything. 🤦🏻‍♂️,Why would anyone want to test? If you are showing symptoms of getting/being sick::: just stay home. No test to inflate numbers needed.,Thank you for taking care of our Aggies::: Texas A&M. We appreciate you offering the testing and looking out for our kids!,Hope students take advantage of them!,Thank you::: Texas A&M! ❤ I'm sure a lot of parents feel relieved that you are providing this service!,Is this a saliva test or the dreaded nasal probe??,These rapid tests have only 70% accuracy as seen in Trump White House. It would be okay for screening but with exposure or symptoms should be followed up by stronger test.,You should only use a medical test if the answer will make a difference in what you actually do. 99% of college age purple will not get severe disease::: if they get sick AT ALL. None are likely to die. Stop testing and open up the school!,This is stupid. Why get tested for something when you are not sick.,Way to go A&M top notch all the way,Guess you wouldn't care unless it was your child or grandchild.,Much better than the tents::: in my opinion.,Why would any healthy person get tested? That’s ridiculous.,Very on brand! Love it!,Thank you::: TAMU::: for offering a testing option for those who may need it!!! ✌🏼🤟🏼👍🏼,Lol the comments here are so sad. Everyone that is reading this comment is currently experiencing the worst pandemic in their lifetime::: and you still can’t spare a split second to care about the well-being of other human beings? Laughable. I had multiple family members die due to COVID this summer::: and haven’t run into anyone in my 31 years of life who’s died of the flu...and yet you people still don’t get it. Crazy to me.,Be safe dear students..Take care,You mean I could of just gone there and walked right up and the sign would’ve said howdy? Instead where I went the BACK door opened into a dark hall and I felt like it the beginning of a haunted house!,A virus so deadly you have to get a test to see if you have it or not...,Where is the funding for testing unaffiliated persons coming from?,Any testing helps. Awareness helps. Mitigating helps. Wearing a mask helps. Gathering without a mask does not help. Doing nothing does not help...😷 Truly Helping others will never be bad...💞 Thank you for helping our Aggies stay in school safer!,I think that is great. Many places require you to have a negative test to return or a positive test to miss work so that is good,I hope these kiosks are using the most reliable tests available. If they aren’t::: it’s a waste of time and money,No need to test. Just stay home::: take two aspirin and drink plenty of liquids.,HOW ABOUT YOU FREE the 25 DOGS that are suffering in your cruel muscular dystrophy LAB?,Is there a cost to staff for these tests?,Love all the free testing A&M provides. Makes the trips home a lot safer,I've read a lot of stupid and in some cases heartless comments here. Yes::: stupid. Ignorance is lack of infomation but stupid is having the information and ignoring it. The bottom line is that COVID-19 is spiking again in many states and Texas is one of them. Believe the medical professionals and scientists not the guy running for four more years.,If you have it with no symptoms you will be giving it to others who may not be so lucky as you!!!!!! For those wondering why you should get tested and don’t have symptoms.,Way to go Aggies. Keeping students::: the community and families safe.,I usually do all my private health care testing at a public kiosk staffed with unknown entities... I hope they don’t have much business. I know I have advised my students to stay the Hell away.,Can you do it anonymously? Asking for a friend.,Keep trying to help us all::: Ags. Thanks for the effort!,The fact that some people believe that they are smarter then the EXPERTS is so funny! Yes we can believe what ever we want or who we want! it is our right! I know I know! It is still funny to read the comments though!!!😅,"Wonderful idea! I love the "" Howdy Aggies- don't pass it back"" sign. I wish more people cared about not sharing this virus. We didn't ask for a global pandemic-but it's here and it's our responsibility to try our very best not to spread it. Good bull!!! Go Ags! ❤👍",Hailey Spencer..THANK GOD its the oral swab..not the chip implant one..,That’s not sanitary...,Hey Collin Yetter do you realize that you are the only one who uses the laughing emoji. 210:::000+ dead people isn’t funny.,How accurate can they be ???🤔,Cost???,Pieces of shit stop torturing dogs,I would AVOID getting tested unless I was getting symptoms! Otherwise::: you open your friends up to contact tracing::: forced quarentines::: and contribute to the hysteria over a virus with a 99%+ survival rate! Just sayin',Step right up and find out if you have a 99.99% survivable virus!,Great idea! Super that it’s free and a fast result test,Thank you!!! We need more testing! Find those asymptomatic people. And verify negativity before traveling! Wish this was available everywhere,I urge Texas A&M University to close its dog laboratory::: release all dogs for adoption into good homes::: and redirect its resources into humane research methods. https:// www.peta.org/ blog/ remaining-dogs-t exas-a-and-m-la boratory/,https:// www.google.com/ amp/s/ www.saturdaydown south.com/ tamu-football/ covid-texas-am-a ggies-12th-man- social-distance /amp/,Brittany Rios-Ramos,Jennifer Schafer,Sarah Jarzombek,Rebecka Duenez,Way to go,Just say no.,Amy del Molino,Lizette Gonzalez,Hello!

They played their tunes and then the Aggie band took the field. This huge::: solid::: military-style band just left SMU with their mouths hanging open.

ESPN announcer just said that my city is no longer called College Station. “They merged Bryan-College Station!” Nothing could be further from the truth. They are two independent municipalities. Do your homework::: people! 😡,For clarification ESPN commentator::: Bryan and College Station have not merged. We are still 2 separate cities with our own city governments. Most of us just think of ourselves as one community.,The announcer for this game said that Bryan/ College Station has merged! What? Where did he get this information. Nothing is farther from the truth. As a life long resident of College Station::: other than the City of Bryan being right next to College Station...Texas A&M University is in COLLEGE STATION::: Texas...NOT Bryan. Do your research!,Could the commentators be a little more biased toward A&M?,Whoop! Gig’em from Amarillo!,Whoop Whoop,Wow::: loved watching the game without the talking heads. It was just like being at the game. You need to have many more broadcasts like this one. Great game as well. If you eliminated those talking heads::: look at all the money you would save?

GigEm!  https:// gbdeclaration.or g/,BTHO COVID-19::: Gig -um AGGIES!!!,Stay safe and all off the others around you.,Do your core values include inflicting torture on animals?  Release Cannoli::: a healthy dog who'd been used in TAMU muscular dystrophy dog laboratory. The school yanked him off the adoption list so that he could be transferred to another lab there.  RELEASE CANNOLI::: and END ANIMAL TORTURE! 👿,Awesome!,👍👍👍,Great job::: Keller! 🤗,No mask,Great job my friend!,Like your message Keller. Stay true and honest. Gig’em Aggie’s,Good Job Keller Cox!,C-19 death rate is all but gone. I really thought Aggieland had more courage and strength than to be dictated to by a bug that is clearly here with us and is running it's course::: like all the other illnesses we have around. We really need to look at the comorbidities surrounding all of this. Very sad that all our kids are missing out::: due to a .06% death rate virus. I know I'm not going to be popular in this thread::: but we are stronger than we're acting. Got 'em!👍🏻,Great job Keller Cox!,L,Whoop!,Proud to call you a friend Keller Cox !!! Btho covid,Whoop! 👍🏾,This place should be loved and liked.,👍🏼,Well done::: Ags.... proud of everyone being responsible and demonstrating what Aggies can accomplish when working together. It shows the world that just because you’re in college::: doesn’t mean you have to be careless of others or yourself. Great demonstration of sacrifice::: decorum::: respect for authority::: and what it means to BE an Aggie. GOOD. BULL. 👍🏻,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Texas A&M announced changes to the spring 2021 semester calendar: - The spring semester begins January 19th. - Classes end April 29th and finals conclude on May 7th. - Spring break shortened to one day to minimize extensive travel and allow the semester to conclude earlier for additional commencements. - Reading days on March 2nd and April 2nd.  Read more about the spring 2021 schedule: tx.ag/Spring21  TODAY.TAMU.EDU Texas A&M Announces Changes To Spring Semester Calendar - Texas A&M Today,2020-10-08 18:09:23,Your own results from the covid random testing program have shown that on-campus classes are not the place where transmission of covid is happening for the TAMU community. It's very unfortunate that you don't seem to have made in-person classes more accessible despite all the research proving that opening schools have not caused an increase in cases.,Brooke Henley Kelly Cockrum did y'all see this?? I don't need an extra week when I don't have class demands. I need that spring break to get my head above water on projects! Not a fan.,Thank you! Whoop! 👍🏻,You should have gone to school in the 1960’s. No spring break::: only Good Friday::: and we didn’t graduate until the end of January. We came back from Christmas break::: had two weeks more of classes::: then dead week::: then we had graduation. I know because I graduated on January 27::: 1967. It wasn’t from Texas A&M::: though.😬But my daughters graduated from Texas A&M.,As a mom::: I feel for families that will miss what may be their only opportunity during the semester to see with their kids.,So people already had to make and pay for spring break trips!,I don’t understand some of these posts. This just isn’t that big of a deal.,What the actual hell is the world coming to????,Spring break - gone. Silver Taps - gone (virtual only) But hey::: let’s have football!  🤦🏻‍♂️  This is bad bull. This ridiculousness has to end.,Personally I think the mental state of the students is what is vital. Taking away the opportunity to see family::: aka the only support system most have::: is not smart on TAMU's part. It's setting kids up to fail even more. This comes from experience. ~a,Spring Break for some Aggies we remember from June 6:::1941 ........ Here,Hope the admins don’t have any egg on their face come March when we supposedly will have multiple vaccines and antibody therapy treatments available. I think this decision is premature and overly cautious. The break (time away from studies) is there for a reason.,No spring break... welcome to adulting while in college,Getting the students prepared for life after college. Aka no spring break!!!,Some Aggies need to sit their “ one day off for Spring Break” next to Rudder fountain and contemplate what James Earl Rudder was doing to prepare for one Spring day back on June 6:::1941.,I haven’t had a spring break since I graduated.,What’s the point of a 1 day spring break. 1 day spring break is worthless.,Hopefully they are for America all the way!,Our country and the world needs to get used to the new order of business. Protect ourselves first and then try to live a normal life. This virus has at least another 6 months to a year of being in charge. Get used to schedule changes.,No spring break::: but we're doing commencement for graduating students with their family members joining. 🤔 And we're allowing football 🤣,"So many people in the comments miss their spring breaks and it really shows. I swear half of adulting is making sure you can flex on younger people about ""how good they have it"" and make sure everyone else is as miserable as you.",Save spring break 2021!,I’m guessing Lake Bryan will be wild that one day!,Really one day of spring break!! I know we can’t go anywhere but at least for us to have some type of break from school work!,Seems fair so they can have a graduation..unl ess your graduating::: most dont care,Should have known. Life rearranged.,There are no spring breaks in the real world of having a job and working. Look at it as preparation for the rest of your working life::: kiddos.,WOOOOHOOO!!!! I can't wait to see my daughter walk the stage!!🙌👩‍🎓eventhough its 1 year later...but better late then never!😁,"A bunch of you sound like children::: ""I don't get a spring break either."" How old are you? Of course we don't get them anymore::: we graduated and moved on. We had our time in the sun. I can bet that none of you ever would have given up your break willingly when you were in school ""well I don't get one after school so I won't take one now."" Find me one normal person who ever said that.  The time at school is short and a break is even shorter. Let them enjoy it before life moves on.",Wow no spring break.,Won’t they just go to the beach anyway and take their laptops?,The greatest parties I’ve ever been to in my life were called...Spring Break.,It will. Think of it as “temporary”! 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸,How to piss everyone off with your stupid new rules 101,I smell refund... lol,I understand why the university is making these schedule changes. Plus I like the thought of longer breaks between semesters. However::: maybe they can make a compromise. I noticed that fall and spring has two holiday days. In the fall::: they have two consecutive days for Thanksgiving. For the spring::: instead of taking a day off for Texas Independence Day::: which is on a Tuesday::: they can attach the second day to be consecutive with spring break. Or if they really want to honor independence day::: maybe move the single day for spring break on that Monday. At least you'll get a four day weekend. Also::: at my time at A&M::: I don't recall taking time off for Texas Independence Day. But that was more than 20yrs ago. Whatever happens::: sacrifices and hard decisions need to be made during these crazy times. All we can do is hope and pray for a safe and productive school year for the students.,Stupid. Why do you need to shorten Spring Break to allow more days for graduation ceremonies? Just have as many graduation ceremonies as you want after finals end. If someone really wants to walk::: they will be there.,"""tHeRE iS nO SpRiNG bReaK iN ThE rEAl WoRLd""  Well after 8 years in the military without it::: Spring Break was kinda nice to have. You know::: to relax and take it easy but I guess that's being entitled these days lol.",Please give Spring Break back.,The only benefit I see of such a ridiculously long break between semesters is that students can go WORK during that time and earn money to decrease their expanding debt loads. I used to work the month break between semesters. Either in retail or at my dad’s company. Possible to accumulate some seriously useful funds!$$$$,Good thing there is WiFi in Florida🌞,One day of Spring Break::: huh? That's a brilliant idea...,This is terrible - you canceled Spring Break! You're letting students disperse for two months between semesters and that's fine::: but a single week in Spring is too much?,Lol::: former student here but I'm so glad that this balances out the extended spring break last year. I was so jealous but now there is student life justice in the world. Hit the books::: ags! Should be the smartest group coming out of aggieland!,I hope Colorado has wifi,Why is there a reading day on a Tuesday?,Thank you for sharing. 😊 Our poor babies.,Sad no Spring Break but better that than no school.,Good decision::: thank you for letting us know well in advance.,Wow time is flying by fast!,No wild spring break trips to Padre! Selena DeLeon Marshall::: Tiffany Powell Pischel::: Katherine Zemanek::: Lindsay Luxardo Robeau::: Valerie Velez,Carol Alexander,Josh Kainth,Joshua Oldenkamp,Susan Bow,Juan Pablo Cabello Morón,Mandi Mitchon,Great decision.,HAHAHA omg Taylor Rose Baethge Hannah Wunderlich,Not Good Bull,Connor Phillips,Leo Escamilla Manuel Cerda,More ridiculous decisions,https:// i.imgur.com/ crWMDCp.png,Carsyn Williams,COVID fear!!,Cynthia Benton,Misty Varrichio,Guillermo Añez Lijeron,Jade Beauchamp Michelle Beauchamp,Stacey Trevino Garcia,Avione Davenport Maria Davenport,Shannon Seymour,Korey Tristen Villanueva,Millie Gomez Villanueva,Sara Wood,Addie Taylor,Denise Olguin lol,Marisa Bisaccia Rogstad,Allison Rivera Solorio Lisa Mitchell Michele Cash,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

How do you read it?” He said in reply::: “You shall love the Lord::: your God::: with all your heart::: with all your being::: with all your strength::: and with all your mind::: and your neighbor as yourself.” He replied to him::: “You have answered correctly; do this and you will live.” But because he wished to justify himself::: he said to Jesus::: “And who is my neighbor?” Jesus replied::: “A man fell victim to robbers as he went down from Jerusalem to Jericho. They stripped and beat him and went off leaving him half-dead. A priest happened to be going down that road::: but when he saw him::: he passed by on the opposite side. Likewise a Levite came to the place::: and when he saw him::: he passed by on the opposite side. But a Samaritan traveler who came upon him was moved with compassion at the sight. He approached the victim::: poured oil and wine over his wounds and bandaged them. Then he lifted him up on his own animal::: took him to an inn::: and cared for him. The next day he took out two silver coins and gave them to the innkeeper with the instruction::: ‘Take care of him. If you spend more than what I have given you::: I shall repay you on my way back.’ Which of these three::: in your opinion::: was neighbor to the robbers’ victim?” He answered::: “The one who treated him with mercy.” Jesus said to him::: “Go and do likewise.”,Thanks for sharing!,Beautiful 💙,Thank you,Dabudeedabudaaa,Laura L'Huillier Frazier,Thank you TAMU!! 😉❤🙏🏻🤗,Thank you!,Ashley Nelius,Kara Schulte Bock Hailey Bock Dawn Kotara Tera Reed Thompson,Wow!!

Very first Aggie identified as great-great grandfather of 2 current students By Carol Christian | October 22::: 2013 | Updated: October 22::: 2013 3:17pm á E-mail á Print Tweet 0 Page 1 of 1 Texas A&M University senior Lindsay Lawrence and her younger brother Zachary Lawrence are fifth-generatio n Aggies::: an undoubtedly small group. But the pair from Shiner can also claim an even more elite status - direct descendants of the man believed to be the school's very first enrollee. John Archibald McIver::: from Caldwell about 25 miles west of College Station::: was apparently the first student to enroll in A&M's first session::: which started on Oct. 4::: 1876. He was incorrectly listed as James Archibald McIver in the first student directory but a correction was made in the next year's list::: according to a university news release. Since A&M was the state's first public institution of higher learning::: that would make McIver the first student to enroll at a public college in Texas. Zachary Lawrence::: who is McIver's great-great-gra ndson::: is a sophomore psychology major and::: like the Aggie men in his family's four prior generations::: a member of the school's Corps of Cadets. Lindsay Lawrence::: who is not on campus this term::: is majoring in allied health. An older brother::: Ryan Lawrence ::: graduated from A&M last spring. They are related to McIver through his granddaughter::: Patsy McIver Lawrence ::: who is the wife of Allen S. Lawrence Jr. and their paternal grandmother. An often-told story in the Lawrence family history supports the belief that McIver was the first Aggie::: the news release said. ""What I've often heard family members say is that he rode over on horseback from Caldwell to enroll but was told he was a day early:::"" Zachary Lawrence said in a statement. ""Rather than ride back to Caldwell as he had planned::: he decided just to stay overnight. He slept under a tree that night and then registered the next morning."" The family has copies of newspaper stories reporting McIver's death in 1923 and noting he was the first student to register at Texas A&M. Also::: a photo of McIver is on display in the Sanders Corps of Cadets Hall of Honor on campus and includes a caption describing him as ""the first student to register at the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas :::"" as the school was known until 1963. School officials learned about the Lawrences' connection to Aggie history not from the students themselves but through a tweet from a former classmate of their father to Texas A&M President R. Bowen Loftin ::: the release stated. Asked why he had not mentioned this connection::: Zachary said he didn't want his family connection to be a factor in his admission::: according to the release. ""I wanted to get into Texas A&M on my own merits:::"" he said.

The golden retrievers and other dogs in the laboratory are deprived of the very things that make their life worth living::: as they spend every day stuck in barren metal cells. The dogs suffering from canine MD have undergone painful and terrifying testing::: and their health has steadily deteriorated to the point where it's difficult for them even to swallow their own saliva. Video footage shows that the healthy ones pace frantically and bite at the bars of their cages in frustration.  It's commendable that Texas A&M made the compassionate decision to stop breeding dogs to develop MD in 2019. Please do the next right thing and use your authority as a regent to order the release of the surviving dogs from the MD laboratory so that they may live the remaining years of their lives in warm::: loving adoptive homes.

Texas A&M Football defeats Vanderbilt in Kyle Field to start the season 1-0!,2020-09-26 20:49:00,Sad game. I’m sure none of the Ags are happy with it although a win is a win. LOTS of room for improvement. Look like a high school team. I hate to see what happens next week against AL 😢,This game proved to me that hand sanitizer is not the best replacement for wild turkey,For those that just say it’s haters you’re not understanding The big picture. This old song since Slocum has got to change. A new song has to be recorded. The new song has to be based upon leadership.It is absolutely mind boggling with the alumni support that we cannot have a championship caliber team. Those that call Aggies haters should really ask themselves a question: why is Auburn always at championship level? Why is Clemson at a championship level? Why is Georgia championship level? Why is Oregon at the same level? Answer: they don’t just recruit athletes that can run a 40. They recruit leaders in other words the program centers on leadership development and that includes coaches as well as the athletic department. That has to change if the program is going to be successful with the level of alumni support that exist today. All those above teams prepared for this crazy season and showed they could succeed. A&M must do the same thing be it this coach or somebody else based on not just athletes but those that want to succeed long-term as leaders.Gig’em!,It really is disgusting that we have the recruits and the coaches that we do::: but yet get these results. BENCH MOND!!!!!!!!!! And do something with these recruits.,Time for Mond to go. He has had every opportunity to step up for the Aggies. Time for Jimbo to step up as well. Needs to earn his money. I just keep waiting....wors t game I’ve ever watched. Fix it now!!,After all the hype::: 5 star recruits and Jobo as the head coach this season opener at home nonetheless was a massive disappointment to say the least. I wouldn't be bragging about a 17 to 12 win. If this is any indication of things to come::: its gonna be a very long season. Fasten your seat belts!,We only put up two touchdowns against VANDY lmao we might not even beat Arkansas this year,This win is nothing to celebrate.,The only 3 year returning Senior in the SEC. Has he learned anything? Nope. I am shocked Jimbo is putting up with his bullshit performances.,We get it The rest is the world needs to step up Get back to the state of mind Get back to the world we all know Stop letting corporations medical institutions::: pharmaceutical run our lives Back to family Back to education and respect for our teachers Back to scrutinizing govt::: health care Back kindness,Kellen Mond has to go!!! He is terrible! Inconsistent::: poor passer::: terrible ball control::: and has shown little to no improvement in his three years as a starter. Bench him! Sherman did it to Jerrod Johnson and Ryan Tannehill emerged.....,The truer headline is Vanderbilt lost to Texas A&M. The Aggies didn’t DEFEAT anyone.,New season::: same story...defense is the reason the team wins or stays in the game. No consistency from the offense...this was an ugly game..a win in spite of...I don't blame Mond::: I blame Jimbo and his staff. 3 years and they look no better than when Sumlin was there...not sure I will be watching next week if this is what the team looks like::: that would just be too painful to watch. But::: as always::: Gig Em Aggies!,Can we punch Mond and Fischer in the face really really hard?!?!? A junior high football team could probably beat us right now. FML!!!,Definition of insanity. Sticking with Mond over and over again and expecting different results.,At least Mond has another year of eligibility...,Mond still has that look of fear in his eyes. Better luck next year!,Barely...and no::: a win is not a win. This is an embarrassing win. We want to be in contention for national championships::: we have to win the easy ones convincingly. Now to prepare for Bama,Everyone be blaming Mond for the failures of the o-line. The quarterback isn't the only player::: folks.,It’s a win. Move on. It’s gonna be a long season . That was a true freshman QB torching us. Imagine Bama....,Defeat is a strong word. Perhaps it should say at least we didn’t lose.,Haters need to move on! So sick of your negativity. These kids are playing with half of the the 12th man. It’s a totally different dynamic than anything they’ve ever known. It has to be so tough on them. Gig ‘em Aggies!!! 👍🏼,Win::: I take it. Mond played like a true freshman for 4 years. Opponent’s true freshman played like a veteran junior or senior.,Can we fire Fisher yet?,Did anyone watching on TV get what made the Vandy coach so mad that he got a PF? We were at the game so just saw him waving his arms.,Takes a lot of guts to even pretend like this wasn’t embarrassing.,Mond is horrible- his leaving will be welcomed,Kellen Mond better get a useful degree because his football days are numbered.,Vanderbilt gave game away and let A&M win. Mond has to go.,No excuse for Mond. Same system. Time for next man up.,Dumpster Fire 2020,Wasn't pretty... got the W::: got work to do...,Home sick watching the Ags. I know it's 2020 and nothing is normal but that game was supposed to make me feel better. Well not so much.,Thank God for the defense. The offense was hell bent on giving the ball to whoever would take it.,We are celebrating this garbage????,Glad we won but that was pitiful. Mond is horrible and it's even worse knowing that he's a 3rd year starter.,More PRACTICE!!! Less PROTEST!!!,Should have won by a lot more. Very poor showing. We need a qb,Some of you “Aggies” are unbearable. Bad bull is all I’m seeing across all these Aggie social media feeds.,If Mond is this careless with the ball next week::: Bama will finish us before the first half is over.,We were lucky to pull that out. Yikes,Not a joy to watch.,Pros: our defense (most of the time)  Cons: everything else,Mond is no better as a senior than he was as a freshman. Always seems to be unsure of what to do and holds the ball too long. It’s time to work someone else in as QB.,Mond has got to go!!,That was such a pain to watch,Would be great if that was a baseball score. Not promising for a football game.,It’s going to take an exorbitant amount of alcohol to make it through this season! 🥃,3 year starter in Mond gets out played by a true Freshman in Seal! A QB from Texas no less...,I agree. Everyone has raved about him since the day he was made the starter but I’ve yet to see much improvement. Granted the O line hasn’t lived up to expectations much of the time but I really doubt many pro teams will go after him.,Looks good on paper. Video::: not so much. Maybe if you guys had good TV coverage::: more people could of watched. Took me most of the day to find SECN alternative.,Right now::: 25 dogs—at least 12 of whom are perfectly healthy::: adoptable::: and without disease symptoms—are still being warehoused in Texas A&M University's canine muscular dystrophy (MD) laboratory::: despite the retirement of lead experimenter Joe Kornegay and the lack of funding for new experiments.  The golden retrievers and other dogs in the laboratory are deprived of the very things that make their life worth living::: as they spend every day stuck in barren metal cells. The dogs suffering from canine MD have undergone painful and terrifying testing::: and their health has steadily deteriorated to the point where it's difficult for them even to swallow their own saliva. Video footage shows that the healthy ones pace frantically and bite at the bars of their cages in frustration.  It's commendable that Texas A&M made the compassionate decision to stop breeding dogs to develop MD in 2019. Please do the next right thing and use your authority as a regent to order the release of the surviving dogs from the MD laboratory so that they may live the remaining years of their lives in warm::: loving adoptive homes.  Thank you for your consideration of this important matter.,Fisher couldn’t care less what anyone says about his program::: after all he has a ten year guaranteed contract negotiated by a man whose foremost loyalty was to LSU,Mond might be the slowest decision maker in the SEC. I'll bet that he delivers the ball on time 1 in 10 pass plays. It totally destroys our offense. Don't get me started on fumbles.....,Mond wasn’t great::: but he wasn’t bad. The whole team just looked bad. Stupid penalties::: giving up big plays on defense::: dropped passes::: etc. We are nowhere near a top tier SEC team. That $75 million to Jimbo is giving us a pretty poor ROI right now...,Now let’s see how many people got sick just for the college to make some money,Offense didn’t play well tonight::: but even a scratch golfer can go out and shoot an 85 once in a while. I think they’re going to be fine.,Not pretty but a win. Better improve a lot before next Saturday.,THAT WAS ABSOLUTE TRASH AND MOND TWEETING HIS DIPSHIT SJW MESSAGE ABOUT THE LADY LEGALLY SHOT BEFORE THE GAME SHOULD HAVE LOST IT FOR HIM. PULL MONDS SCHOLARSHIP. GIVE IT TO A SCIENCE MAJOR. THEY ARE WORTH IT.,Kellen mond is garbage! What have we done to deserve 4 years of his mediocrity???,Mond beat Bama::: and then we talk. Listen to me Fisher::: Mond has to become a Double Threat QB. Please stop the bs and the talking Kellen Mond. You talk to talk now is time to Walk to walk. You have a great coach learn and listen.,Now if only we had a competent offense maybe we would be decent. At the moment I'm expecting at least a 3 possession loss to Bama,Very ugly::: very undisciplined::: especially the offense. If they hadn’t had Spillers::: and occasionally Smith::: they would’ve had no offense.,Everybody needs to remember that this was the first game - normally we get to gripe about how we can’t compete against teams like “A&M Prairie View” cause we only won by 3 points... we’re just going to play Bama next week... what could go wrong?,The 12th man wagging the flag in an empty stadium is telling. Everybody went home at halftime.🤣,This was an ugly win. But it’s a win. Let’s move on and put the mistakes behind us.,If it’s not a timing pass that’s been practiced 1:::000 times::: incomplete.,Just barely. Hopefully they can work out the problems because next weekend we are DOOMED,I agree about Mond being pretty bad for a 3 year starter. However::: does that mean that everyone else behind him is worse? Anybody have insight on the backups?,Sad to see so many relishing in Mond’s sub par performance. Aggies first...partisa n politics never in football.,Barely won...need skill and not luck,I don't even know what to think about that game. Better step it up before next week.,17-12. Ok::: a win is a win::: I guess. Gig’em?,Play like that next week::: and there’ll be a beat down in Tuscaloosa.,Aggies win! Some cleaning up to do::: but a win is a win.,You made Vanderbilt look like a tough opponent. Bama would beat them by 35 plus points.,Wondering if anyone can describe the game plan .,I have come to the conclusion that if TAMU were to win 5 national Champions there would still haters form the Aggie Nation! “We only won by 50 and won the National Championship. #fire the coach and punch the QB in the face!” Sounds like the crap I see in the news nightly. The game was sloppy! It was game one in a screwed up year. No excuses I’m disappointed but if your not on the team (player) why are you talking like you could do better? If your not a coach or a kinesiology major studying to be a coach and haven’t won a National Championship as a coach speak up! Otherwise shhhhhhh! It doesn’t happen overnight. So much crying that’s all I hear from our Aggie Nation. Gig’em Aggies Congratulations on the win! Whoop!,More like Vandy head coach concedes in the final minutes.,Why is he wearing a mask by himself?,"Feels like an ""L""::: w/lots of ""L""'s on the way w/Mond and this kind of play. :( When do we start talking a/b ""hot seat""?!",Those refs were amazingly HORRIBLE!,Well::: we can only go up from here.,Texas A&M University Go Aggies::: but I would still like to know more about when May and August graduates can have our ceremonies.,Wow::: super impressed aggies😳 will make sure Not to watch next weekend,That a awesome game::: I loved it,You put an exclamation point on that ?,Imma need them to get it together!!! Whew. That was rough.,We didn't win::: we escaped,Free cannoli and the other dogs in the lab. You offered him up for adoption but then shipped phim to another lab. He deserves a chance to be surrounded by people who love him and will not torture him . Https:// www.dallasnews.c om/news/ education/2019/ 09/12/ texas-am-researc hers-quietly-br ed-sick-dogs-in -hopes-of-findi ng-human-muscul ar-dystrophy-cu re/,PLEASE::: Jimbo. Give us a new quarterback and let mond go do his protesting elsewhere!,Favored by 31.5 at home. 'Win' by 5.,Why on earth is that guy wearing a mask? 🤦‍♂️,Mond did everything he could to lose the game for the Ags,Nothing to be proud of there. O line wasn’t holding ground. Mond was typical Mond. Defense kept us alive. Ball control is a huge issue. We barely snuck out with that. Poll ranking gonna drop with this performance. Maybe Mond should quit with the politics and work on heart and Aggie pride,A win is a win but there was surely no btho-ing,Bring back Kyler Murray lol jk Gig’em! Let’s go wrecking crew!,* Kind of beat the hell out of Vandy.,Mediocrity...wh at we have come to expect.,Yikes... glad to have the w::: but not looking good for next week,Ugly win. Special teams - wth?,Sloppy across the board but the defense stepped up in the 2nd half and won this game but Seriously what the hell does Jimbo see in Mond? It's his 3rd season and no improvement from year to year I been saying it every season that Mond is not and will never be the guy to get us to the next level.. I certainly look forward to going 1-1 at Bama next week,They looked like shit and so does the QB he needs to go,Yeah this isn’t really anything to celebrate lol....,Very sloppy. Needs to be addressed.,Energetically apathetic. This is not a #10 team,I felt like even I could steal the ball from our offense... Sitting at home! 😂  And Mond.. Drop him rn..,Give someone else the position of quarterback.,This is gonna be a Mediocre season,There’s always next year!! 🤣🤣,Pathetic win over a team we should have dropped 50+ on.,Get ready for another mediocre year!,So::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::A labama next? 😂,"No need for promotion of this ""Win"". For damn sure.",Get rid of Mond. Enough is enough.,Next week's gonna be rough...,Gig em Aggies,Play calling at the end of the half sucked. End of the 4th too. Chicken shit.,JIMBO IS OVERPAID! Hahaha,Struggle win against Vandy? Shame....,Pathetic. Please get rid of Mond. Convince him to opt out.,You guys rock,That was an ugly game,antifa mond. He delivers like Sloppy Joe Biden will !,https:// www.dallasnews.c om/sports/2019/ 07/23/ texas-am-s-kelle n-mond-i-m-the- best-qb-in-the- sec/ ?outputType=amp,#5 Bobby Brown needs to be suspended for a game for that cheap shot in the back. That’s not a good trait and it needs to be addressed. That’s not aTm.  It’s also time to put in #10 Zach Calzada. Vandy is a joke in the SEC East which means they are hysterical in the West. Kellen just seems indecisive. Again. It’s not his fault::: but he checks down a lot. That’s on the coach.  Which brings me to #FireJimbo yet again. Sure he’s had recruiting power::: but he’s still calling ridiculous plays. We have so much talent that we shouldn’t be trying to win games or keep the ball away in the 4th quarter.  Gotta get better #gigem next week.,This game shouldn’t have been close,Jeannie Alexander 😘,Meh,Do you want to become a member of a great temple and be a star in the world::: or you want to become very rich in life and nobody can stop you from it::: or you want to become famous in life for people to know you much and give you that respect::: if interested then become the Illuminati member and never be poor again cause we will give you all your wish you need from our temple as a member of the great Illuminati kingdom::: WhatsApp +2349055406125 or email illuminatiheadb ranch@gmail.com,#benchkellenmond,Defense looked good,Good luck with bama y’all better wake up,Boo,Pitiful Pitiful Pitiful,That was a joke,Low scoring‼️,Emilia Cano,Congratulations Aggies for your job well done 🏈🏈🏈🏈,WHOOP WHOOP 🙌,Just.... don't.

It's good to be back.,2020-09-26 19:22:00,Is A&M Consolidated High School playing at Kyle Field tonight. Aggies are horrible. Jimbo Fisher is in his 3Rd year and has done nothing for $70 Million salary. Fisher needs to be fired for the pathetic football performance. Kellen Mond has 3 years being quarterback and still can’t hold onto the football and horrible passing. This is due to Fisher’s inability to coach. Fire Jimbo Fisher Now without pay,Big win tonight against a tough opponent!,I wish the team would have shown up though.,Whoop!,Can't wait to see how many new cases of Corona pop up after that game. The pandemic ain't over folks just because football has begun.,Great to see the football game coming back. I noticed how self distancing and wearing a face mask doesn't apply when at a football game.,Laura Judah,Young::: healthy kids have over a 99% chance of getting over COVID with no complications. If they catch it::: they will be fine. Kids with underlying conditions need to protect themselves. Hopefully at this age...they know in which category they sit.,"I noticed a lot of post ""made by parents"" of their Aggie kids showing excitement before and during yesterday's game. Most all were with a friend (or several friends) all smiles and NOT wearing a face mask. I wonder how many of these ""parents"" will be as pleased 10-14 days from now when their kid calls them to say they tested positive with COVID.",Best thing is TAMU 1-0 lsu 0-1,#benchMond,I don’t call 5 points a big win! To many stupid mistakes and turnovers!,"Kind of a joke to say ""back"" when referring to a game day with a empty city::: no tailgating::: empty stadium::: not allowing the band to march. How is this ""back""???? Other than Mond doing what he does best... sit on the sideline when A&M is playing defense. Seldom does he screw that up.",👍,Whoop Whoop Aggies are kicking butt,Good to be back at Kyle Field....great night for football....now just need the team...,Listen to all the griping and complaining on here. The post was meant to just highlight being happy that college football was back in Aggieland. Honestly y'all::: if you can't just be happy for one minute::: you need to reevaluate a few things. Opening night is always a great night to be an Aggie 👍🏼👨🏽‍🌾,It’s not good to have Mond back though,If y’all like TAMU y’all will like The N&K Pod!!! Catch us on YouTube and iHeart Radio!!,Whoop whoop Kick Vanderbilt’s butts,👍,Corona and death is apparently less scary than not being able to watch football. Fucking suckers.,Cancelled ring day and graduation::: but the force field of the 12th man protects Kyle field on football days ✨😌,John Nicholson brian and I are in this picture!!!,Whoop '11!!,How I wish I could smell my sweet Aggieland,Texas A&M University Can we get an update on May and August graduations and when we will be able to have our ceremonies? If we can have football games in person we can have graduations in person. While I’m at it::: if we can have football games in person we can have Silver Taps in person. If we can have football games in person we can have Ring Day’s in person.,Does anyone have an extra ticket for the Florida game?,Do you want to become a member of a great temple and be a star in the world::: or you want to become very rich in life and nobody can stop you from it::: or you want to become famous in life for people to know you much and give you that respect::: if interested then become the Illuminati member and never be poor again cause we will give you all your wish you need from our temple as a member of the great Illuminati kingdom::: WhatsApp +2349055406125 or email illuminatiheadb ranch@gmail.com,Whoop!,Defense good same Mond and coach::: bench one and send Fisher on his way.,Calzada....star t the conversation!,Whoop,As of last week::: 500 cases were reported. In two weeks we'll see what it rises to.,So If this can happen::: Graduation can happen. End of story.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“Now forming at the north end of Kyle Field…”  Watch the Fightin’ Texas Aggie Band perform on Kyle Field for the first time this season!,2020-09-26 19:03:00,Even though I bleed orange::: I can still enjoy other college bands and their performances. Thanks for sharing it with me.,Loved this. So great to have the memories. Still gives you goose bumps. Big band!

I remember my high school football days and our band would play the Aggie War Hymn as it gave us a bit more energy.,If they can do pre recorded they should be allowed to do live. The best college band in the world::: the FTAB. A football game without the band is not as fun.,Thanks for recording this and showing on JumboTron during halftime.

Always a treat.,I’m obviously bummed that they weren’t performing live...that being said::: the drills on the videotape were still amazing to watch. Just one little favor...could the videographer zoom in more and also raise the volume? Half the picture was of the empty stadium and I would have liked to see some of the band members up close—like they do on a normal halftime Jumbotron,I wonder if the band members get to go to school for free like the football players,The only reason I go to the football games. Don't care about the football::: but love the band!,Texas A&M University - it was a good performance::: but couldn't hear anything. How about the band play live (from their seats) and play the video?,ALWAYS a spectacular sight to see them on the field!,Why didnt they actually march at the game?,My nephew is on that field somewhere!!!

Our team not so hot,We (who are of the Baylor Nation) love the Texas Aggie Band::: every time we hear it!,I would suggest showing the marching on the screen::: but let the band play the music in the stands.,I first saw an empty stadium then I remembered all those that have gone before::: fought and died for our freedoms. Suddenly the stadium was full to the brim::: they all had a seat. WHOOP!!!,Nowhere else can you watch such precision and honor,Love the Fighting Aggie Band!,They are spectacular in any setting!,Y’all::: tears of joy! So much emotion seeing the Pulse of Aggieland! I’d come just to watch them!,Not allowing the band to perform at halftime has got to be one of the lamest rules of all the lame Covid rules put in place to date world wide,No spectators!

The guidelines have been approved differently by Governor Abbott::: thus we’re allowed to sell only 20% of stadium tickets. There were several major CDC and state rulings they had to follow even during midnight yell practice if you watched it streaming.... The band didn’t take the field and march ::: no Corp march in .... just marched on the outside way before start of game. There were NO priorities::: just following what the Government of Texas allowed.

Now we know for sure the priorities of Texas A&M!,Calvin Neal,What happened to the national anthem? By time SEC network started broadcasting they were on the first play 😢,BTHO Vanderbilt,will the fake hate crime student be there?,Rules are being made to justify the means. Not much common sense is being applied.

Welcome to Aggieland::: Ambassador Birx!  The White House's COVID-19 coordinator visited Texas A&M yesterday to meet with students and campus leadership::: crediting low infection rates to Aggies' selfless service! http://tx.ag/DrBirx,2020-09-23 09:27:00,President Young joining the State dept. confirmed. 🤣,How are you there l Jam well and happy for welcoming you to support me financially to run well then work of God thank you in advance may God bless abundantly amen,wolf in SCARF clothing,Welcome back again to Texas Aggies land,Outstanding! How was A&M so fortunate to be able to have her appear in person. What a great opportunity. Sad how people are demeaning this woman (all b/c of their blind hatred for the President). She has such an accomplished career! thanks for sharing her address so my family and I can watch it,The scarf lady speaketh.,It also helps that we quarantine our active COVID cases in Austin also::: preferably on t.u.'s campus,l am pastor clarance barasa l request you to stand with me in this church the lord Jesus Christ church in Kenya l need to work with you amen,Free cannoli and the other dogs in the lab.

This came from someone that attended a zoom call with her.,Oh my::: I would have loved to hear her address!,Has about the same turnout as her boss’ inauguration did!!!,Chaney Bell Vincent,Welcome to Aggieland::: Dr. Birx,Right now::: 25 dogs—at least 12 of whom are perfectly healthy::: adoptable::: and without disease symptoms—are still being warehoused in Texas A&M University's canine muscular dystrophy (MD) laboratory::: despite the retirement of lead experimenter Joe Kornegay and the lack of funding for new experiments.  The golden retrievers and other dogs in the laboratory are deprived of the very things that make their life worth living::: as they spend every day stuck in barren metal cells. The dogs suffering from canine MD have undergone painful and terrifying testing::: and their health has steadily deteriorated to the point where it's difficult for them even to swallow their own saliva. Video footage shows that the healthy ones pace frantically and bite at the bars of their cages in frustration.  It's commendable that Texas A&M made the compassionate decision to stop breeding dogs to develop MD in 2019. Please do the next right thing and use your authority as a regent to order the release of the surviving dogs from the MD laboratory so that they may live the remaining years of their lives in warm::: loving adoptive homes.  Thank you for your consideration of this important matter.,Great job Aggies. I wish someone would of given here an Aggie mask and one of the beautiful Aggie scarves.,Whoop,Oh wow !

Records from Texas A&M University indicate that Ganondorf collapsed in his kennel and died on January 21::: 2020::: three months shy of turning 10 years old. Multiple times over the nine days before he died::: experimenters observed blood in the kennel where the dog was imprisoned alone. Even when blood was smeared on the wall and floor and he was reported as having a decreased appetite::: experimenters simply advised::: ""Continue to monitor."" Born in a laboratory::: Ganondorf had a life of unmitigated pain and misery—treated for all of his years as a piece of equipment. Given that experimenters failed to intervene to help him when he was suffering::: PETA has filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Agriculture urging the agency to investigate the university for violating the federal Animal Welfare Act.  In February 2020::: PETA obtained records revealing that Bruno—a dog suffering from canine muscular dystrophy who never knew a single moment of freedom—had died in November 2019::: just months before his 10th birthday. In his final days::: his appetite diminished as his weakened muscles made it even more difficult for him to swallow::: and he struggled to breathe. On November 29::: a laboratory worker described him as ""very depressed … [n]o appetite and reluctant to get up or move."" Because of his worsening health problems—compli cations of the disease that he was intentionally bred to have—Bruno was euthanized later that day. It's not too late to help other dogs at Texas A&M who've been imprisoned for a decade::: as Bruno was. Please take action below.

Thanks Lisette!!,Mackenzie,Love it! 👍,Herpes is a sexually transmitted virus that primarily infects the mouth and the genitals. It is transmitted by bodily fluids – penetration isn’t required for transmission::: oral-oral or oral-genital contact will suffice:::There are two types of herpes simplex virus: HSV-1 and HSV-2. Both virus types can cause sores around the mouth (herpes labialis) and on the genitals (genital herpes). Cold sores are caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). Cold sores sometimes called fever blisters::: are groups of small blisters on the lip and around the mouth. The skin around the blisters is often red::: swollen::: and sore. The blisters may break open::: leak a clear fluid::: and then scab over after a few days. They usually heal in several days to 2 weeks. The herpes simplex virus usually enters the body through a break in the skin around or inside the mouth. It is usually spread when a person touches a cold sore or touches infected fluid—such as from sharing eating utensils or razors::: kissing an infected person::: or touching that person's saliva. A parent who has a cold sore often spreads the infection to his or her child in this way. Cold sores can also be spread to other areas of the body. Luckly there is a cure for herpes Contact Dr Odia Via:(Dr Odia Herbalist home on Facebook),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

President Young has announced his retirement as president of Texas A&M::: effective May 31::: 2021.  Texas A&M Office of the President September 2::: 2020 at 7:49 AM ·,2020-09-02 13:53:08,Please replace him with someone whose core values represent Aggie tradition.,Needs to be effective immediately!,Sharp turned the system chancellor role into control over the College Station campus. Previous system chancellors were much more modest in how they involved themselves in College Station.  I appreciate Young accepting the job. I thought his delegation of all responsibility to Scott Woodward over athletics allowed Scott to be the spear catcher for what is an impossible job at Texas A&M: the running of the football program is much more important to some fans of the team than running the school itself.  I think Young got too far ahead of what is a fairly conservative former student contingent of about half a million living former students with many of the things he said and did. It all might have been the exact right thing to do::: but it reminds me of the feckless school leaders and faculty in the 60s.  Since this happened in Sharp’s watch::: it probably is time for him to retire as well.,Please hire an Aggie who understands our mission and values.,Bring back R. Bowen,Needs to go sooner and no longer be associated with the school that he tried to destroy!,Good. Maybe he has some saved up vacation time he can use::: maybe 9 months worth?,That’s one more year to screw things up more. Buy-out now::: and good riddance.,Don’t let the doorknob hit you on your way out. Can you go earlier?,Thank your for your service::: President Young!  To all the Aggies on this post who are making some rude comments: let’s not forget our core value of RESPECT. Many great strides were made under Dr. Young’s presidency.,Was never a good fit. Bring back Bowen,As a new Aggie parent::: I’m disheartened by the spirit of many of the comments here. We sent our kid to a place that values respect for others. It’s not playing out here. 😕,Put an Ag in charge dammit!,All these people cheering Pres. Young leaving like Chancellor Sharp’s going to appoint anyone who isn’t completely in line with the system board of regents,Good!,🙌🏻Praise the Lord. Let’s recruit a True Aggie for the post!,Maybe the next leader can figure out when to hold commencement ceremonies for the class of 2020...,You guys realize that to receive federal funding::: higher ed institutions can't impose neo-conservativ e values like science denying::: racism::: sexism::: and evangelical Christian doctrine? 🙄,As much as I hate to say it::: I think he is making the correct decision. His ability to lead the school in this environment has been called into question too many times recently. Aggieland needs strength and a new perspective. However::: I am happy he has chosen to join the Bush School. I think his expertise will go a long way in helping guide future leaders. Good luck sir::: wish you the best!,About time-should have been an immediate firing::: and he should be leaving Texas A&M; he has nothing GOOD to offer. From reading these comments::: it is evident that many Aggies have and had no confidence in his ability to lead A&M; what does this say about our Board of Regents or Chancellor Sharp for keeping him on?,Jarrell Patton Unfortunately::: a NEW position has been made just for him at the Bush School. He is in charge of “Religious Liberty and International Affairs”. Wonder how that will work as under his tenure Silver Taps was cancelled. Religious violation? Cut the budget/tuition by sending him back to Washington State or California,PLEASE hire a true Aggie for this position! No more outsiders who have no connection or even basic understanding of what it means to be an Aggie. It cannot be that hard to find a former student qualified for this position...,Let's get someone who will love A&M & their traditions. WHOOP! GIG 'EM AGGIES! 👍👍👍 Wishing him all the best in future endeavors.,Wow::: some of y’all are awful on here. Really.,Have a great retirement Dr. Young. I disagreed with much of your policy and leadership and hope a better fit comes for both you and Aggieland. Best wishes.,All due respect::: Happy retirement. Now do the right thing and bring a more conservative leader back to Aggieland!,I just want to know when Graduation is planned for Spring and Summer 2020 Graduates? Remember it’s just postponed. Football is starting so I’d imagine graduation could happen. It’s meaningful to the Aggies that have worked so hard.,I’m out of the loop on President Young controversy but I’m surprised that especially women are calling for no change and keeping things status quo. Women have only been admitted for less than 60 years and that was on a limited basis. If we need new leadership that’s one thing but what are you really talking about here?,Thank you for your service President Young!  Disappointed in a lot of Ag’s on here. Even if you disagreed with some of his policy and leadership that doesn’t mean you should disrespect the man.  “We are the Aggies::: the Aggies are we::: True to each other as Aggies can be”,Robert Gates was the BEST president hands down! Let’s bring him back!!,Texas A&M should have plenty of viable candidates who are former students who understand the value of the University without bringing in outside people who are oblivious to the traditions and meaning of the heart and spirit of Texas A&M. Young damaged the spirit bc he doesn’t get it.,Thank goodness!! Now hire a true::: conservative::: traditional::: respectable AGGIE leader for TAMU that will uphold core values.,Being ‘conservative’ is not part of a job description to be the president of a major university. Respect for the history and legacy of any institution::: yes::: but political ideology::: no. Scholarship::: credentials::: leadership experience::: a demonstrated ability to deal with faculty and students::: all yes::: being politically conservative::: no. It’s not a political office.,He’s not the only one that needs to go. Lots of administrators don’t understand or believe in the traditions or core values. For example my Aggie was told in a leadership training event that core values should be fluid during these troubled times::: and Old Ag and Old Army should be dropped from the Aggie vernacular because they were used during racist times. We need a leader who will stamp out such nonsense.,Thank you got your service and guidance during trying times.,Things are changing but not for the better. Chancellor Sharp I know you are hardcore old army but are still seek progress every day. I saw these same traits when you were student body President my jr yr. 1972. I count you as a friend not necessarily by proximity but common beliefs. I have been fortunate to cross paths since then and my respect only grows.,Respect is one of the Aggie core values. Whether you agreed or disagreed with Dr. Young’s leadership or decisions::: please be respectful. Here lately::: not seeing much of that. Gig’em.,I see a whole bunch of Aggie Karens::: regardless of gender::: ironically name calling someone in power for not upholding Aggie values 🤣. We are all ambassadors of the Spirit of Aggieland - let’s set the example.,Best news of the day. But why wait-\-\make it effective now.,Thank you god. You were one of the worse Presidents in my lifetime at this school.,Couldn't come soon enough. Enjoy retirement but leave my school alone,Respect to the office; poor leadership.,Does this mean we can put the star back on the seal?,I hope the next person can undo some of the damage he has done to our school. Many things make TAMU unique compared to “those other schools”. Let’s get back to the basics of what being an Aggie is about. Think he is a good guy just not the right fit for TAMU.,If he’s retiring does that mean he will be getting money from the school for the rest of his life? If so::: how much?,Dr Young may have impressive academic credentials::: but he lacks the emotional stamina required to lead the University. Maybe instead of being so triggered by a possible racist incident::: as in June::: he will learn to wait until investigations are completed before assuming the bigoted Aggie community is to blame. The thought that the incident was possibly a hoax never seemed to cross his mind. He had a chance to be fair and impartial...but instead his true “feelings” about our community guided his response....and they were wrong. He assumed the worst of us.... and it indeed turned out to be a racial hoax. So... we are supposed to be sad about his departure? Did he ever comment further about his error? Maybe I missed that letter??,Good!!! Get out of there before May if you can!!!,Thank you for your service President Young!  The next President should be someone who upholds the traditions and respect that makes Aggieland the special place we all love! I know many former students and myself were upset with the cancellation of Silver Taps! The next President should know the significance of all our traditions and uphold them! Texas A&M is not a progressive university. Most of the alumni who donate a large amount of money to the university are not progressive. When making the choice for President one should keep the alumni and donors in mind with their pick if they would like to continue receiving donations. The next President should embody the true Aggie Spirit!,We need a true old Ag in charge!,I agree with the comments we should be respectful::: but I also agree this change is well overdue.,Thank you so much for bringing this institution to the 21st century::: despite dragging some with you kicking and screaming. I sincerely hope the person that follows only keeps moving us forward and not take 10 steps back. Improvise::: adapt. overcome.,I would like to think that when I retire one day the adults around me would be adult enough to be respectful. Guess that's too much to ask for many on here. Disgusting.,The next hire is so predictable::: well::: if you’ve been following along it is.,Good riddance.,Need someone who reflects the founding traditions and values of Texas A&M.  Young wasn’t ever close.....  Pick a leader next time.,This is terrible leadership.  Been waiting to leave for a year and now he’s going to stay till mid next year ? Most business wouldn’t allow an employee to stay on the Payroll with this mindset and I’m not sure how the president gets too???  During one of the most important times the university may face is what makes it worse.  I don’t understand how our university accepts this. This is Leadership role for 60:::000+ student’s where he’s already checked out and has been.,I had Robert Gates as my president when I was there ... a true bad ass! would suck any other way 👍🏼,Hello Mr. Young. Did you know your university is performing experiments on dogs that leave them to endure a lifetime with the painful::: debilitating symptoms of muscular dystrophy? I dont think others do either. https:// support.peta.org /page/1007/ action/ 1?locale=en-US,Yay! It’s about time.,When will you releasee the dogs you keep prisoners for your cruel and inhumane experiments!!!! Release them now!!!!!!,The only one worse was Mr. Gates.,People that object to doing things for the wellbeing of all::: think being Conservative is being a better human being. Ha! Like if everybody's wellbeing was a question of opinion or political beliefs. I'm glad Mr. Young will be staying until next year when my child will be done with college.,Are there any Former Aggies⁉️I thought Aggies were like Marines—once an Aggie::: always an Aggie❗️,Ive been out of the loop. Why does everyone hate president young?,Wish they would actually fire this guy but I guess demotion to a made up position is a good start.,Thanks::: Dr. Young! You should go ahead and leave now. There’s no sense in delaying your retirement!,All due respect !!! Hire a conservative !!! Tradition::: honor and values make up Texas A & M.,You need to close your dog laboratory::: release all the dogs there for adoption into good homes::: and redirect your resources to humane research methods!!! https:// support.peta.org /page/1007/ action/ 1?locale=en-US&u tm_source=PETA% 3A%3AFacebook&u tm_medium=Socia l&utm_campaign= 0820%3A%3Aviv%3 A%3APETA%3A%3AF acebook%3A%3ARI P+Peony+Image+T AMU+AA%3A%3A%3A %3Acaption,Finally!,I hear Jerry Falwell::: Jr. is available!

So happy he’s out of there Wish it was sooner,Let's not wait until May 31::: 2021. How about the effective date of September 2::: 2020.,"President Pussey Resigns!!!! I had been so embarrassed for Texas A&M with this eunoch around. Eunoch = ""a man who has been castrated::: especially (in the past) one employed to guard the women's living areas at an oriental court.""",Can we have our old seal back now?,Hooray!,When you lose the confidence of the majority of the alumni::: have your policy decisions overturned by the Texas state legislature::: and cancel a time honored memorial to the dead children of their parents::: a change in leadership is warranted. I do not celebrate the demise of this president and I do not disparage him personally. I mourn the loss of values::: traditions::: and courage he presided over and what that represents for the future of Texas A&M University. The word respect has been used throughout these comments. Respect is something that is earned and a trust that is held. Through numerous public actions and statements::: it was made clear this president did not respect the history::: heritage::: or generosity of the alumni of the institution he was entrusted to lead and preserve through tumultuous times. Political and public health crises do not form character but they certainly reveal it. Respectfully::: this change was long overdue and we should all hope and pray the next set of shoulders brought in to bear the heavy mantle of history and leadership into the future would be fuller::: broader::: stronger::: and facing the sunrise::: not the sunset on Aggie values and traditions.  Chris Warhurst Class of ‘90,I hope they hire a FORMER AGGIE 👍,Amen! Now time to bring someone back who uphold will our university’s values and Aggie Spirit!,Thank you for your service. Texas A&M needs a strong leader who is capable of making timely decisions. Consensus building is a great concept but generally the issue explodes before the agreement is reached. Wish you well,YES!! THANK GOD. Good riddance. Let's bring back RC Slocum::: Rick Perry or Robert Gates to lead TAMU.,Bring back Dr. Gates,Good riddance.

Sully::: you're fine.,Why wait til May?!,I rather see he’s fired immediately with no tenure nor a teaching position at Bush since his style of “leadership” is more a warning of what not to do when in such a position.👎🏻👎🏻,Thank you for your service and for trying to change the things that need changing,He has not been a good fit for A&M.,Can you leave now though,Hire an old or young AGGIE🎶🎶🎶,Good things piece of s*it who torture dogs,Too bad it wasn’t August 31.🤷🏻‍♀️,Fire Castro!

Some people must think Aggie core values include making hateful comments on forums such as this. I see so many divisive comments about athletes when they make a personal decision that they don’t agree with. “Pull their scholarship”; “good riddance”; “Don’t let the door hit you on the butt as you leave”. Now::: I see some of the same types of comments about President Young. If I were a parent considering colleges for my child and read these kinds of negative comments from alumni and supporters::: I would certainly hesitate to put A&M on the list based upon what I am reading. Prospective athletes are turned off by such negativity too. Honestly::: I think some of you want to drag A&M back to the days of no females allowed::: forced participation in the Corps::: and virtually no minorities on campus. We are a state university that is supposed to serve all students across the state who meet admissions requirements regardless of their race::: gender::: or political beliefs.,You know::: it’s hard enough being at college::: now they have hired/ voluntold various people to walk around and take photos of students who don’t have masks covering their face during WORKOUTS::: campus walk or sitting in the library::: etc. What happened to the 6 foot rule? Aggieland is being run by SJW’s.....haras sing students::: interrupting studying and just general bullying. My daughter being one.....she can’t wait to graduate in December and be done::: it’s not fun anymore::: not aggieland anymore........,once again::: many of my fellow Aggies show their true colors with the vial hatred and vitriol they spew forth upon people::: i'd bet most of you are christians too.... your god offered his other cheek when struck::: y'all would probably pour a 1:::000 rounds into the people your god would only try and help... shame on YOU!,To bad it's a year from now ...you've sucked from the beginning ...move along loser ....,Great man I hate to see him leave 👍,FREE THE DOGS!!!,Jade Chapman,Well...........

This evening::: we will honor eight Aggies who passed away between March and July 2020 with a virtual Silver Taps ceremony. Though the ceremony won’t be in person this semester::: the spirit surrounding the time-honored Aggie tradition remains: http://tx.ag/FallTaps,2020-09-01 14:59:38,Join the Aggie Family tonight in honoring these eight Aggies at 10:30 p.m.: http://tx.ag/ SeptSilverTapsLi ve,Here,Ags::: show up en masse and make the anti-aggie admins send you home!,"Who made this decision? How disappointing A&M has become. People should ""protest"" and show up anyway.",Yeah let's pack 25k people into Kyle for football money but screw our fallen aggies::: they don't get the courtesy of an in-person ceremony.,But they can have football. Very sad and disrespectful to those lost,Here! Class of ‘92,We handle Assignments in all majors 📚🖋️🎓 +447427197456,Thank you for continuing to honor the Aggies who has passed.,Here,I do not understand why this cannot be attended in person. It is outdoors and Ags can wear masks and stay 6' feet apart.,Leave this poor animals!! Stop tormenting them with your experiments! https:// m.facebook.com/ story.php?story_ fbid=1015909814 4114586&id=5647 744585,Here,Here,Here,Here,Ally Lain,You're going to have football games and allow 30% of Kyle Field's capacity for people to come to the games.. yet you won't have in-person Silver Taps to honor our fallen brethren who::: like each of us there::: are pursuing a college education. Maybe it's time to reconsider and re-evaluate the priorities of the school.  And if you say your looking out for the safety of the students::: consider the fact you have the door wide open to having roughly 30:::000 people come together for five games throughout the semester.,Makes no sense for this to be virtual. Why can’t everything just be treated equally?! Foot ball okay. Protest okay. Hell even freshman review was okay! Just get it together already,Virtual Silver Taps seems about as meaningful as a fb like (not the ceremony::: the fact that they are making you only attend virtually). Being there and feeling that silence with your fellow Aggie family. That's an experience you cannot recreate online.,Here.,Here,👍👍👍😢😢❤️❤️,Such a meaningful tradition...💕,Disappointed that this isn’t being held on campus in the traditional fashion. No excuse honestly. Y’all should walk this back ASAP and do them as normal going forward.,Huh::: what about football though? This is a shame...,and if the athletes are allowed to organize a protest with hundreds of kids on campus why not silver taps??😡,Here.,Here,Here for my deceased brother::: John Burttschell Class of 1950.,Rebel. Hold it without administration' s approval (Young should be gone soon anyhow). Covid-19 poses no statistically relevant risk to healthy college kids.,😢,You're destroying Aggie tradition::: one observance at a time.  There is zero reason this couldn't be in person.,🙏🙏🙏🙏,Here,Every time I attended Silver Taps it was outdoors. And could be heard over half of campus. This is nonsense!,Howdy! Can former students join as well?,A&M::: thank you for honoring these fallen Aggies but maintaining the safety of all students. We appreciate your efforts to try to control the spread.,Taps needs to be in person. They deserve that honor.,Nice jester...but::: Y’all are beyond ridiculous!! Bad Bull Ags👎🏻 Live attendance for Aggie football games is allowed and NOT for Taps? #badbull #nottrueAggie #sawemoff,This ceremony should continue the same. Quiet::: keeping distance...But always honoring our great AGGIES....,Here,If we can fit 25:::000 people in Kyle Field::: why can't we find a way to do Silver Taps in person?,Here,Here,This should still be in person. As an outdoors ceremony this could be planned and conducted safely. One more disappointing decision by the current A&M leadership,Beyond disappointed with leadership at TAMU now. They have fought tooth and nail for money-making events (ahem football) but have completely dismissed events that actually reflect the Aggie Spirit and Values. That doesn’t even include how so many other things have been handled this year. We need to do better and hold leadership accountable,Please employ a university president who will uphold Aggie values.👍,The irony to all those out here whining that Silver Taps means nothing unless you can physically stand outside the Academic Building::: is what will they do when we have to mourn the loss of a current Aggie due to COVID-19?!? (And yes::: i know what they’ll do...a) they’ll stay quiet like it didn’t happen::: b) they’ll have forgotten about Silver Taps::: just like they have every other month we lost an Aggie::: except when this one helps their agenda::: or c) they’ll push alternative facts that they didn’t actually die of Covid-19...) I remember when my university had values::: shame so many have thrown those out the window in support of their political affiliations,Here,🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏,Here.,Here,Here...,Here.,Monica Ibarra,here.,Here,Here Class of 75,Here.,Chaney Bell Vincent sad,Here....,Here,Rest in peace,Here,Here,Here Class of 1952,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Texas A&M has launched a COVID-19 dashboard to share data about cases and testing in the Aggie community: tx.ag/COVIDdashboard  Remember::: Aggies: Stay safe and don't pass it back!  TAMU.EDU Texas A&M University COVID-19 Reporting Data - Texas A&M University::: College Station::: TX,2020-08-27 22:02:14,Its not the mask 😷 its the people in dorms and careless kiddos.,Sara Wood,Leave this poor animals!! Stop tormenting them with your experiments! https:// m.facebook.com/ story.php?story_ fbid=1015909814 4114586&id=5647 744585,It's shouldn't be necessarily about positive cases. It should be about how many of these cases are really sick. Just because your positive doesn't mean your ill.,Please add recovered cases to the total.,What's the impact on the local hospitals? What's the demographics of the cases and deaths?  The point of masks and social distancing is to keep hospitals from being overwhelmed::: and the dashboard doesn't give much useful information.,Just get on with providing the education that has been paid for and leave the politics out of it. We dont need another dashboard to track a virus.,Who cares. Cases don’t matter. Virus is in decline and will follow the same path of all previous viral outbreaks. No stopping it once it’s out. Get on with life.,All this mask wearing and cases are still climbing. 🤔,Stop with the random testing! If they don’t have symptoms the don’t need to be tested!,Stop with the BS already please.,Hate where Ags are going on many levels,In the latest TAMU COVID dashboard::: the weekly number of positive cases says that it went down (358 the week of Aug 16 vs. 290 the week of Aug 23)::: but if you add up the daily numbers Aug 23-28::: the number of positive cases went up (383 vs. 329 from Aug 16-22). Why is there a difference?,That dashboard is lol. Conflicts with Brazos country and should be taken down,Sad,NEW YORK TIMES: UP TO 90% OF PEOPLE WITH “POSITIVE” COVID TEST RESULTS AREN’T INFECTIOUS by Kevin Ryan  “Your Coronavirus Test Is Positive. Maybe It Shouldn’t Be.”  That’s the title of a New York Times article today that has very significant implications for COVID policy moving forward.  “The standard tests are diagnosing huge numbers of people who may be carrying relatively insignificant amounts of the virus. Most of these people are not likely to be contagious:::” the New York Times writes.  “The tests being used are too sensitive::: meaning they pick up even tiny fragments of virus that do not indicate a person is actually meaningfully infected.”  Indeed an investigation by the newspaper finds that up to 90% of positive test results are in people who are not infectious.  THE EXPLANATION  The PCR test searches for the virus by amplifying virus materials::: essentially growing them in amplification “cycles” until they are detectable. The smaller the amount of virus::: the more cycles are needed to detect it.  Often the test uses so many amplification cycles that even the tiniest genetic fragments – leftovers from infection that pose no risk whatsoever – trigger positive test results.  And the test result merely returns “Positive” or “Negative”::: with no indication of how much virus was found::: or how many amplification cycles were needed to find the virus (called the cycle threshold).  THE PROBLEM  A test result that simply says positive or negative “isn’t good enough” according the doctors interviewed for the New York Times article. It’s the AMOUNT of virus found that should dictate whether the test result should be categorized as positive::: and what the patient should do next.  “It’s really irresponsible:::” Dr. Michael Mina::: an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. “We’ve been using one type of data for everything::: and that is just plus or minus — that’s all. We’re using that for clinical diagnostics::: for public health::: for policy decision-making .”  “It’s just kind of mind-blowing to me… that they’re just returning a positive or a negative:::” said Angela Rasmussen::: a virologist at Columbia University in New York. “It would be useful information to know if somebody’s positive::: whether they have a high viral load or a low viral load:::” she added.  Just how many of the “positive” test results are from patients who have so little virus that they aren’t infectious?  The New York Times reviewed three sets of testing data from Massachusetts::: New York::: and Nevada. It found that 90% of people who tested “positive” carried barely any virus.  If that rate holds true for the entire county::: it would mean that the United States has far fewer actual infectious cases of COVID than is being reported.  “On Thursday::: the United States recorded 45:::604 new coronavirus cases::: according to a database maintained by The Times. If the rates of contagiousness in Massachusetts and New York were to apply nationwide::: then perhaps only 4:::500 of those people may actually need to isolate and submit to contact tracing:::” the Times wrote.  Experts informed of these numbers were stunned.  “I’m shocked that people would think that [such small amounts of virus] could represent a positive:::” Juliet Morrison::: a virologist at the University of California::: Riverside::: said.  “I would say that none of those people should be contact-traced::: not one:::” Dr. Mina said.  The number of people with positive results who aren’t infectious is particularly concerning::: said Scott Becker::: executive director of the Association of Public Health Laboratories. “That worries me a lot.”  “I’m really shocked” Dr. Ashish Jha::: director of the Harvard Global Health Institute::: agreed. “Boy::: does it really change the way we need to be thinking about testing.”  THE IMPLICATIONS  Just yesterday::: California revamped its criteria for reopening businesses::: basing it on how many positive test results a county has instead of hospitalization s::: and setting the bar incredibly low. Just 1 new positive test per day out of 15:::000 residents now keeps a county at the strictest level where nearly all businesses are shut down or heavily restricted.  But today’s revelation by the New York Times shows that such a move will essentially keep the state permanently locked down with little regard for how many of those positive test results are actually from infectious Californians::: and how many are from overly sensitive PCR tests.  Indeed::: most of the case-based measurements that the media has been using to gauge how the states are doing at controlling COVID may now be all but meaningless in light of the New York Times data.  Also::: comparing the summer “surge” in some states to the spring outbreak is also now less meaningful. In the spring::: only symptomatic people were being tested. Symptomatic people are those who have the highest viral loads::: and therefore did not need a lot of “amplification” in their tests to result in a positive test.  But in the summer::: the guidelines switched to testing more people::: including those who were not symptomatic. This likely resulted in significantly more “positive” results from non-infectious patients.  THE SOLUTION  One solution would be to adjust the cycle threshold used to decide if a patient is infected. Most tests set the limit at 40. “Any test with a cycle threshold above 35 is too sensitive” scientists interviewed by the Times agreed. Dr. Mina said he would set the figure at 30::: or even less.  From 70% to 90% of tests would no longer be judged positive if the amplification cycles were limited to 30::: according to the Times.  And less sensitive::: rapid tests should be used to verify positive PCR results::: Dr. Mina said.  “In what may be a step in this direction::: the Trump administration announced on Thursday that it would purchase 150 million rapid tests:::” the New York Times article said.

Texas A&M’s efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19 includes a random testing program::: created in collaboration with Texas A&M Student Health Services::: Texas A&M School of Public Health::: and Johns Hopkins University.  Selected students will be asked to take a free::: self-administered saliva test and will receive results within 48 hours. Read more about the program: http://tx.ag/RandomTestingProgram,2020-08-25 19:43:02,How can they tell a student that they are offering no in-person classes to that they now have to go stand in line at a testing center with potentially sick students to get tested. And what are the consequences of refusing the test?? I have seen no answer to that question yet. Very frustrating as a parent to be paying full tuition and fees and for my students to have no in person classes::: no places to go study ::: and now be told they have to get out of their apartment to go be tested.,Asking a student to take a Covid test is one thing. But sending them to Buetel::: where the medical staff thinks every student has mono or an STD is something different.

Very Bad Optics & PR for students::: tuition paying parents & former students,My daughter went to the tent today after getting her email for random testing. She scheduled it::: and showed up. When she arrived there were about 40-50 people inside the tent::: a line outside::: and then was asked to cough 5 times before they swabbed her mouth. She said she was scared she contracted COVID inside the tent due to everyone coughing!! Why in the world would this be done inside a tent near so many others? It makes no sense.

There Are Some Real Jerks Commenting Here.. Not Very good Aggie Attitudes.. 😪,Mark Walston,Professional Sports should give us a pretty clear understanding of Covid 19 and it’s lethality.

Texas A&M announces student COVID-19 Random Testing Program: tx.ag/RTPnote,2020-08-20 23:20:33,Nope. My kid is not doing it. You can not mandate testing.,Can we talk about the ethics of conducting research on human subjects through coercion::: or have we skipped that part?,What happens to a student if they refuse? Is there any guidance on this or consequences listed? I could not find any.,I would have no issue with this if it was required upon arriving to back to campus and required for all. But to now tell them its a random requirement is crap. Its wrong on many levels.,You have lost your ever-loving mind. Bad bull.,Great! Try to locate infected persons before they spread it. I appreciate this effort.,Well well well::: if this is the case i want my child back home she is already doing online classes. But you guys couldn’t cancel her contract for the apartment!!!! I swear I’ll put 3 attorneys on your ASSES if this is the case!!!!,People acting like they’re asking you to chop off an arm. Come on Ags::: be better than that.,This would be the opposite of “Whoop!” Bad Ags 👎,Is this being done to all CS residents or just students? Testing is voluntary ...that was our understanding when deciding come on board. Did that change??,Either this or shut the doors. Good to see the school is trying to be proactive versus hoping and praying the virus doesn’t spread. 👍,I graduated from TAMU in 2011::: so its been a while since I've actually attended. Considering the comments I'm seeing::: it seems like a lot has changed. When I was a student::: we took off our hats in the MSC::: we didn't walk on the grass around it::: or cheer when opponents were injured on the field. I gave up many nights to remember my fellow Ags at Silver Taps::: Muster::: and Bonfire anniversary.  Maybe your experience was different than mine::: but my time there taught me the importance of thinking of your fellow Ag before my own comforts::: wants::: and needs. I'm not afraid of COVID-19's impact on myself::: but I understand that many of the faculty and staff are concerned and that many students that look fine may be immuno-compromi sed. Students go home to families with older or unhealthy members. I have to think of them when I go about my day::: not just myself.  We need to get back to work. TAMU needs to open its door and have in-person classes as much as possible. TAMU is making reasonable steps to do this::: but is asking students to think of others::: not just themselves. How is that not the epitome of being an Aggie?,Online only classes by September given these comments.,It’s amazing how hostile and irresponsible folks are on this page. Testing is a key::: critical component of knowing prevalence of the disease and its subsequent control. The a University is behaving capable::: competent and responsible.,This is intrusive and violates all personal freedoms. Where does it stop! Forced vaccinations are next,This makes me furious! Complete removal of freedom and an invasion of privacy. No coincidence that the announcement came AFTER tuition came due.,Whatever happened to HIPPA much less the Constitution? How can you simply demand someone’s DNA and bodily fluids? Where are the privacy protections for the testees? I recommend students IGNORE the email.,Young adult of reasonable health are not at risk::: just parents::: parents please be aware when your child comes home that they may be contagious without symptoms.,My kid tested positive and only symptom is loss of taste & smell. No fever::: no respiratory problems::: but still must quarantine... He's crazy bored::: hunger and lonely. He's a freshman and having trouble finding the zoom cites::: assignments and online books...,Considering a majority of asymptomatic people are of the same age group of undergraduates::: this is important to the Aggie community! If you want in person classes this is a must.,Absolutely not! We don’t pay tuition for you to test our kids that aren’t sick. We pay tuition for you to “educate”,Not sure how I feel about this.... What if you refuse? This seems like a big invasion of their rights...,Random? I'm sure that violates a person's rights.,I see lawsuits in your future. Bad bull.,Testing for something that is virtually impossible for that age group to die from? This is an overreach of epic proportions. Seems like maybe this was timed until they were all back on campus::: and not before.,In a month it’ll be forced vaccinations.,Seems like a total waste of money. Use the testing kits for folks who have symptoms!!!,To everyone confidently stating that the cases are minor for people the age of a typical college student::: why are you against this?  If you're right::: it provides more solid data to help your case. If you're wrong::: we understand more about the virus and how to better combat it. It's a win-win.,What is accomplished by random COVID testing? Are they trying to discourage students from getting COVID for fear of being caught? Drug testing works that way::: COVID testing doesn't. I don't get it. I'm all for testing those who are sick or in close contact::: but RANDOM testing??? Seems like a giant waste of resources that would be better spent on targeted testing::: contact tracing::: and remote learning infrastructure.,Random...like urinalysis? Simply wow. How far the Aggies have fallen.,You cannot force people to be tested.,These comments are terrifying and hilarious at the same time. Anyone care to guess how many colleges and universities required testing before returning to campus?? For a place that prides itself on being a center of research::: I’m appalled at the number of whack-a-doos getting panties in a wad over our school conducting research. FFS!!!!!!,I really don’t understand how getting a swab up your nose is going to ruin student experiences and why it’s even an issue.....,No way would I allow that of my child.,As an Aggie who earned my BS at A&M and truly loved my experience there ::: I’m saddened by some these comments. The motto where I obtained my PhD is Ut Prosim::: that I may serve. I thought that was so cool cuz it reminded me of the Aggie Spirit - As a. Example::: always greet with a Howdy cuz you care about others. Aggies are better than some of the comments I see here. Be socially responsible - Greet with a Howdy under that mask; Greet with a Howdy even when physically distancing; when you get tested::: give your tester a friendly Howdy. It’s what we do.,Great initiative! I would happily take this minor discomfort to protect my fellow researchers and colleagues. As an Aggie::: I welcome this step.,That is just gonna spread irrational fear. There are so many false positives plus even the common cold will show a positive result. Hospitalization s are going down::: focus on that,FAQ that isn't included: what if I don't want to participate?,The problem is 50% are false results.,Excellent initiative to ensure everyone’s safety. It is a public health initiative which has got nothing to do with anyone’s freedom. How selfish do you have to be to react as if someone’s asking you to chop off your arm!,Email the president with concerns. I believe this is a misuse of money! They test::: go to grocery store::: get Covid::: get negative test results thinking it’s not Covid and continue going to campus. It’s a false sense of security and imo violates rights. Email PresidentYoung@ tamu.edu,When and how was this condition of in person classes communicated to the students?,I wonder if the A&M administration reviews facebook comments and gets that aha moment from someones comments and says we should now do this instead of that. The amount of bickering is disheartening.,I am really surprised at all you Aggie bellyachers. Let's beat this damn thing. Y'all are like the guy invited to the potluck who brings a personal bag of chips as his side. If you want to participate in society in these times don't endanger others. Common courtesy.,Quit complaining. Everyone here are Aggies::: rough stuff & are better than griping and complaining about Our University doing everything possible to keep students & employees safe & healthy.,People need to stop thinking about themselves!!! Students don’t die from covid-19 fine::: but what about the faculty that is servicing them and the staff?,I have a son at University of Kentucky and they are requiring testing of all 30000 of their students. It’s also a public University and there is nobody complaining about it. The positive cases are quarantined to prevent spread and everyone is trying to cooperate so we can push forward with some more normalcy. This is a positive thing::: having real data can only help.,Saliva tests are not accurate. Too many false positives. The nasopharyngeal approach has demonstrated to be the most accurate method of collection.,Whether you agree with this or not::: it is a violation of one’s personal freedoms that are guaranteed by the Constitution. This is not free education::: tuition is supposed to be used for educational purposes. What will happen when a student refuses to test??,As a former student athlete- we were all subject to random drug tests.... incase you don’t understand... that is peeing in a cup while actually being watched::: not behind a door . I don’t see the fuss y’all. Besides::: one of our Aggies may have super human immune cells that might be helpful,Things have clearly changed dramatically in 15 years. While I think it is great the university is looking at ways to keep students safe::: it does not appear to mention in the post if it is voluntary or if there is any kind of opt out. Also::: what happens if a student does refuse to schedule their appointment? I guess when the federal government decided A&M would be a good location to make the vaccine::: now forced bureaucracy comes with that. It seems like instead of “random” it would make more sense to say anyone who wants to live in the dorms for example needs to have a test.,Bad bull!! Mandatory medical testing not previously agreed to::: such as employees agree to random drug tests. Seems to be an infringement of civil rights. And::: there are False Positives!!,Random testing for the rona? Thats the stupidest shit ive heardin a lomg time. Who the hell is running the show at our school now?,4th Amendment anyone? How can a state univ compel any involuntary medical tests?,I’ve been told by a hospital lab tech in my home town::: Arlington::: that they have to send some samples out of house for testing because it’s still hard to get certain COVID tests. So how does TAMU justify “random” testing??,This is ridiculous. The university has no right to randomly test students. Unfortunately::: it seems to have been taken over by leftists in the last few years. Dr. Young needs to go.,Although I don't totally disagree::: I worry that they will find a lot more positives than expected::: freak out like chicken little that the sky is falling::: then shut it all down and send everyone home. There are going to be college kids::: a lot of them::: who test positive. Isolate it::: treat it::: and street it! Keep these kids at school and carry on. Most of them are online anyway so the only heavy exposure is in private gatherings. I don't think sending everyone home is the right answer.,One of Texas A&M University’s core values is Integrity: when was the random testing first discussed and why did students not know until second day of school? We cannot /should not fix a dreadful situation by doing the wrong thing. Transparency is::: in my opinion::: essential.,This is wrong on SO many levels! This is unlawful. This is a violation of privacy. This HAS to STOP!,You people are getting all worked up over a freaking salvia test::: while Texas A&M continues to torture golden retrievers for muscular dystrophy. YOU are the sick ones.,I fail to see how you could equate random testing with poor leadership.,They cannot force a student to be tested for Covid anymore than they can force a pregnant female student to undergo an abortion. What the hell is going on at this school.,This is my daughter's first year at TAMU and we are excited and proud for her to be an Aggie Engineer. I understand the need for testing::: but this program is not the answer. If students want to sign up to be tested::: go right ahead::: but the school has no right to require students to participate in the testing. I hope those students who do not want to participate but who are selected stand up and say no::: and I hope the school will respect them and ask for volunteers.,Here’s an alternative::: which I think makes more sense:  Why waste money on a test if the person hasn’t exhibited any symptoms? It should be random COVID-19 screening. Even though the test is technically free for us::: the money is coming from somewhere and I would hate to see that being wasted on a test that wasn’t needed. There should be two steps. First step is Q and A. If the answers lead to a possible case of COVID-19 then I wholeheartedly agree that the individual should get tested. Thanks and Gig’Em,My student does all classes online::: not going to get tested because the school says so.,Release the dogs in your failed muscular dystrophy lab 💔 ⁣These experiments are cruel and you obviously will never find a cure. It's been 40 years!!,Students pay thousands for tuition and all that jazz and y’all just violate their freedom and invade their privacy... test the individuals with symptoms not student that are sitting in their apartments all day because they can’t cancel their lease!!!🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️,"This abuse of the term ""selfless service"" is a manipulation of the students.","This was approved this week and likely why your University has implemented this testing strategy. The first wave of testing according to their documents will be ""at least 5:::000 students"" and ""will continue throughout the semester with new batches of COVID tests being delivered on a regular basis. Since students are chosen randomly::: it is probable a student could be tested more than once. There is a section on the Student Health Services Page titled Patient Rights and Privacy. There you will find your rights or your student's rights. 1. Right to refuse treatment 2. Right to refuse to participate in research https:// www.livescience. com/ covid-19-saliva- test-yale.html",Wait til they are all done bitching about this and they are bitching about the university closing and all classes going online. It’s always something.,This is just an example of government overreach. My child will NOT be participating!,Can someone verify if this is mandatory if selected? The way I read the email was this was “participation” if selected. I’ve emailed and no response.,Also parents a physician has to order all of these tests. How are they getting around that? Perhaps bc this is part of a lab experiment?,This is crazy. Either require all students to be tested before they return to campus or only test students that have symptoms.,People without symptoms willingly getting tested with a test notorious for giving false positives...... Did the person who implemented this policy graduate from A&M? Bad example for the students. You should be ashamed. Follow the money guys.,I have emailed my question and am waiting for a response::: but does anyone here know which test they are using? Antigen or acute infection?,Where are the conservatives? This mandatory testing is an outrage! The Democratics say “my life::: my body”!!! Well::: as a conservative republican::: I say::: “ my life::: my body”! Don’t tread on me. Wake up!,Unenforceable on so many levels::: just like the mask agenda.... Good luck testing me. I’m not going to get falsely tested when I am not ill and have to be quarantined for 14 days. Not me::: I have a life to live. If you don’t need to get sick::: stay at home::: wear a mask::: I don’t care. Just don’t force your unconstitutiona l agenda on me. Shame on Texas A&M for leaning liberal and not having a backbone. Show me a piece of *scientific* evidence (besides a cartoon infographic) proving masks work. I’ll wait.,There are countries that recognize the importance of working together so EVERYONE is safe. Why is this so difficult?,My daughter goes to Baylor (A&M doesn’t offer her major) and they tested ALL students ahead of classes beginning.,How is this not a 4th amendment violation? There is NO WAY I would consent to this. Please don’t make me rethink sending my son there in a few years. You are becoming an organization I don’t recognize any more.,Absolutely not. I am responsible. I am a non traditional student who understands rules::: regulations::: and rights. Force me...,If someone is not sick::: there is no reason to be forced to take a virus test. Slippery road to totalitarianism ::: or in the case of one political philosophy::: intolerantarian ism.,I don’t understand how we can all call ourselves Aggies::: but we can turn around and be so hateful to each other. Agree to disagree::: and move on.,You’re not swabbing my daughter for no good reason!!! You will have a lawsuit to deal with.,^these comments are so disappointing. they’re testing people because lots of people are asymptomatic and can bring it on campus without knowing. then it’ll spread and make it even more of an issue. good job TAMU! 👍🏻,How exactly do y'all plan on enforcing that?,Seems like an invasion of their privacy. Is there a legal basis for forcing this on students?,Is this what “Vision 2020” was supposed to be back when I was a student?,Way to lead Ags! Salute and Mask up,You have a warrant for that test?,Have the tests become more reliable? Or is the false positive rate still making it a completely worthless test?,STOP funding experiments on dogs. Disgusting that this goes on in your university. Let the dogs out that you are using to test on.,As a parent::: I want to know if this is voluntary or mandatory. If my student somehow ended up selected::: is there an opt out option?,People comparing this to random drug testing are missing a big difference. When you play a sport or hire on at a job::: you are doing so knowing BEFORE THE FACT that you will be subject to taking random drug tests. The university waited until AFTER kids moved back::: AFTER classes began::: AFTER money has been exchanged to notify students and parents. I am a former student::: 12th Man donor::: season ticket holder::: Aggie mom and Aggie aunt and I have never been so disappointed in “my school” as I have been the past few months. And this was the last straw. What is to stop a student who tests negative to then go out to get groceries::: contract COVID unknowingly with no systems::: and then spread it to students who may or may not have been tested yet?

Did anyone else get theirs?,There are so many incorrect results being given from the testing that the testing can’t be trusted. Why be locked down and quarantined for a faulty test? Just use the 6 foot rule and masks::: why keep adding more and more restrictions. Some of the tests were contaminated w/ the virus. Don’t think this is a good idea at all. Come on A&M.,COVID tests use the PCR process invented by Kary Mullis. He noted the PCR test should never be used as a tool in “the diagnosis of infectious diseases.”  Jason Hommel notes….  “PCR basically takes a sample of your cells and amplifies any DNA to look for ‘viral sequences’::: i.e. bits of non-human DNA that seem to match parts of a known viral genome. The problem is the test is known not to work. It uses ‘amplification’ which means taking a very very tiny amount of DNA and growing it exponentially until it can be analysed. Obviously any minute contaminations in the sample will also be amplified leading to potentially gross errors of discovery. Additionally::: it’s only looking for partial viral sequences::: not whole genomes::: so identifying a single pathogen is next to impossible even if you ignore the other issues.The idea these kits can isolate a specific virus like COVID-19 is nonsense.”  Dr. David Rasnick::: bio-chemist::: protease developer and former founder of an EM lab called Viral Forensics stated….  “PCR for diagnosis is a big problem. When you have to amplify it these huge numbers of time::: it’s going to generate massive amounts of false positives. Again::: I’m skeptical that a PCR test is ever true.”,U will not make nor force my child to test... and if you want her out send her home she will do online classes at my house but you will terminate her 65 pages contract!!!!

A positive PCR test does not necessarily mean an infected/ contagious person. We have never tested healthy people before this particular virus and called them “cases”. The flu is also largely asymptomatic (possibly up to 75%). Imagine the fear and harm if we went around testing healthy people and finding all those extra “cases” and requiring them to quarantine. This virus dies out when about 20% of the population has contracted it (scientists believe 50% have T cell immunity). Masks and testing healthy people are not going to change the end result::: just delay it.,Lauryn Valdez,So Nazi experiments continue,I had it. Tested positive. I'm 56. Was like a cold only easier.

Secondly::: you::: as a parent::: sold your child’s privacy to a hundred devils the minute you got them their first cell phone and laptop::: but you never seem to cry foul about that. TAMU is a proud R1 research university::: and you should be proud and pleased they care enough about each student and staff member to want to be proactive and ahead of the game to protect everyone who attends and works there.

Who's gonna be liable if a student gets hurt or sues because the test was REALLY uncomfortable ( if done correctly). #3 FYI....The CDC recommendations for all healthcare providers that have tested POSITIVE? A) If asymptomatic ( NO symptoms but research proves these people are still contagious)requ ired to report to work with a mask ( not an N95) & allowed to treat ALL PATIENTS ( Non Covid patients included ; no legal requirement to disclose any employee information to the patient) B) If symptomatic- may return to work once symptom free ( not 2 weeks) #4 Testing positive DOES not mean you will get sick (more people are ASYMPTOMATIC... never have symptoms) The public has been exposed to HCPs who are Covid + since the beginning. If it is safe for me to put on a regular mask while being Covid + & take care of ALL my patients it should be good enough for the general public.

I think it’s important to be up front and honest where they see cases to help prevent more exposure and don’t see it at all as a strike against any organization that see cases.

Thanks A&M for your efforts in trying to keep our kids safe♥️,Thank you from a class of '82 former student. I hope my son will be joining the class of 25 next Fall. I appreciate TAMU with its medical school::: nursing school::: medical allied programs and related life sciences. This update shows an educated and cooperative and plan with community representatives . The plan needs to keep the curve flattened. Ask folks in Houston::: Corpus Christi and south Texas. Texans have shown we can be successful. The evidence can be seen in data from late April. The new variable is the density of people at our schools and universities. We have already seen what happens when people relax the needed behaviors to keep the curve flattened during late June through the month of July. Some the most successful improvements in medicine comes from individuals' attitudes and behaviors. Ags show respect::: responsibility::: and scholarship toward other the health of all Ags and the surrounding community by having a caring and humble attitude and by practicing the behaviors that will keep each other safe. I know TAMU has what it takes to show the rest of Texas how it is done!

Texas A&M Office of the President August 20::: 2020 at 10:57 AM ·  “If we’re going to ever be able to get back to our normal daily lives::: we must cover our faces and avoid groups of more than 10 outside the classroom. I think we can all agree that doing so is a small price to pay.” - MKY  Watch President Young's full address to the campus community.,2020-08-20 17:00:10,Bring back R.Bowen,This is what is happening to your students as they will be used for a lab experiment. https:// today.tamu.edu/ 2020/07/27/ college-station- bio-manufacturi ng-center-to-pr oduce-covid-19- vaccines/,What is special about a classroom such that gatherings of >10 are safe there?,"I did not like when he said ""this place""! Really Aggieland say it!",Please::: TAKE ACTION below and let TAMU know that it's time to release the dogs from the MD laboratory. https:// support.peta.org /page/16336/ action/ 1?locale=en-US,I grew up loving Texas A&M from my father's influence. He was a graduate of 1952 in Mechanical Engineering. My father submitted my photograph to the yearbook at the time and there I am giving a big Aggie cheer in my little Aggie sweater. When I graduated from high school in 1966 women were not yet allowed at the university or I too would have been an A&M graduate. My daughter and her husband graduated from A&M in the early 1990s. Now I have two grandsons there who will graduate in December and May respectively with engineering degrees. I am a teacher who has attended many A&M graduations of my former students. I love Texas A&M. Thank you President Young for looking after the students and demonstrating such a caring attitude toward them. Also thank you for listening the the concerns of the students. You continue the tradition of honor that has been a hallmark of the university. I would ask those of you who are making ugly comments to consider that perhaps you may have lost some of the Spirit of Aggieland. The Aggies that I have known stick together in a loving spirit.,Science tell people to stop living and enjoying their lives? If you do you are already dead,Thanks Mr. Young for following public health recommendations and helping reduce the spread of Covid19. Childish students will complain but that's normal. Great job.,This guy can't be gone from A&M fast enough...,No leadership. Ignoring data. Go away.,TMAU needs a more CONSERVATIVE LEADER who will preserve TAMU's culture & traditions.,I hope TAMU takes this into account but COVID cases are its lowest in two months and restrictions could be eased a little. More spots to sit in the Flag Room would be greatly appreciated 👍,Great job Texas A&M! My daughter is a Senior 2021! Whoop! I feel a lot better that these precautions are being taken! She also works at HEB. And they are doing a great job too. Let’s be safe until this virus is controlled!,Get this guy out of there. He’s ruining our great university.,Killers shut the dog lab down,No truer words are spoken by the President of A And M! Please::: everyone heed to his remarks and be the Perfect Aggie that we all look up to.🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻,To all the beautiful labs bred at a&m university::: I pray God will stop the torture soon. Picture of a broken dog! Wish you could have known that life was better than this. Shameful to be a human. Please stop this unnecessary torture. If animals could talk humanity would cry! God did not give us animals to mutilate and torture.,Get rid of the Corona virus and commies.,When is he leaving....,I would think no one would want a large breakout of COVID at A&M. I have never seen such negative::: hateful comments on an A&M post. Let’s pull together,Everyone is so quick to judge::: ridicule::: and disrespect the good initiatives. People that can't give good things only have negative opinions about everything. Disrespectful unhappy people that don't care about anyone but themselves. I support any initiative that will help students and staff stay healthy. Why not? Is your pretty face hiding behind that mask? Or are you letting your true colors shine without the mask? Some people will not wear the mask and keep a safe distance because they were never thought to think about others.,Despite many idiots think this pandemic is a hoax or believe that we will be ok if everyone is exposed to the virus::: Dr. Young we appreciate what you do to protect our children and change made to better our beloved school. Class’ 87 and father of Class’ 19 & 20,I think it’s a small price to pay to get a new president who truly understands what it means to be an Aggie and to support those core values.,There’s a remedy for the virus! Stop dragging out this soap opera. The jig is up.,Why doesn’t Texas A@M have a COVID-19 live dashboard ???,Aggies looking after other Aggies by wearing a simple mask. Seems easy and reasonable enough given all the other::: much more difficult::: feats Aggies have accomplished to make the institution the finest on the planet.  I applaud the administration’ s efforts in keeping the student body and surrounding community a bit safer and healthier during the ongoing pandemic.,And they die from other diseases as well. What are you doing to safeguard the students from those diseases or others Mike?,Down with this clown .....,I didn’t expect TAMU to ignore science and invite students to live on campus. Soon you are going to face outbreaks and you are held responsible 😢,It’s probably too late for this advice. Did you see the crowd at Whataburger on the night before classes started?,SHUT DOWN YOUR DOG LAB. THIS IS SO CRUEL💔,Unless it’s a college football day::: where your letting 55:::000 people gather in a stadium!

Especially from former students. Our political leanings should not be the focus here. I envisioned my daughter being Class of 2038::: but things need to change with the tone and undercurrents. As a third generation Aggie::: I can say that I am really disappointed.,This guy is a joke and needs to be removed.,You say that Aggies are always respectful. I would hope so::: but maybe you haven’t seen the chalking and defacing of campus by the Anti-Sully few. Chalking hate and a racist moniker on the seal at Military Walk. This is vandalism and not respectful of the university or the students.,One of my son’s professors is posting you tube videos for the instruction time. It’s not even a virtual live forum. We were told classes would be in person once a week or virtual instruction; this is not the case. Very disappointed.,Great reminder to everyone!

My daughter has only one “in person” class. The first day of school her professor tells the class that he can’t believe they are even there! That because of them Aggies will die! Really?!! I believe that our students should have the right to attend in person classes. If there are students that don’t feel comfortable they can do online.,College aged kids have an even lower chance of dying from Covid than from dying from the flu...

Was he punished? Are the Marxists who continuously undermine Aggie values and traditions by damaging property punished to the fullest extent of the law? Why is it that college students maintaining their mental health by spending time with close friends worthy of shaming by our president publicly on video but tangible criminal activity on campus is routinely ignored?,How about you take a look at your racist professor’s FB post and get rid of him? I don’t want my child being indoctrinated into this socialism nonsense while I’m paying for tuition at TAMU!,So what’s the endgame here? Masks forever?

A&M should be focused on how best to keep people learning through the pandemic vs creating high risk environments for Covid spread. Putting money over people’s safety is going to turn Aggieland into Covidland pretty quick. There’s a reason conferences::: concerts::: and other events are not happening. If the NBA doesn’t view it safe to hold fans in the stands why do you think this is safe?,Rachel Friedman,I agree I have a senior and they need to be able to go,Brady Manning,Refund coming,I’m confused...so we have games with limited capacity::: open rush week for pledges::: but cannot hold Silver Taps???,Money over people’s lives ... disappointed but not surprised,Let the students have the tickets.

THIS IS SO CRUEL💔,Mary Kathryn Ashley,Our family will no longer hold season football tickets or even watch A&M football games. While many student athletes are proud to represent Texas A&M::: Mond and a few other student athletes have been videod on campus threatening old Ags and insulting all Aggie Alumni who pay for their scholarships. These entitled and terribly behaved athletes are an embarrassment to Aggies everywhere.  We will always tune in and support the Fightin Texas Aggie band::: who represent Aggies and The Spirit of Aggieland.  Scholarships recipients should be held to the Aggie code of conduct::: and those who can't should lose their scholarship and the privilege of attending Texas A&M University. A few badly behaved and entitled student athletes have already cost Texas A&M Universit MILLIONS in lost almuni donations. Alumni will be heard.,Can’t live in fear.,Whoop!,Masks save lives though! Pack Kyle Field!!,Chase Bieri,Charmiane Garza Beto Garza,Joe Williamson Margaret Williamson,Matthew Bartek,Noel Neely,So it’s safe to have 30:::000 people in Kyle Field::: but you have to cancel Silver Taps.

What say you Texas A&M University/12th Man Foundation/The Association of Former Students?,“Now forming at the North end of Kyle Field........ oh forget it nobody’s actually forming!” ....... actually that’s kinda sad.,This is a difficult year.

I wonder if classes will even continue in person instruction.,Ridiculous,Yes💪🏼🇺🇸,It’s bull the way y’all do season tickets anyways. No one with a normal paying job can afford them anymore.

Sad day in Aggieland.,Jessica Guerrero,Cancel the football season.  A Washington Post article even says the Coronavirus could cause lasting heart complications for athletes. From the article:  “60% of those who recover from Covid-19::: even those with mild or no symptoms at all::: have myocarditis afterwards.

The tradition of Silver Taps::: the student body's final tribute paid to an Aggie who at the time of their death was an enrolled student at Texas A&M::: will transition to a virtual event for the fall semester for all to safely observe online.  The broadcast will be delivered on KAMU Public Broadcasting::: along with Texas A&M's Instagram and Facebook page. The first virtual Silver Taps will be Tuesday::: Sept. 1st at 10:30 p.m. and will honor eight fallen Aggies: tx.ag/VirtualSilverTaps,2020-08-17 19:36:44,But yet football with fans in the stands. 🤬,It seems ironic that my university is bending over backwards to figure out how to put as many people in Kyle Field seats for football but has punted on figuring out one of the most culturally critical traditions at A&M. Very disappointed in the leadership’s efforts.,So Silver Taps is more risky than football or in-person classes? Bad bull.,I am disappointed in my university. I thought that we stood for the greater good. These posts don't reflect that. I know I will get hate piled on. This is all about protecting Aggies::: the University::: and the community. I could not be more disappointed.,No. This is unacceptable. They’ll be fine outside and distanced. I’m ashamed of this decision.,Wow::: when did Texas A&M become a school of pansies? Such a decorated history. Our military founders wouldn’t recognize this cotton bunny bunch today.,Pitiful. I guess the only in person events important enough for TAMU to push to hold are those that make money for the university; all other traditions and events will be pushed to the wayside because it will save them money while they hide behind this virus.,I wish Young & Sharp would read these comments. Actually::: I wish they cared. If we can have football::: we can have Silver Taps!,Making this virtual is a terrible idea.☹️,If having Taps virtually this month can prevent one-fewer student’s name from being added next month::: it’s worth it. Life will always outweigh tradition.,As an Aggie Parent overseas I personally applaud this decision and hope it will continue as it will enable ALL of the Aggie community to be able to join in love and respect to honour Aggies.  The virtual Muster ceremony was amazingly poignant and it was so special being able to “attend”.  Thank you TAMU 🙏🏼  Here - in Singapore,Totally ridiculous!! Total joke and disrespect...es pecially since students are attending classes on campus and spectators will be allowed at football games😬😷#badbull #worstaggiejokee ver,Not sure I understand this. Silver Taps is one of the traditions that can easily observe social distance. It’s outside! Guess it’s easier when it doesn’t bring in revenue. Just saying.,So disappointed in this decision.,One of many reasons I’ve stopped donating to the The Association of Former Students. The main was receiving quite literally dozens of phone calls in one day last year from student workers who thought it’d be funny to harass donors. I filed a harassment complaint::: and did receive an apology from someone high up in the Association::: but none of the offenders were terminated. This is just another brick in the wall. Texas A&M University needs to do better. It’s lost it’s way::: and most VPs probably can’t name all 8 Uniformed Services::: let alone identify a member’s rank insignia. It’s shameful.  TAMC former students volunteer to put themselves in harm’s way every day to protect this country. Students should be provided the opportunity to risk a cough to honor them. Seems easy to me.  Canceling Silver Taps is tone deaf at best::: thinly veiled Vietnam-era shaming at worse.,I think this post should be focused on the eight lives lost and honoring them. If you want to discuss decisions of the university let’s take that elsewhere. Prayers for the families and friends of the eight Aggies list who we honor with Silver Taps.,Why couldn’t family members be allowed to attend in person?,"While I like the idea of a livestream of it::: there should still be atleast friends/family present for each person::: kinda like ""Here"" at Muster. I echo what another said about it really being the whole experience and not just the music itself. It was a good moment walking back acrosa campus in the silence and dark to comtemplate mortality and what life means.",Fight changing tradition - no student die this semester,Please respect the difficult decisions being made to keep people safe. We don’t need any more Silver Taps ceremonies borne out of crowds gathering for any reason. Silver Taps is sacred. It will happen again when it’s safe to do so.,I swear. I dread reading every post Texas A&M makes. Just seems like terrible decision after terrible decision. Let the student be honored. Virtual Silver Taps is not the same. You cannot create that moment for the family on your computer.,This is absolutely ridiculous. #notanotherdime,Class of 1994. I would like to think that I was one of the last fortunate classes to be influenced and mentored by professors and administrations that were part of the making or very close to those original framers of our beloved school. I had the privilege of hearing direct stories and traditions for many years. Having said that hearing things like this make my stomach turn in that our school is changing and adapting itself to national movements that would allow the kind of leadership and student culture that would allow these kinds of decisions. I have spent many years inspiring my daughters to follow in my families engineering footsteps and become proud Aggies. But you know when your own daughters due to these types of decisions have no desire to attend A&M things are really bad. I am not talking about just any changes but these are sacred traditions that at one time regardless of pandemic::: wars::: aliens arriving would have been upheld. Having said that I also have to ask myself what are we and others doing to not allow our beloved traditions to get washed away by what ever new stream arrives. Unfortunately not enough of us are doing anything about it.,If we can host football and have in person sorority bid day::: we should have Silver Taps in person too.,This is so wrong. No it needs to be in person.,Hosting Vandy on Sept 26th::: but no Silver Taps?,Dang. Of all decisions::: this one I’m not too sure about.,Does that mean they can protest Sully virtually also.?.?.,I bet the students gather in person. The university president isn’t the keeper of Aggie traditions. Students are.,The most beautiful and moving ceremony I have ever seen -\-\ seeing the platoon soundlessly entering the space::: and all their carefully rehursed gestures of respect -\-\ is sublimly spiritual and presents a most fitting closure.,Do outside social distance::: my goodness. Been having protest over Sully outside so continue Taps a tradition the right way not virtual!!!!,Petition in the works from BMA to remove Young. His time has run out.,Horse laugh... 😡,https:// www.peta.org/ blog/ texas-am-faceboo k-censorship-la wsuit-victory/ ?utm_source=PETA %3A%3AFacebook& utm_medium=Soci al&utm_campaign =0820%3A%3Aviv% 3A%3APETA%3A%3A Facebook%3A%3AS uing+TAMU+Again %3A%3A%3A%3Alin k,Discretion is the better part of valor. Finding a way to maintain the substance of Muster and Silver Taps while minimizing risks is the right call. Thirty years of military service tells me to conduct a risk assessment::: select a course of action::: and move out smartly. This is not a matter of the same consequence and global impact as storming the beaches of Normandy to topple the Third Reich where this is no alternative for to depriving the adversary of his territorial gains and forcing unconditional surrender. On a pragmatic note::: the “Yes::: your Honor::: I authorized X to happen” conversation is really worth trying to avoid. BTHO COVID-19!,Silver Taps was started in 1898 to honor the amazing and legendary Lawrence Sullivan Ross one of the best presidents in A&M history. A historic individual whose leadership still guides us today!,How easy would it be to socially distance outside in masks? Silver Taps is an incredibly valuable tradition. As someone who stood for someone they loved dearly at Taps and attended nearly all Taps as a student::: I can’t imagine that experience being made virtual. Poor decision A&M.,This::: like many of the decisions TAMU has made recently::: is wrong. We are not the lesser school in Austin::: stop trying to make us like them.,Easy to be the King/queen of criticism. However Aggieland needs our unwavering unified support during these difficult times. Squeeze hard and hump it in recognizing today’s strength will be appreciated in the decades to come.,Bet you won’t see protests on campus to allow Silver Taps...,A solemn and sacred Aggie tradition.,"From the article: “It is likely that our students have experienced the loss of loved ones — family members::: friends at home — or know others who have experienced this type of loss since March when we were all last together in Aggieland:::” Reber said. “During that time::: our students may not have been able to honor those loved ones as they would have liked.""  So we'll continue to make it so loved ones can not be honored as they would have liked.  Silver Taps is not some magical music that grants comfort. Silver Taps is the gathering. Silver Taps is the stark silence broken only by footsteps::: the clear call of the bugles::: and the sharp crack of the rifles. Silver Taps is a long silent walk across campus::: feeling the presence without words of the friends walking with you::: and the absence of the one no longer there.  Honestly::: it would be better to hold off until the Spring than it would be to put forth this tone-deaf attempt at tradition.  I for one hope a large crowd of students shows up in Academic Plaza that night anyway.",Wait::: are you having classes on campus?,Protest at Sully = Good. Honor fallen students at Sully = Bad.  It's time for leadership of our University to be returned to Aggies who care about preserving what's great about A&M::: and growing future generations who will be a benefit to Texas::: themselves::: their families::: and this country.  Fire Young. Probably Sharp::: too. Anyone in leadership who hasn't acted yet is complicit.,Texas A&M University and The Association of Former Students - What’s it feel like to lose literally all your remaining donors?  Asking for a friend. Since you aren’t hosting the first virtual Silver Taps. What’s actually going on is that you’re not hosting Silver Taps for the first time in over 120 years. When 8 students have lost their lives no less.  You should be ashamed of yourselves.,Not the same. Pitiful and disappointing.,I remember when A&M would buck ridiculous::: bs stuff like this. What are you afraid of? You gonna shut down for flu season? Hay fever?,"Living in dorms perfectly fine::: attending football games not a problem::: but a ""no"" to Silver Taps?🙄",Horrifying to me that you allow a person who espouses violence to teach your students.

My eldest son studied there in 2014 until 2016.,Dear Texas A&M officials who keep putting out these feel-good videos:  Please tell the communists and socialists in Aggieland::: especially those led by the Marxist Anthropology Department professors who need to be fired::: to stop spreading hate with their chalk messages all over the sidewalks and Texas A&M seals on our beloved campus. Your hate pollution stinks!  Also::: please create a video that explains how “Black Lives Matter” is a socialist/ communist/ Marxist-led organization while “Black lives matter” is a commentary and belief that African Americans are loved and valued in our society. There is a difference between these two phrases and you have a duty to educate our society on the difference.  Have a great Fall 2020 Semester.

Way to go!,Stop it already !!! You are being controlled !,Students are being told that they are not allowed to post social media photos of themselves without masks on.

Wearing a mask has proven scientifically from multiple peer reviewed sources to help decrease the chances of spreading diseases to others around you. Wearing a mask is for the safety of those around you. Even if there’s only a slight chance that you could help prevent the spread by doing what is at absolute worst a minor inconvenience of wearing a mask why wouldn’t you?

All students::: faculty::: and staff can get tested for COVID-19 for free with Texas A&M Student Health Services! The mouth swab tests normally take less than five minutes and you'll receive your results from Curative Inc. in 36-48 hours.  Learn more: tx.ag/TestFAQs Register for a free test: tx.ag/covidtest,2020-08-13 15:09:00,Kayla Wilford,Everyday?,It is great,It’s great that y’all are providing free testing. But CDC recommendations are a nasal swab::: which is the only test the hospitals are using. So why the oral swab? CDC says an oral swab can be done. But how many students are going to do this test correctly to themselves? Your medical personal also should be wearing a face shield while assisting with these tests. Otherwise they are exposing themselves even with a face mask. https:// www.cdc.gov/ coronavirus/ 2019-ncov/lab/ guidelines-clini cal-specimens.h tml,Marissa Voigt,Covid-19 testing at the quack shack?!?! Now that’s funny!!!,"My son said the areas outside the dorms are packed with students playing basketball::: etc. He heard about fraternities and sororities rushing at outdoor spaces::: but that nobody was wearing masks and students were much less than 6 feet apart. He predicts college will last one month. Why isn't there a ""campus police"" of sorts walking around to monitor these situations?? I trusted my child to you.",Why would you get tested? You could conceivably catch it on the way out.,Molly Murphy,"While this is awesome in throry... I certainly hope that the logistics of actually providing this service will be better than this place back in the early '90's.

Disgraceful! So glad my daughter’s time is almost up with this school! Not worried about anything but the almighty dollar! Kids have to take their finals after Thanksgiving at home because y’all don’t want them to come back and possibly spread the virus but yet will be having and welcoming out of town and out of state visitors to the city and school for football. That’s a bunch of BS! I hate that I paid to have my child attend this school. Your “Aggie Spirit” sucks!,Payton Gray 👍🏻,Johnny Hammonds,Gabbi Okun show mom,Chaney Bell Vincent,Give these Aggies a chance to walk the stage in December - they earned it!!!,Only Aggie in our family graduated from TAMU in May 2020 and no graduation ceremony.

YOUR LOVING GRAND PARENTS💞::: Nellieree and Bill NANTZ (also known as Memaw😍 and Papu😎) 🙏🤗🌟🎓❤️👩🏻‍🎓👍🎓💐,Yes... Find a way to let all the 2020 graduates walk - May-Aug-Dec... If you can make plans for football games with fans- you can plan a graduation for all of these graduates who worked long and hard for their degrees!!,Congrats 2020!! When will May 2020 graduates get their walk. They were told August and have heard nothing. Don’t get me wrong::: I love football but walking for graduation is much more important. These kids have put a lot of time in and deserve it. Come on A&M!!!! Make it happen!!,Gary Crawford Doug Crawford Janice 'Taylor' Crawford Steven Crawford Clarissa Krings Keenan,Hope Scales Karlie Beth Stehle,Whoop! I'll be watching!,Gig 'em Aggies!

The conferral video AND the Kyle Field scoreboard?,When will Fall graduates walk across the stage (I hope),The link shows the conferral video from May....will there be any other info shared and new videos or are you just recycling from May Virtual Graduation? Also::: it does not say start time for the grad name readings.,Very very hard ! They should wear masks and faculty and walk .,Amen!!,How in the world can we have 50:::000 people coming to a football game (which I think is great) and still not have a ceremony for 10:::000 students from May graduation. It is clear from this administration that the revenue generating activities can still press forward::: but the events that really bind us as Aggies (graduation::: Fish Camp::: etc.) are not as important to them. We need a change in administration to ensure we really embrace our core values of Loyalty::: Leadership::: Integrity::: Excellence::: Respect and Selfless Service. The Loyalty and Respect aspect really isn’t being shown to our recent former students.,Congratulations !! Gig’em,Ditto what Joan Parker said... congrats 🎈 🎈 🎈.

Do you ever smell a familiar scent before it starts to rain? That smell is called 'petrichor'!

You need to check out the Aggie BSM (Baptist Student Ministry). This is a place special to my heart. It absolutely helped shape me into the follower of Christ that I am! Where it says in Romans 12:1-2 that Christ will transform us by the renewing of our minds::: that’s what God uses the BSM for every day! There are OVER 100 wonderful groups and clubs for followers of Christ at Texas A&M::: and the Aggie BSM is definitely a powerful::: Bible-based::: God-centered one of them! You will make family and friends with people from all over the world::: find respite from your busy day in their 1-hour free lunch Wednesday devotional sponsored by local churches::: grow in Thursday night Small group Bible studies::: be discipled at their Friday lunches for $2 (1 hour precisely)::: be challenged to serve in their many ministries; this is also where I met many of my different Christian roommates while at Aggieland. My heart for the nations took shape through serving in their international student ministry. I worshipped Sunday morning at a local church::: but my faith and ministry blossomed through the Aggie Baptist Student Ministry under a wonderful staff! It is located within walking distance::: one block north of campus::: behind Northgate. Please consider checking it out. You won’t be sorry you did! You’re missing out if you don’t!,Tracey White,We just say we smell rain.,My hubby learned a new word while on vacay::: when I used 'petrichor'.

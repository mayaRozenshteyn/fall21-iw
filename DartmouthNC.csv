To have a safe community (and that includes faculty and many many others) some standard must be set.,Not a controversial announcement. Once we have an FDA approved vaccine(s) we‚Äôll see a lot of vaccine mandates. Vaccination isn‚Äôt mandated for anyone at this point because none are FDA approved. They only have emergency use authorization. Pfizer and Moderna just became eligible to seek FDA approval. I expect they‚Äôll both get it before the fall semester. Hence not a controversial anticipatory announcement.,The Review (Is it still around?) would have a field day with this infringing on their freedom and rights. I agree with Fauci (I am also an MD::: though not of Fauci's caliber) that public health is the key issue::: not ideology. As a nonpublic university::: I think DC is correct in this action.

Beyond disappointing not to mention a bit mind boggling. Hoping our students learned better problem solving skills in their 4 years at the school than the college seems capable of.,So disappointed that the 20s were overlooked this year when they were promised a graduation this year as their‚Äôs was virtual last year.,"SO this is at least something but I cannot believe that the College - with all of its intellectual capacity - cannot figure a way to be more inclusive. With vaccines available to the age group of most of us (parents and faculty/
staff)::: with our students being isolated::: tested regularly::: and held in the ""bubble"" for the term::: with the availability of outdoor venues such as this one that is well beyond the capacity needed to be socially distanced and safe - Dartmouth is the perfect place for this::: or so one would think. I cannot understand how the proven ability to perform vast numbers of daily COVID tests and the rate of vaccination in adults right now has not prompted them to change course but I have sent numerous emails asking them to reconsider once again. I read somewhere that this stadium holds 11000 people. We still have 2 months to plan. Giving each student 2 tickets to attend graduation is a gesture that will go a very long way. And yes - the 20's should absolutely get their moment!",Seriously::: What about the 20‚Äôs that were promised something this year!! You‚Äôre so excited to celebrate this year what about the 20‚Äôs??????,This is beyond sad! And at this point ridiculous. Doesn‚Äôt say much for these elite institutions!,1 Dartmouth 21 student. 2 parents. All vaccinated. Why can‚Äôt we come to graduation? Please update the plan.,"Wow::: it's almost like they are trying to limit mass gatherings during a global pandemic::: especially when new variants are proving to be more deadly to younger people.

"After much careful consideration::: we have decided to move forward with our plan to return approximately half of our undergraduate student body to Dartmouth::: beginning Sept. 8.

We are committed to making on-campus learning happen for as many of our students as possible. We believe our reopening plan::: announced earlier this summer::: allows us to do this. It also allows us to provide students with more resources to complete their work::: which some may not have at home.

To our students::: you are vital members of our beloved Dartmouth community. Along with faculty::: staff and alumni::: we believe in you and have great confidence in your ability to meet this moment. We look forward to partnering with you to carry out our plan. And::: most importantly::: we look forward to welcoming you to campus.

Our goal is to manage our plan effectively and safely while respecting and sustaining the hard work the Upper Valley has done to flatten the curve. Our plan provides for:

- Pre-arrival testing for domestic undergraduate students approved to live off and on campus
- Testing on arrival and on days three and seven for all students
- 14 days of quarantine following arrival
- Wastewater monitoring of residential buildings
- Regular surveillance testing throughout the term
- A required daily temperature and symptom self-assessment screening for all students::: faculty::: and staff entering campus buildings
- Restrictions on the size of groups that may meet
- A hygiene campaign
- A mandatory face-covering policy
- Clear community expectations that all enrolling students are expected to sign as a condition for access to campus. (Read the expectations here: https://bit.ly/34BqMYo)

Dartmouth Announces Changes to Varsity Athletics Program",2020-07-09 17:53:22,"President Hanlon and athletics director Sheehy really botched this decision and its communications.
We all should expect better leadership. Show it now and reverse these poor actions.","President Hanlon and athletics director Sheehy really botched this decision and its communications.
We all should expect better leadership. Show it now and reverse these poor actions.","This is an absolute disgrace::: but I suppose not surprising from this administration.
We've already been through this once with the swimming and diving teams. The previous administration saw the error of their ways and reinstated the teams. Hopefully the new current administration realizes what a horrible decision this is before it's too late.",Aside from this blow to athletics::: Dartmouth's plan for a return to school precludes any athlete with a lease commitment off campus from participating in any of their team's training or competitions. In fact::: no Dartmouth student off campus has access to ANY facilities::: including libraries::: dining::: etc.,Btw::: as of this post::: over 26000 individuals have signed the petition to reinstate DCSD::: what does that say that those that signed the petition are more invested than the athletic director,Apparently::: a Hanlon doesn‚Äôt know his student body and certainly not the swim and dive student athletes!?! Class of 24 admission profile stats - swim and dive admission scores SAT 1502 entire class 1501; swim and dive ACT 33.40 entire class 33. They earned their admission spots with academics and athletics skills are extra. Their admission stats are higher than the rest of the class...his rationale is not supported by data and facts...why did he choose swim and dive to cut??,The AD Sheehy's published remarks should make all student athletes take heed. If you are considering Dartmouth over other institutions::: know that your program can be eliminated without regard to your commitment to the school over other great institutions that may have recruited you. Also::: if you are an alum athlete::: why should you invest in a program whose leader describes any program as second class::: remember this during fundraising times when Sheehy will be appealing to your wallets. As for the disparaging remarks on division III athletics::: many of those athletes have competed on the professional level::: including the center for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. So your elitist::: arrogant comments demonstrate a true ignorance that should not be representative of an Ivy League program of inclusiveness.,Sheehy must go! Click the link and look at some of the derogatory and slanderous comments made by Harry Sheehy::: Athletic Director at Dartmouth College to the College‚Äôs newspaper. Cutting the swim and dive teams was enough for this guy now he has to publicly issue defamatory statements insulting the student athletes to their peer group and putting down all Division III athletics while he is at it. Surprising since he was a Division III basketball coach for 17 years before assuming the AD role at Dartmouth. I guess he is out of his league. He needs to be held accountable for his actions and statements. I believe the Dartmouth community will come together and hold him accountable and the College administrators need to step up and support these students. This type is bullying should be allowed to perpetuate at an institution of higher learning like Dartmouth College. Administrators do the right thing and remove Sheehy and reinstate the swim and dive team!,"Thanks All. Also please sign the petition for Rowing. This team has very few recruits::: extremely high GPA and represents all that is Dartmouth. No one deserves this once they bleed green. Lots of challenges for sure but the use of the endowment in the in the midst of a pandemic seems the best time ever to spend the money for kids now and the future

If cuts are necessary::: postpone them until your current athletes complete their time so at least you::: Dartmouth::: can demonstrate respect to these athletes who chose you!

For some perspective::: the endowment was ~$2.0 billion when they cut swimming in 2002.,Several elite universities::: including Stanford and Brown::: are making similar adjustments in their priorities. Personally::: I think reducing the number of recruited athletes is a good thing.,How will the Hanover Country Club deficit be solved by the elimination of Swimming and Diving? Swimming and Diving has nothing to do with the Hanover Country Club - it's operated out of the fitness center!,My favorite young alumni appreciated club sports at Dartmouth: water polo and bicycling::: on shoestring budgets. The Outing Club has been the heart and soul of my own Dartmouth experience.,"How about just thinning down the administration?

I didn‚Äôt know about the golf course financial black hole. Too bad.,Philip Hanlon::: President and Harry Sheehy::: AD - PATHETIC!

Some changes included in the plan for the coming academic year:

‚û°Ô∏è Students will have the opportunity to be on campus for two terms::: with each class having one term in which they will have priority. Students will then rank their preferences for a second on-campus term.

‚û°Ô∏è The fall term will begin on Sept. 14.

‚û°Ô∏è Students coming to campus will be required to quarantine for 14 days after arrival.

‚û°Ô∏è There will be mandatory virus testing for all students upon their return to campus::: with regular testing continuing throughout the term. Students who don't wish to participate in testing and other required health protocols can choose to enroll in remote learning off-campus.

‚û°Ô∏è All undergraduates will have single rooms or live in two-room doubles::: which will reduce the overall space available in residence halls but maintain proper physical distancing requirements.

‚û°Ô∏è All undergraduates on campus will leave as soon as fall classes are over and take final exams remotely the week after Thanksgiving.

‚û°Ô∏è Major changes are not expected in graduate and professional student housing as existing on-campus housing already provides single bedrooms. Many graduate and professional students live off campus.

‚û°Ô∏è Most undergraduate classes and faculty office hours will be held remotely.

‚û°Ô∏è All community members living and working on campus will be required to participate in daily health screening using a phone application or communicating on a website.

‚û°Ô∏è Dartmouth Library will be open only to faculty::: students::: and staff.

‚û°Ô∏è Enhanced cleaning procedures will be used in all campus buildings::: some workspaces will be reconfigured::: and work schedules may be changed to safeguard the health of employees.

Dartmouth Announces Plans for the Coming Academic Year | Dartmouth News",2020-06-29 18:07:51,"Hi!
Just wondering if anyone knows whether there will be windows in all students' rooms while quarantining?
I read Dean Lively's update to Freshman about the 14 day quarantine. Considering that these students may have to stay in their room the entire period without fresh air or any exercise out of their rooms::: that seems really important to me. They have done studies and even 10 minutes of outdoor air makes a huge impact on mental health. I think being inside a windowless room for 14 days without being let out for fresh air would so detrimental to the students health in so many ways.
I asked the question in several formats but did not see the answer to it. If anyone else did could you please share it?
Thanks so much!
Sheryl","When I read the campus restrictions being placed on new and returning students it looks as if Dartmouth would prefer students NOT return to campus.

I wish Dartmouth had asked the alumni if they had second homes located in off season locations they would consider renting to students forming small Quaran-Teams. As long as classes are online I see no reason why students couldn‚Äôt form groups of 4 or 5::: rent houses::: take classes online and enjoy some semblance of a normal life.

I am sure there are many Dartmouth alumni with second homes that would reach out and help this generation in these troubled times. Dartmouth could have extended the ‚Äústudent conduct code‚Äù to include any houses rented. It would have built a much stronger Dartmouth community. There are no solutions but there are better options. We are watching the market adapt in real time.",What is the logic of the 14 day quarantine if the student tests negative?,Feels more thoughtful than some other colleges that are letting all undergrads come back but not providing dorm accommodations.,Dartmouth hasn‚Äôt thought through this well. 23s haven‚Äôt experienced a spring term. Let them come back for consecutive quarters and let 24s have consecutive fall and winter quarters. Why do they need Spring???? 23s haven‚Äôt gotten a spring term. All the moving in and moving out is another HUGE headache they haven‚Äôt considered,Now::: with all these safety precautions::: will they have football?,Time for a gap year imo,Masks?,What about international students who are on university scholarships :::where will they live since after the fall everyone is supposed to leave campus?,I am actually really concerned about this plan and its affects on students' mental health. Returning to campus::: testing::: mandatory forced quarantine in students single room for 14 days::: testing again. Food delivered to room. Not being allowed to leave room to exercise or anything. After all of this::: still have the majority of classes remote and no social programming allowed. Contact testing every day. If you break any of the rules and have any social contact with others within 24 hours you must leave. It sounds like a recipe for a mental health disaster for a new Freshman much less any student. What's the point of returning to campus? But if you choose to do virtual::: you must pay full tuition with room and board as well for the whole year? And if you decide to defer a year you must decline acceptance and begin the admissions process all over again from the beginning and you are not guaranteed a spot for next year. Just curious::: Is this what other colleges are doing as well?,"What is the rationale for having students on campus if most undergraduate courses and faculty office hours will happen remotely? Presumably most conventional aspects of life beyond the classroom will also be curtailed.

This appears to be a no-win arrangement.","Paying full tuition including room and board for ""primarily remote learning"" as indicated on the letter to students::: even while studying remotely.",Can you please let us know what this means for graduate students?,That‚Äôs great news üôèüèΩ,"So wonderful!

In the weathervane the cultural differences in their seating would be historically accurate for the era and common sensical.",This is your history. The art can be both appreciated and critiqued. It is disappointing you choose to deny students from observing history and engaging in critical thinking to ensue discussion.,Could this weathervane be re worked to be less offensive? Like is the rum barrel the offensive part...,Long overdue!,So once again the few dictate what is to be done instead of what has been there forever and never bothered anyone. This is one sick world,Well done,Absolutely preposterous!,I don't normally engage with content like this::: but boy are there a lot of triggered older people in this comment section. Consider this a note to my future self to continue to be open to the possibility that beliefs I held 10::: 20::: 30::: or 40 years ago may need to evolve along with humanity::: and that fact is not a personal attack on my self-worth.,Are you Serious,"Finally! This ""history"" is a pretty false portrayal anyway and belongs in a museum if anywhere","Hey::: fun fact for everyone: Wheelock pulled a fast one on Samson Occom when he ""founded Dartmouth"" (that is::: he sent his Native American protegee to raise substantial money from benefactors in England for a ""Christian Indian school"" in Connecticut::: only to renege and create a school for predominantly white colonists while Occom was overseas.) He moved the school to Hanover for the purity of nature and potentially some recruitment advantage. He left Occom's wife and family::: who he was trusted to care for in Occom's absence::: destitute. For nearly 200 years Dartmouth only educated about 60 Native American students -\-\ a very different vision than the one Wheelock envisioned when he was collaborating with Occum & building their initial school::: the precursor to Dartmouth.

So when we consider the weather vane::: from 1928::: what foundational story are we telling? Because what we see here is ultimately an ahistorical caricature that never happened.",The Ayes HAVE IT!üòè,Maybe a unicorn would be a better choice to replace it with.,üëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèü§ù,Thank you!,"The issue with the weather vane is the position of Wheelock in relation to the Native American. The position is one of superiority. Wheelock is looking down on the Native American. Also::: it displays that the Native American is addressing his ‚Äúwhite saviour‚Äù. For those claiming that they are ‚Äúsharing a peace pipe in an equal and peaceful ceremony.‚Äù You have no idea how a pipe ceremony works and the protocols. When I attended Dartmouth::: I visited the Hood Museum. They have large historical paintings of Wheelock. In the majority of the paintings I observed::: Wheelock is always in a position of superiority and power. He is always looking down on the Indians::: as if they were his subjects. The paintings referenced alcohol too... as an evil gift to the the Native Americans::: who naively accepted. Everyone who claims that it is ‚Äúsimply‚Äù a peaceful gesture::: and that ‚Äúis all that it is‚Äù... I welcome you to my Indigenous lands::: and to my reserve to witness a pipe ceremony. You will be humbled quickly::: and your ignorance will dissipate with the smoke of the pipe. Every person in the circle of the pipe ceremony::: is equal. It is an honour::: to be in attendance. The respect and common thought of equality::: is exemplified by sitting at the same level on the ground. Only then can equality be achieved. If you bring a chair to sit on and look down::: I guarantee the Elder will not accept you into the circle to partake in ceremony. However::: if you come open minded::: and with respect::: you will definitely be part of it. Here is explanation::: that was in an earlier thread from an Art History Scholar at Dartmouth. I hope she doesn‚Äôt mind me sharing::: as it is perfectly expressed :

‚ÄúFirst::: this object is symbolic not a representation of facts. As a symbolic object it is riddled with hierarchies that are intended to present Wheelock as a civilized benefactor and educator and an anonymous and deliberately ""primitivized"" indigenous man as his acolyte. Devin Buffalo is correct that this is clearly indicated in their relative positioning and unequal height. It is also indicated in the inaccurate modes of dress that::: again::: are not about what things were really like at the founding of the college but rather about 19th and 20th century conceptions of the ""noble savage."" The presence of the rum keg is yet another inaccuracy. All symbolic art is ""inaccurate"" insofar as it does not seek to represent reality but rather to convey a message. The message here is clear::: and it is anachronistic to imagine that in the early 20th century::: at the height of ""playing Indian"" on campus::: the intention was to be ""inclusive"" and symbolize the beginning of ""peace""... ‚Äú","Speaking of Native Americans::: i.e::: American Indians::: may I make a suggestion to Dartmouth College President Philip Hanlon? Maria Tallchief::: an Osage::: America's first true prima ballerina. I had first learned of Maria Tallchief in an article in the Illustrated World Encyclopedia::: which my aunt owns::: a couple of years back. Maria Tallchief revolutionized ballet and put American ballet on the map.

A ballerina weather vane atop a historic building in an Ivy League campus is::: I'm sure::: a first. It would bear Maria Tallchief's likeness.","Sad! Shameful to rewrite history at the whims of ever-changing cultural demands. Some will not be satisfied until Dartmouth is shut down forever ‚Äî we can never be ‚Äúwoke‚Äù enough. üíî

What should be going on? Tell a full history::: emphasize education. Let the vane remain::: place a placard in the foyer with a comprehensive history of the imagery::: telling both the bad and the good. Be proud of the ‚Äúwhole history‚Äù and the narrative through which you relay history today.

Update the placard based on all we have learned through our rich existence as one of the most historic institutions in the continent. Otherwise... why even bother.",Good. D educated few Native Americans until the late 1960s. The iconography is offensive and stereotypical -AGR D75,Very supportive of this. Thank you for (finally) doing this::: Dartmouth. These things belong in museums not active usage.,I always put Dartmouth at a different level of education. However with last decision I would never send my children or grandchildren to Dartmouth. It has now become a part of the socialist parties indoctrination machine. Very sad that it has fallen so far. This vane signifies peace and brotherhood not subordination of one culture to another. They are smoking a peace pipe as equals.,"Great article::: particularly towards the end. ""More than 1:::200 Native Americans and Alaskan Natives::: representing over 200 tribes::: have attended Dartmouth::: which has the highest number of Native American students::: and has graduated more Native Americans::: than any of its Ivy League peers.""",Glad to hear it!,This is so pathetic. My ancestors were Indians and it doesn‚Äôt offend me. Really? It offends BLM and they don‚Äôt have any Indian heritage. It offends me that it is coming down. It‚Äôs part of history whether people like it or not. It should stay there.,What is so bad about smoking the peace pipe together?? Let‚Äôs stop trying to erase history.,Keep caving. When will it end. Beware::: the slope is slippery.,Thank you President Hanlon. The removal is long overdue.,Removing a weather vane because of which way the wind blows.....,Thank You.,Over 200 years of history and tradition flushed down the toilet for a passing intellectual fad. Sad. So very sad.,I am offended!! The weathervane displays exactly what the College was created for. How can you deny our foundation and expect to remain who we are?,Wonderful! ‚Äò74,Good to see!,Ugh,Thank you - I‚Äôd love to see the crest change as well. Rachel (Ringel) Lukoff::: D04 T11,Good move. D'04 and Tuck '11,So it only takes black people dying for my alma mater to become responsive to the needs of students of color.,While you‚Äôre at it::: can you come up with a real coat of arms for Dartmouth like all the other Ivies have (not a knock off of Stanford‚Äôs letter with a tree) and a real mascot ... maybe this is the time to rethink all of that in a way that is inclusive. And also tear down Judge and stop charging full room rates for a space the size of a small closet in there.,Darby and Bazille,"Posting a link from the Daily D a few years back. I don‚Äôt agree with removing the weather vane. Of course we all have a right to our own opinions.

‚ÄúIn 2012::: 172 Native American students were enrolled across the institution::: and there are slightly more than 900 Native American alumni of Dartmouth College. This is more than the combined number of Native American alumni from the seven other Ivy League institutions.‚Äù
That‚Äôs a powerful statement.

Keep in mind @dartmouth has done a lot since I was there 40 years ago. We admit more indigenous Americans than the other Ivies and we have a stellar Native Americans Studies department. Apologetically we also graduated @DineshDSouza and @IngrahamAngle.,I'm happy to have kept the one of these Dad had on the shed at his home. I come down on not changing history and monuments::: but telling more of both sides of the story.,Maybe they should be reading 1984 - Orwell - erasing history. History is there to learn from. It is not there for you to erase.,Dartmouth has been around for over 250 years and it finds this offensive NOW?,Our universities are run by out of touch left wing loons....

Dear Mr. Samuel Yin::: Tang Prize::: Dr::: Bill Gates::: Gates Foundation::: Mr. Terry Kuo::: Mr. Tsuei Yusheng and Lin Chi Lung of Home Crist and all Journlaists :
We need to kick Albert Yang out of UC Babara::: all these four students::: Chetana Ramaiyer::: Mallika Singh::: Om Khandekar and Ruth Feng need to be kick out from their colleges. They can not lie to polices of Santa Clara County Sheriff Office.
They can not fraud their classmates and schoolmates. They conspired together to lie in School Magazine El ESTOQUE of Monta Vista High. They targeted Samsung VP's wife Charlene Lee to do very ugly thing to let me be jailed from Dec 28::: 2017 to Dec 26::: 2018. I have enough of these students of Monta Vista High School. They need to be kicked out from their colleges.
Nobody can use Public High School Magazine to lie to jail me one year. I graduated from Yale University. I work hard. Even my second son's birthday. I still work at that day. I was arrested on my second son's 17 year old birthday at the front curbside of Monta Vista High School for ten minutes only. I did not show Albert Yang's name. But judge of Palo Alto Criminal Court extorted me for 100:::000 bail on Dec 28::: 2017. I am sure I did not commit any crime. I will talk their principal of colleges to seek justice. They need to compensate for my one year jail time. I have never threaten Albert Yang and have never stalked anyone. If I have::: let everybody see the four compact disks of two police reports. There is no reason to jail a Samsung VP's wife for one year. My husband was a Senior Director of Intel. He was a Senior Director of Mediateck too. I work for a non profit organation. I donate all my money to do good thing for Asian Americans. I don't know why these five students can use school magazine to post two articles to accuse me to put death threaten to Albert Yang. I have never stalk anyone and never threaten anyone. I need to see these four compact disks right now. Police has responsiblities
to translate any emails I wrote to all jounalists and Christians of River of Life Christian Church and Home of Christ.
It's time to give me justice. I will talk to all principals of these five students. I have never met OM Khandekar. I met Ruth Feng and one American born Indian. But the article at El ESTOQUE on Oct 10::: 2017 have four students. Ruth Feng and a American born Indian lied. I told these two Asian that assault happened on Nov 8::: 2015 at Taiwan Culture Center in Milpitas. But these four students lied assault happened at River of Life Christian Church. They lied someone took two posters on Oct 9::: 2017.
But I did not lose any poster on Oct 9::: 2017. So these four students lied somone took two posters from me. They lied. Then they lied I stood at the student parking lot. But I have never stood at the Student Parking Lot of Monta Vista High School. according to the photo taken by Mallika Singh. Behind me was student parking lot but I stood at a curb of Monta Vista High School. Then they lied Assistant Principal Andrew Goldenkranz had a Financial Specialist Calvin Wong talked to me. But I have never met Calvin Wong. Assistant Principal Andrew Goldenkranz admitted he lied in his facebook. Now Andrew Goldenkranz was a teacher of Cupertino High. But he hided at his facebook and did not show he was an Assistant Principal of Monta Vista High and now a teacher of Cupertino High School. This teacher will keep harming students of Cupertino High School.
Albert Yang's mom lied I put death threaten to her son. Then Albert Yang should talk to the Principal of UC Santa Babara when did I put death threaten to him. He needs to show evidences to all falculities of Santa Barbara and say sorry to me.
Her mom Lana Shew stated I tresspassed Jason Jenkun Yang's House then show me the evidence. Jason Jenkung Yang worked at Broadcome and live in Saratoga. He is a such rich person then how can I intrude his house? Did Lana Shew mean his door had a hole or his gate did not close? Lana Shew stated I forced Jason Jenkun Yang to say something in favor to me. But Jason Jenkun Yang did lie to Milpitas Sargent Abbie Serrano. I sent many emails to Albert Yang and all cell members of our group that Jason Jenkun Yang sat left to me 20 to 30 feet left to me but he lied to police she sat 5 to 6 rows behind me and 20 to 30 fe",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The classroom experience::: the on-campus experience::: the opportunity for classroom discussion::: working with classmates::: living with classmates: all of these are what make Dartmouth worth more than less selective schools. It is the selection of students::: the hallmark of super-selective
schools like Dartmouth::: that creates a value. The chance to collaborate and learn with like-minded scholars is the distinction that permits parents like myself to hand an additional $200:::000 to Dartmouth. Every bit of that distinction is gone with online classes. My child ""graduates"" this year::: so the question is moot for me; however::: it is quite important to the parents of another 4:::000 Dartmouth students.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I wore my bathing suit under my gown. I had fixed my hair and face nicely::: but I straight up did not care at all what I looked like underneath (that’s what the party is for afterwards). When I jumped in the SM River::: so close to its headwaters::: I felt baptized::: like a spiritual cleansing took place. Whether you’re a woman or a dude::: or young or old::: I highly recommend jumping in the river.
Texas State was a huge blessing for me::: and the geography department was an even greater one. ❤️

"Texas State's Dr. William Chittenden recently investigated a topic that could potentially affect millions of Americans — the canceling of student debt. With policymakers putting forth forgiveness proposals and President Biden ""prepared to write off a $10:::000 debt:::"" what does this mean for the nation's economy::: and who would benefit most? Dr. Chittenden answers these questions and more.

THECONVERSATION.COM
Canceling student loan debt will barely boost the economy::: but a targeted approach could help certain groups",7/11/2021 15:00,Or we could all remember that this debt wasn’t forced on these people and they could be adults and pay it back like the rest of us did. Y’all act like this is the governments fault for these people asking for a loan. Give me a break.,"Biden said ""nothing will fundamentally change."" It's the only promise he will keep. There will be no student debt cancellation::: no $15 minimum wage and no Public Option::: even though he campaigned on all of these things. Lip service doesn't mean much when you don't deliver on promises. Let's also not forget that Biden was the one who directly contributed to creating the student debt problem. I will believe it when I see it.",$400 a month? He makes it sound like that’s supposed to be small. That’s the same number that half of all Americans can’t handle if it were an unexpected cost. Imagine giving that money back to those people!,"The biggest thing we should learn from this is that college is in fact too expensive.

There should also be protections for borrowers just with any other loan and part of the fight is to obtain bankruptcy as an option for borrowers who’s lives are literally ruined because of student loans.

There should also be protections on interest rates because some people end up in a loop where they barely pay anything over interest and their loans stay stagnant meaning they will NEVER pay off their loans regardless of their payments.

I would love for student loans to be forgiven. But it’s really only acceptable if we can stop viewing college students and grads as people who “chose” to be indebted.

Many of you complain that high school doesn’t teach you about economics or credit cards or finances.

Maybe that’s why we can understand that 17-18 year olds going to college are victims here because they were unaware of the repercussions of what they agreed to pay back.

If you can’t see that MANY students were taken advantage of here then that’s why you’re struggling to see why this is important.

I don’t care if student loans get forgiven. I’ll keep paying regardless::: but even I can recognize that many kids are taken advantage of by the student loan system and people are profiting off of their lack of knowledge.

Even more so::: you’re speaking of a generation who saw mostly no other option.

The enemy isn’t borrowers or students. It’s predatory student loans and overly expensive tuition.

Don’t forgive student loans::: but protect the borrowers like you would with any other loan. Especially when these borrowers were completely unaware of how the student loan system works and were provided little to no information about how they work until after borrowing.",Yet the universities keep jacking up the cost to attend,Only if the Colleges and Universities pay the debt with their inflated endowments,But anyone who responsibly saved in a 529 College Savings Plan has to pay the government big penalties for anything not used for college after paying for their child’s education.🤯,We need to talk about these parking tickets then,"As a university that hired ""Beto"" O'Rourke::: it isn't very hard to predict where the university stands on this issue.",I don’t want my tax dollars paying your debt!! Take responsibility for your actions! No one forced you to go to college and take on debt!,How unfair for those of us that worked hard to budget and pay for school vs taking student loans. Decrease cost for all instead.,Tuition is so expensive because colleges are government subsidized through government insured loans. When the schools figured out they could charge any amount per credit hour (plus fees) and the USGOV would guarantee the loans::: it created this mess.,This is a slap in the face to people like me who took an rotc scholarship or signed a military service agreement to pay for school,Why don't we just make the cost of education a little more affordable?,What about those of us who paid off our student loans for both ourselves and our children? Shouldn’t we be reimbursed? You want to talk about unfairness! This idea takes the cake!!,Aaron Sepaugh,Texas State wants this so they can buy the rest of San Marcos,First::: cut the pay of admin and professors.

I was searching for a hotel room for her and she said::: ""Mom::: the hotels can lose electricity and water too."" (Was this a tiny bit of common sense I had not thought of?) She said she was layered up and she was fine. She said when electricity came on sporadically that's when she would quickly cook food. (Was this a second sign of intelligent life peeking through?) We all know when our feet are freezing it makes things 1000% worse; so I told her to put on fuzzy socks (the ones I wanted to burn to keep her from wearing them in public last year) then put gallon ziplok bags on her feet::: then a second pair of ugly fuzzy socks. My tiny piece of advice to save her 72 hour uncomfortablene
ss in college. She never has taken my advice before ('cause she has known everything since she turned 13) but I think she might have just listened to me this time. She called me today to tell me about this post. That tells me she has survived::: figured out a way to keep her cell phone charged and wasn't whining or complaining about any of the stuff I read on this thread.

"A message from President Denise Trauth

Dear Bobcat Parents and Guardians:::

I want to personally say that I am deeply concerned about the well-being of our students during this very challenging weather event occurring in Texas. The safety of our students is our top priority::: and we are doing everything in our power with the resources available to address their needs.

- Our Housing staff are on-site in affected residence halls to monitor conditions and help students to stay warm.
- We cannot open other large indoor spaces on our campuses such as the University Events Center or LBJ Student Center for warming centers because they are also impacted by the rolling blackouts.
- University Dining can only provide to-go meal options through Harris and Commons dining halls from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily.
- Two shuttles are located at the Lantana Bus Stop::: and two are at the corner of Reed and Moore Streets near Blanco Hall. The shuttles are available overnight::: but we ask students to not plan on spending all night on the busses. All COVID-19 safety precautions::: including wearing a face covering::: must be followed in the shuttles.
- We are working to restore several disrupted networks::: including the university-wide phone system.

Students living off-campus in San Marcos can find information about local warming stations and shelter at these links:

Our university staff is working around the clock to provide critical services to our students.",2/17/2021 21:30,Thank you for your genuine concern for the well-being of all the students::: as a mom of a Bobcat I truly appreciate all you are trying to do during these unprecedented times..stay safe all!,Like this year hasn't been hard enough on universities.,Thank you for your concern. But the dorm my daughter is staying in has been plagued with plumbing issues since she moved in in the Fall. This situation did not help with that. Her tuition is paid in full with the expectation that she has a clean::: safe place to live. I guess I had higher expectations for a reputable university in terms of living spaces.,My daughter is a sophomore so of course she lives in a off campus apartment it’s FREEZING they have no power and are scared they have no idea what to do because they are kids. Why isn’t the school helping those off campus why are you guys leaving it up to the city. This is real crappy if you ask me,This is a tough situation. I’m so grateful for the people that are there taking care of our Bobcats! Thank you from the bottom of my heart! ❤️,As a parent I am furious that there has been a lack of communication with parents of students living in the dorms until now. They are without power::: heat::: water and until recently::: food. It is unacceptable that the university did not have emergency plans in place for the safety of the students.,I realize the winter storm is unprecedented::: but a weather disaster in general is not. This is Texas; we have hurricanes and floods and all manner of crazy weather ::: and the fact that TXST doesn’t have a basic emergency plan for the kids required to live in the dorms is shocking. I don’t want to hear excuses for why you can’t do more... I want to you implement a comprehensive emergency plan to take care of the kids you force to live in these dorms.,Traumatic experiences for so many of the students ......I sure hope the professors take this into consideration.,I am so impressed with the University reaching out. I know they are doing everything they can. My daughter is a Bobcat graduate and I would still feel positive of her care in this situation. Hang in there everyone! Prayers to all students at Texas State during this unprecedented times. 🙏🏼🙏🏼prayers,"We understand::: but the conditions and situations these young students are going through are simply unacceptable!..
.we're so mad right now!::: on Thursday morning around 1:00 am our son was evacuated from his dorm and told to go to the nearest dorm which is at least a 10 min walk since the dorms around him were being evacuated as well. It was 28°F with freezing rain on top of it::: and they were told to leave their dorms!!!!? which by the way we still don't know exactly WHY!? It's already bad enough the State dropped the ball by not properly planning for this winter weather that was forecasted::: but it's also clear that TXST University didn't have a plan A or even a plan B for that matter!. The University needs to do better for it's students and not leave them to fend for themselves during these extraordinary circumstances! TXST University you need to do better for our kids!",No one is shooting at them! Their great grandfathers at 18 were fighting their way against the Germans through the snow and my son was fighting in Afghanistan in the snow. Your kids in a dorm in Texas will survive and grow.,Thank you for the update. My daughter and all residents had to evacuate Blanco Hall last night for a reason that wasn’t told to them but nevertheless she was allowed to go back to the dorm about an hour later and she did inform me that the power was restored to their dorm. It’s tough on everyone right now so thank you for doing all that you can to make the students their top priority.,The community seems to be coming together! I have 2 there and it’s a learning experience and some great memories! Keep working together and being good neighbors to each other!,These students are completely overwhelmed. This is the first major event that many of them are facing without their parents. I have heard from my daughter and many of her friends in various dorms that they are not being communicated with. Their only source of information is from their RAs and that is limited. They are cold::: hungry::: stressed about classes and looking for guidance. I understand resources are limited but please attempt to do more to communicate with them directly. My daughter is so stressed about an exam she has on Saturday. She has no internet::: spotty cell service::: power for 30 minutes increments and no hot water. She can not access her Canvas to even begin trying to prepare for an exam and seriously worrying about failing.,A lot of people are saying more can be done but who is expected to do it? People who normally drive the buses or work the food places are TXST students. If those students can’t make it to work then who will do it? The whole state is going through this. Parents could of told their students that a winter storm was coming so they could plan in advance and stock up. Please use this as a learning tool and stop trying to baby your young adult.,"Thank you! My daughter is an RA and takes it very seriously. She has been sharing snacks with residents::: but there’s only so much she can do. Maybe reach out to the community for assistance. I’m sure there are former students/
churches that would want to help!",This is a serious question. I am from California and rolling blackouts here mean power on for 1 hour off for 3 hours. For the last 24 hours San Marcos Hall has had power for 10 minutes every 8 hours. Ten minutes hardly seems rolling so I am asking a serious question as to how rolling blackouts are being administered.,Does anyone know anything about Falls Hall? Do they have power? My daughter is off campus with friends with no lights since Sunday night::: and trying to assess the situation.,Y’all do not care at all about students living in bobcat village,We deserve an update on the heat situation on campus. My daughter has been without heat for a week.,My freshman daughter at Laurel Hall has not had heat this week at all. Although I appreciate the update and certainly the dining hall services::: I wish this had gone out days ago.,My student has not been contacted by an RA. As far as she knows::: she is literally the only person in her building. She just moved into her dorm this semester and has not seen an RA at all. She has 10 minutes of power every eight hours and is too far to walk to the warming shuttles. She tried to walk to Commons today but the way was blocked by ice and caution tape. I am so very frustrated with the lack of communication that has been happening.,While I thank you for this::: it should not have taken 3 days. Do better.,I wish the University would try and do more for off campus students. These are all young adults trying to deal with conditions they are not accustomed to. They are struggling with no power to stay warm or cook meals.,My daughter is in Sayers Hall::: the 1st floor is flooded and my daughter said it smells like gas at a gas station and the water smelled like gas while she was showering. I'm not sure but I have called all major numbers and emailed the campus police dept. I could think of::: but every phone line is down. My daughter even called 911 from her phone but only busy signal::: so I called 911 from Arlington::: Tx and they are having someone dispatched::: praying it's not a gas leak. And their electricity just went back out.,Can off-campus students without a meal plan get food at the dining halls? Very willing to pay::: of course. And can someone please let professors know that the kids have no power or internet? One of my daughter’s professor insisted that they take a test earlier this week...without power or internet.,You can and should provide more food for our kids ! My sons food went bad when electricity went out and had a hard time replenishing and has been starving ! Y’all should get people to deliver at least drinks and snacks to each hall ! He went out today the grocery store was so busy he could not get in it sat in line at Whataburger 3 hours and got no food they ran out ! Come on y’all need to step it up the students said the food is horrible that is being served . I would love to get up there but road conditions will not allow me too my son started sliding going back to parking garage and is scared to leave now ! How do they survive they need food you should reach out to some sources to help theM please !!! I know the weather is not your fault I get it but I feel y’all can do more for your starving students my son takes meds and needs to eat Deliver snacks and have each floor come one floor at a time and help these starving kids out please !!,Are students really losing their spring break due to classes being cancelled this week? Or is that just a terrible rumor?,Nice message but two-three days too late. This university needs an overhaul of its communications with parents and students.,This was given to my daughter today from Harris dining Hall. Looks pretty gross and raw. Deeply disappointed,I just heard from my daughter and found out that the water has been shut off and she cannot get any food. She is hungry and cold and thought that it is better to drive on icy roads to come home than to stay on campus due to the conditions! This is a terrible failure. I have convinced her that she has to stay until tomorrow when the sun will melt some of the ice but I cannot believe that this is the best solution! She said that the food was terrible and the lines were long and not worth standing in.,I’m not a current student. I do have a degree from Tx State and very proud of it. In fact there are many in my family with degrees from Tx State. This ice/snow storm has been tough on EVERYONE. Has it been frustrating? Hell yes!! Has it caused mixed emotions? Yep! The one thing I have witnessed is that people are working hard everywhere to help make others comfortable. I’m sure this is the case at Texas State. I believe::: based on what I have read and been told::: that TSU is working hard and doing their best. God bless everyone everywhere during these times!!,Why is there not a generator on campus to provide warmth? The athletes have one at the stadium and coach’s have been delivering food.,Thank you for the update. Every parent appreciates your full engagement on this issue.,I cant imagine Classes are still being held during this time?,"Off campus housing is in trouble. No food::: no power::: now no gas stations do
The cars are out of gas which was the only way the kids were charging their phones. My daughter is in Red Point.",Can anyone confirm that water has been shutdown in San Marcos?,"My Bobcat got her 3 meals today at the dining hall::: she has some power and at times heat today. Her only complaint was no wifi and a cold shower. She used her survivor skills and is in good shape.
Proud mom in California",How much food is in the to go meals? Kids are hungry::: cold::: and scared. The RAs are doing the best they can but are being expected to be on call 24/7. With all the communication issues (power outages::: phones down::: etc)::: is the university trying to get a senior staff member into each residential hall? To hear reports from the students is not as powerful as having to live through it with them.,she should be in politics with that facility to so easily lie :-(,This is so sad to read. Hope they get help soon.,More should be done. What about not having water? Limited time on the shuttles.?,Thanks for the update::: I've been worried,How about bussing those living in the dorms to the off base shelter??,What happened to Common sense ?,"This is why I created TheGivingWater to HydrateAmerica.

"TXST is deploying shuttles to the Lantana Hall bus stop in San Marcos beginning Feb. 16 at 6 pm. Students living on or off-campus can access the shuttles to warm up. Shuttles will be available overnight::: but we ask students to not plan on spending all night on the busses.

All COVID-19 safety precautions::: including wearing a face covering::: must be followed in the shuttles. Please note there are no electronic device charging capabilities in the TXST shuttles.",2/17/2021 0:45,Has anyone have contact info for university official for these power outages at the dorms,Why wait until 6pm. I haven't spoken with my son all day due probably to no power so how would he know about the shuttle unless someone went door to door. I'm horrified that I have no info. He's only 18 and don't know if he has had food.,Many students are without food due to the dining rooms being closed. They are on meal plans::: please consider asking for emergency help to give out any food available. What can we do to help these students??,This is great; however::: why not place buses in different areas on campus. That is a 15 minute walk for our student! She has been without power for several hours! She was able to take advantage of food at the dining hall.,From what I’ve seen on social media::: almost none of the roads are accessible for cars due to ice. Texas state sits on a hill::: it may be physically impossible for busses to reach certain places on campus. The lantana dorm bus stop is at the bottom of the hill.,That’s great::: but how does it help just having the one location and students have to walk back to their dorms across campus,They need to have abus available at every dorm some students don't even know where that hall is!!!,"Texas State::: You've dropped the ball!!!
How can people trust you with their children::: When you cannot provide proper care for your students during a crisis?",I agree the school needs to make better efforts for the kids. My son had no power for 2 days and was hungry as well. Not what a mother wants to hear.,TX State should be doing so much better for the students😡They have no problem on orientation days saying all they do and all the services they provide::: and then take our tuition money::: room and board.... there should be rooms::: halls::: gym...w generator power capabilities in place for goodness sake!!! When you have that many teens::: young adults you are responsible for::: that is your duty! Gonna be lots of ticked off parents😡 Shame on you Texas State for not preparing for power outage!,Power has gone out in common student areas in the past such as the student center. Perhaps they don’t have power and that’s why they haven’t opened the buildings up. Just a thought. I used to work in the student center.,"Professors
Please leave our students alone about School. Today is an inclement weather day. Most of them don’t have power and are in freezing conditions while trying to make the best of the situation or even piecing together something to eat. My child included. The Last thing on their mind is completing work to fulfill your grading pleasures. Please don’t send messages to students at this time unless you are showing some concern for your students::: bringing a hot meal or some electricity and WiFi.

Sincerely:::
Freezing Texans 🤷🏾‍♀️",While we dearly love TXST::: it is about time. I was hoping the University would be a warming center::: but we will take this. Some of these kids have been without heat for more than 24 hours. Thank you!,What about students who live far away from lantana in halls like Angelina!? That's pretty far a walk plus while it's freezing! Buses could at least be placed at different locations not just one.,I wonder if campus has power in places like the arena and the student center.,I had to get my daughter a hotel room. The manager didn’t want to rent a room to her because she is under 21. I had to beg...BEG for a warm place for my daughter. I cannot believe there is no university emergency plan other than a few buses. I pray for the students that are hungry and cold. May God have mercy on Texas.,Why can't the shuttle busses shuttle the students to a shelter set up with heat and food? There should be a power to reach out to for help. State emergency. National Guard whatever. There's a lot of kids living 2 and 3 days in inhumane conditions yet warming stations is the only answer? I thought you were the great state of TX! Do what needs done! -angry grandma in Ohio,My son is in a dorm where the heater was not functioning well. Now he is without light making it even worse for him. We are paying so much money for our student to have to go through all this.,My daughter's heat went out 2 days BEFORE the power outage. She's freezing::: with no food::: and no car to warm up in. These kids are FORCED to live on campus their first year! Angelo State has opened up lobbies for those without power and food is brought to the dorms.,My daughter says there's no campus WIFI. She cannot get on the internet to access Canvas. Is this true? Also::: she says here phone service is unavailable. She has T-Mobile. What cell service providers are working in San Marcos?,It does seem that since we are paying full price tuition for online classes::: State could do better than this. Disappointed on multiple levels.,The university should be making arrangements with the restaurants and food trucks to deliver food,Why isn't the arena open as a warm shelter for students?! Thanks for warming up for 15 min::: now head back to your cold housing? C'mon::: State! DO BETTER! #EatEmUp,My daughter lives 1.5 miles from campus & has no vehicle. Can the school send out a few further out?,I would like to see the TXST open the dining halls to students that live off campus. I don’t mind paying for my off campus student to be able to have a hot meal since the stores aren’t open and most students live on frozen meals.,Does anyone know if Trauth's house has power?,WGU online college this is where my daughter transferred to. She was tired of never getting the classes she needed. She absolutely loves it and is saving so much more money. No longer has to deal with all of this and gets a great deal of support from her mentor❤️ She couldn’t believe the difference and wished she had started out at WGU as it would have saved so much money and time!!! My son is finishing up his Masters with them as well❤️,WTH. MY GRANDDAUGHTER IS FREEZING AND HUNGRY AT BOBCAT VILLAGE APTS. WHAT DO YOU PLAN TO DO ABOUT IT. ITS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR STUDENTS. OPEN A WARMING HALL AND GET FOOD TO THEM. YOU NEED TO CREDIT THEIR ACCOUNTS FOR NOT PROVIDING SAFE HOUSING.,What else is availae except beside warming up on a bus for 15 minutes and no descent food to eat(mystery box) that we::: as parents:::::: still have to pay for?,"Texas A&M University in College Station opened a warming station on campus for students—Reed Arena::: the basketball stadium.

!!!",No offense to anyone::: but being without power for a few hours isn’t that big of a deal. Don’t any of these students own coats? Have blankets? I’d be more worried about food than anything else::: but I’ve seen how obese most students are so they’re gonna be just fine.,Hang in there::: Bobcats. 🐾,"So very disappointed in Texas State. You shut down and washed your hands of any responsibility for our kids. They are cold and hungry. Many had to walk to the HEB in the cold and wait 2+ hours to get food. I’M ALREADY PAYING YOU TO FEED MY KID! Before this natural disaster hit::: we considered picking our daughter up. But we felt she would be safer there because you have maintenance on site and dining halls. When we realized Texas State had abandoned all those students::: it was too late to come get her and her friends. We are beyond angry at the administration.
What you did/didn’t do was dangerous! ...Oh::: and the warming stations are at least two days too late.",With no campus WIFi and T-Mobile cell service down::: my daughter cannot check campus email.

I see an email from one professor saying the next exam may open early next week.

Texas State University",2/16/2021 21:24,We are paying quite a bit of money for this experience. I hope the University develops a plan to deliver food to kids in dorms without heat::: a warming station and pickup stations for students in apartments. If we could get to our children::: we would. Since we can’t::: we are paying you to provide the shelter and food for them.,As an out of state parent I must say that I am so very disappointed and angry with the University’s response. The lack of communication is unforgivable. We are getting ZERO updates on what the plan is (shuttle buses for intermittent warmth is NOT a plan),My student is in the dorm with no food. We the parents would like to be informed on the plan for them.,There are professors still requiring assignments to be turned in this week. many students have no power::: no heat::: little or no internet::: yet professors are not extending deadlines. What is going to be done about that?,My daughter is there alone as well::: with no power::: no food::: please check in on them! The dining hall wasn’t open when she tried today::: yesterday went to commons and it was closed but icy to walk around::: fell on ice a couple of times- and couldn’t go further. Besides the fact she was froze after a few minutes- hands and face numb::: red::: stiff::: not safe!! Can y’all not salt/sand sidewalks so they are able to get across campus to food? Or bring them food so they don’t have a 15minute plus walk on ice? And let them know what is open and when. This lack of information should all be passed to them. She was also concerned with no power how the key passes to get into dorm would work-y’all should make sure this info is passed on in these types of situations.,You guys haven’t sent an email advising parents what you all are doing to help our kids out. My kid called me he is cold::: hungry and has no idea what to do. He wants to come home. Please help our children!! We pay a lot of money for our kids to attend this university. How are there no backup generators for the dorms. You guys must do better!!!,How are you handling meals for the students in the dorms?,I mean::: they've been sending your kids to covid-filled classrooms to learn::: why do you think they're going to take care of them now? Texas State doesn't care about the wellbeing of their students::: they just want their money.,Anyone have kids at bob cat village apartment? My daughter is alone doesn’t know anyone. maybe they can all get together with blankets::: flashlights::: batteries and ride this out. She has groceries and a neighbor has a grill. I’m just a worried mom and 7 hours away!,Can you please make a statement about any plans to take care of our kids stuck in your cold dorms with nothing to eat? Your faculty are not communicating with my student at all-\-\and I'd hope it would be about survival instead of schedules,Yes we need an update on their food situation.,Texas A&M University in College Station opened a warming station on campus for their students. Any chance of Texas State University doing the same for their students?,Does anyone know how long the power in that area will be off,My daughters in San Marcos hall. Electric just came on. Why are no administrators or faculty answering questions or giving updates. Step up txst::: you have a lot of worried parents. We can’t get there::: so we are trusting you to take care of our kids,I have a student off campus w no electricity. Are any cafeterias open?,Will library fines be waived since the campus will be closed? I have a book due on the 18th.,Looking for a status of dining services for our kids on campus?,Any plans to have a warming station for students on and off campus since most are without power ?,Will the health center be open? I have an appointment to get a covid test,My student reports that one dining hall is out of food and one has a line an hour long. Her refrigerator food has spoiled due to no power for hours. What is the University’s plan to feed the kids?,Information on warming stations please!,Does anyone know if the Timber Apts. got power back running?,Rebecca Castillo,🙏,Sean Angle Christina Quakenbush,🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏,There are students in your dorms with no food::: please reach out to them!,My Daighter room temperature is freezing.She in the bed with several outfits on.

Safety & Emergency Communications",2/14/2021 19:27,Please treat the stairs outside the dorms and other areas for student safety,Anyone know who I need to report a power outage to for Bobcat village? I can’t get a hold of anyone in the housing division,Busses and “to go”food is NOT cutting it TX State! Feed the kids better::: fresh water::: those buses should be taking them to a shelter::: not sitting there for a few at a time to warm up and go back outside to walk 10-15 to a cold apt or dorm😡,So our freshman kids who are required to stay on campus have no access to food because the dining halls are closed! You all need to do better in preparing for this sort of situation power is out and they have no food!,Not everything had been cancelled. Some profs are continuing on their normal schedules. Online exams are still happening tomorrow for some students. Praying the power stays on and on-campus students can get to dining halls eventually.,Thank you for doing this. Please make sure your essential workers are really truly essential and do what you can to help them get safely to and from work. Keep all the bobcats safe!,Many students off campus are also without power have been for over 24 hours. I am one of them. We have multiple students in my complex. It's not just the campus students that are affected. We don't have access to food because many of us lost food we had in our refrigerators due to the power outage. Many emergency services are having to direct manpower to nursing homes and the hospitals to make sure our elderly and sick still have oxygen and emergency care services. Whole section of the city itself have been without power since Sunday night.,The fact that we had to put our daughter in a hotel room at the very last minute because she stated there was no electricity::: no food shows how unprepared you all are. We are far away from her and this is something we are suppose to trust you with great job on y’all’s part!,When will the power be back on in San Jacinto? Who is communication with our children? How are they suppose to stay warm?,Is anyone fixing heat at San Jacinto Hall? My student said no heat since Thursday.,Is there anyone monitoring this website at Texas state? If so::: why is no one helping students? Do you GET that there is no power and the windows in their dorms or apartments have ice on the INSIDE? I’ve called motels and they don’t answer. Uber is not working and streets are unsafe. Anyone reading this from Texas state answer please. I’ve called many phone numbers with no answer or busy signal.,Where is the University President? Keep track of who is helping and who is hiding. I suggest a peaceful demonstration at his house.,The campus police number goes to a busy signal. So no one really cares what happens to these students.,And the pres and other administrators are probably at their home and have no clue whats going on in the dorms or apts around campus😡,It was not clear in the email that classes are canceled—just that buildings are closed. I’m lucky I saw this post::: but it would be helpful to be more explicit in the email.,For students living on campus::: will there be any food services available?,Please treat the sidewalks on campus especially for those living in dorms. It’s like trying to walk on an ice rink to get to the dining halls.,My child is at the Junction apt with the power going on and off. This is unacceptable.. our kids shouldn’t freeze whatsoever. I put my daughter up in a hotel for the night.,Texas State has dropped the ball again!,Got an email about noon Tuesday. Major network issues due to power outages. Campus phone system expected to be down until Thursday.,Texas State power plant boasts of their efficiency! The university has once again dropped the ball!,Possibly going to put my kid up in a hotel room since the power is still out at the dorms. Does anybody have an idea how the streets are in San Marcos getting around?,Why are the students being evacuated right now at 1 AM !,Did anybody try contacting campus police? I keep getting busy signal every time I call.,You know::: you wouldn't have to cancel anything if you were fully remote. 🤷‍♀️,We have a student who is hurt and low on food in Gillardia we have tried calling ever number they are all busy even campus police what can we do,Are there any buildings open for students who are living off campus and have no power?,The dining halls are closed?!? How are the kids in the dorms supposed to eat if they are on meal plans? Is the university delivering food to the dorms? Just asking...,Do the dorms have heat? Anyone know?,Anyone know of a delivery service to campus dorms?,Christina Quakenbush,Amy Warner,⛄️,Jadea Bedford Sean Bedford,My daughter is now stuck in her dorm for 4 days with heat that barely works. Not good.,Alyssa Villarreal,Thank you thank you thank you,Sean Angle,Lanette Moncada,Diana,Arrianna Cruz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

18 January::: 12:55 ·

The legacies of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King::: Jr. and President Lyndon B. Johnson will forever be connected. Dr. King was America’s most prominent leader of the Civil Rights Movement. He is widely remembered for his “I Have a Dream” speech from the Lincoln Memorial::: for his “Letter from Birmingham Jail:::” and for his direction of nonviolent protest and resistance. His leadership and inspiration were keys to the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act in 1965::: both of which were signed into law by President Johnson. In a stirring speech to Congress on March 15::: 1965::: pressing for passage of the Voting Rights Act::: President Johnson emphasized Dr. King’s words::: stating that “it’s all of us who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice. And we shall overcome.”

The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King was awarded the 1964 Nobel Peace Prize for his nonviolent activism against racial inequality and injustice. In his acceptance speech::: he said: ""I accept this award on behalf of a civil rights movement which is moving with determination and a majestic scorn for risk and danger to establish a reign of freedom and a rule of justice. […] After contemplation::: I conclude that this award which I receive on behalf of that movement is a profound recognition that nonviolence is the answer to the crucial political and moral question of our time – the need for man to overcome oppression and violence without resorting to violence and oppression. […] I believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word.""

Dr. King was assassinated in Memphis::: Tennessee::: on April 4::: 1968. He was just 39 years old.

Lyndon B. Johnson was 36th President of the United States. He is Texas State University’s most distinguished alumnus::: having graduated in 1930. He earned the university’s first Distinguished Alumnus award in 1959.

Martin Luther King::: Jr. Day is a federal holiday celebrating his life and legacy::: observed on the third Monday of January each year.

On Tuesday::: January 19::: the Texas State University community will celebrate the life and legacy of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King::: Jr. in an online presentation::: 4-5 pm.

Fraternities and sororities faced off in snowball fights on The Quad. The Administration even shipped a box of Texas sized snowballs to a university in Michigan. A bunch of us GDI's went out to Devil's Backbone::: built a bonfire and had the time of our lives. Of course to me it was kind of nightmarish as I had just been discharged from the Air Force and had spent two years at Minot::: North Dakota.,The most beautiful campus in Texas!,It snowed during registration in umm 1981? Cars slid off I35 everywhere all the way from Austin.,Yes::: with the one exception of the library (unless they rebuilt it since I graduated in ‘79). I remember Texas Monthly once listed it as the ugliest architectural building in the state!,Looks beautiful!!,Sarah Regina Smith Lauren Guzman remember when we had a snow day and instead of sleeping in::: we watched Frozen?! 😂,I remember one time it was icy snow and we grabbed what ever we could find like trash can lids and cardboard to use as sleds and slid down the hill by one of the dorms.

""Here the seeds were planted from which grew my firm conviction that for the individual::: education is the path to achievement and fulfillment; for the Nation::: it is a path to a society that is not only free but civilized; and for the world::: it is the path to peace — for it is education that places reason over force.""

Shameful.,Its a sad day to be a Bobcat. This guy is a socialist who like so many other so called professors at institutions of higher learning will indoctrinate his victims with socialist ideology.,"that some of you ""like"" Beto is not enough to give him the credentials to teach at a University. Beto has a Bachelors in English. Not Political Science. In order to teach at a University (exempting graduate students) you have to have a PhD in the respective field.

Beto does not have this. He does not even have a Masters. He is a failed Senatorial candidate::: and an even bigger failure of a Presidential candidate. And while that DOES give him a measure of experience that the typical person does not have::: it does not equip a person to teach others (especially concerning Texas Politics)

""Practice Professors"" should be reserved for people that have a lifetime of experience in a prospective field::: not a few years as a B level politician.","Hey atleast his::: “How to lose a senate race” class will be pretty knowledgeable..
.",😡 As a past graduate of SWTSU::: I am not pleased to read this news about failed political candidate Beto O’Rourke teaching a semester course at TXST. Speaking at 1 class lecture -vs- teaching a whole course is quite a different thing::: and I would consider his teaching of my college student a poor investment of my money. Beto is too much of a progressive liberal and is too biased to be giving students a “well-rounded” political education and then grading them fairly. I would pull my kid out of his class because of his polarizing and radical stances in politics.,"Sad. This is the antithesis of intellectualism
. This hire reflects the death of free thought and more so compliance. ✌️ Texas State",That sums azz should not be teaching anything to the young American minds! Another Democrat trying to warp the minds of our future leaders!! I’m sure it’s right out of their book!!,"The best thing about going to a university is the fact it opens up a person to a world of ideas::: philosophy::: and science. It also means diversity of thought.
Students at Texas State have a choice to enroll (and pay) to take his class.
I went SWT and took several political science classes there. Some professors were extremely vocal in the political ideas::: both conservative and liberal::: but they allowed students to ask questions and come to their own conclusions. We were cognizant enough to formalize our own ideas.
Now this was right after the Vietnam War was over::: so feelings were strong::: and anti military::: but we had our own minds to make up.
O'Rourke is not going to spread propaganda::: but open up discussons.
I say KUDOS to my old alma mater.","For all of you complaining::: I'm sure Trump university would LOVE to steal you and your kid's money instead!

Get yourself an ""education"" at Trump university if you're so bothered by an actual congressman teaching political science at a Texas institution lol",A strong teacher inspires rational::: thoughtful discourse and independent thinking. Through what I've read and heard from him while he was campaigning::: I do not believe he is capable of growing open minds trained to think logically and deeply.,Imagine being so fragile and sensitive that you get offended when a university hires people with actual experience in Texas politics to teach Texas politics just because you don’t agree with their points of view.,I spent six years at Texas State::: earning my degrees::: and I would have loved the opportunity to be taught a subject by someone active in that field. I find it embarrassing how up in arms some people are getting around this decision. Take it for what it is::: an opportunity to learn.,As an alumnus::: I'm disappointed that my alma mater produced all the half wits in this thread. 😀,If you don't like it than I strongly recommend you to enroll your kids at Trump University! Most classes list the professor by the class number::: so if you want to get a different professor than register early and be proactive about your education and 💰!,A failed politician landed a job at TXState. Wow. Great hire. Did the county clerk turn it down?,"I’m proud of this move from my Alma Mater!

I’m glad you haters are mad. Why would they not have a former Presidential candidate::: congressman from Texas and a major party personality teach politics? The fact you don’t get that part let’s me know that you didn’t graduate.

Jerrell Turner check this",Some of y’all are pathetic::: you don’t like the guy ...well then don’t take the class or just pick a different profesor. I’m pretty sure I had a few teachers that were hardcore republican ::: ..so what ::: they didn’t change my mind. I just took the class and did the work,I'm proud of my Alma Mater::: and wish he was teaching when I was there. Kids need to understand different perspectives than what their family is trying to force on them. They need to learn to recognize propaganda::: and the motivation behind politicians claims and positions. All you brainwashed right-wing authoritarian extremists who only want their children to know about what their family believes are doing your children a disservice. They might still support your positions after learning more about all the parties and processes. Educators don't tell them what to think::: they merely show them the system and the rules::: the varying positions::: and the history behind them::: so they can form their own perspective and not be mindless clones who don't know how to defend or discuss their position. What someone believes when presented with the full knowledge of differing positions is up to them in the end.,If you’re worried about a college class brainwashing your kid::: then maybe it’s your parenting skills that should be questioned.,Wow what a bunch of ridiculous comments. Good for you::: Texas State! I’m sure he’ll make a great addition to the staff.,He has every right to get the opportunity. Having constructive blocks of instruction are important. However::: there's no confidence that he'll teach objectively and without undue influence.,"Great move by Texas State University! Eat em up cats! Can yall hire someone that actually knows how to win football 🏈 and basketball 🏀 games next? And i see yall have the Republicans mad - they will redirect their pettiness to Biden when he wins in November.

#MuNuAlphas #TxStateGrad",Welp. Any credibility your university had prior to this (not much) just went down the drain. 😂,As an alumnus::: I’m embarrassed and sad about this decision.,"For all of you saying that you “won’t allow your child to take that class” you are literally saying “I don’t want my child to hear views other than my own. I don’t want them to have the full college experience of making their own choices.”

And guess what? It’s perfectly okay for your children to grow up and have different opinions than you::: and if you shame them for that::: then you’re just a bad parent 🤷🏻‍♀️",This is embarrassing. I’m ashamed to be associated with TXST with this news.,So glad my daughter is graduating. The level of professor competency has severely declined.,I'm sure my grandson will not take that class but I wish he would. He would have Beto's head spinning. Beto would be no match for him.,Sad day for Texas State and as an alumni I am not happy about this decision. Don't call me again asking for money. 😢,Texas State is trying to find an identity::: and looking in all the wrong places.,Time to have my son transfer out and cut off all donations.,Texas State alumni from El Paso::: Texas here !,I am truly disappointed in my alma mater with this disgraceful decision.,Good. The Republicans in the comments should probably rethink their “education”.,I’m ashamed to be an alumni if this is the quality of education the students are now getting. This isn’t a class::: it’s a brainwashing scheme.,But why does the exciting stuff at TXST happen after I’ve graduated?!?! 😭,How to lose Elections 101!,Conservatives are all like “we need diversity of thought in schools!” Then the second their kid might be exposed to even slightly progressive politics::: they go “I refuse to let my child go there” 😂,Getting lessons from folks with real life experiences is wonderful.,Is Texas State making a political statement? Can I take my vote Cruz sign to class?,I guarantee all these parents that say their kid won't take this course will be first in line to take this course,I thought TXST provides good quality faculty staff members?,Omg::: take this school off the list!,What a joke. As an alumnus of the school::: so disappointed to see Texas State bring in someone just to have a moment in the spotlight.,Thankfully both of my girls are done. What a disgrace this once great school has become,Why? I had a few very liberal profs in my day at TXST but this is ridiculous!,Won't pay for my kid to take that class. And as an alumni I am not happy about this decision.,Uhg...will make sure my kids DO NOT take that this Spring!,My kid won’t be in that class,"Projectile podiatry- shooting yourself in the foot.
The TxState motto.","Dont ruin the best school w this fool
!!!!","I’ll never understand why these old folks are worried about who’s teaching at Texas State 😂

Like you had your time 20+ years ago::: worry about your bills::: not who’s teaching at the school you haven’t been to in years.

#proudbobcat",Just laughing at everyone here talking about the “liberal slant” of universities when they haven’t stepped foot on a college campus in 30+ years. 🤷‍♀️,This makes me incredibly disappointed that you have someone so obviously biased teaching influential minds. Any political classes I took as an alumni were unbiased and told the story so the student could make the decision as to their beliefs. Hiring this person was a move to create a marketing stir::: not for the higher education of students. There are far more experienced professors out there.,UTEP must have passed on that dumb idea,If you are conservative::: I have learned you should not send your kids to Texas State. Mine went in conservative and came out a screaming liberal. They teach only one side. That is just not right.,I don’t think a biased opinion should be teaching political science. Especially that far left in the majority right Lone Star State.,He's teaching polutics within Texas::: he is very knowledgable within that criteria. Awesome!,Lots of “Beto Snowflakes” at Texas State . Well::: I guess he sees the writing on the wall that Trump will win the election and therefore won’t be Biden’s “Gunn Czar” MAGA!,What the HELL!!! Our son graduated from Texas State::: and we will no longer be supporting that school financially in any form or fashion!! Pathetic that they would hire such a loon!!,I am so sad that Texas State has stooped so low as to consider such a radial to teach. I am so glad I do not have a family member going there now.,I’m a Texas State Alumnus and I do not approve this message,Sad for Texas State!! As a parent currently paying tuition::: very disappointed.,Jesus Christ this comment section is a dumpster fire. The bigotry and hatred breaks my heart. Lots of y’all seem to forget what an education is about. Good on you Texas State University::: this is a great step towards turning around the general impression that Texans are a bunch of mindless hicks::: although the comment section isn’t helping 😣,Sad.. but no shock here. It's right in line with the majority of the professors these days and for quite some time now. No diversity😢,Sad day for Texas State University. Glad my child has already graduated. Ugh.,Texas State::: you won’t be getting any more of this alumni’s money::: nor will my kids attend college there::: as long you have this scumbag on your payroll. Bye...,"That's just great::: isn't it? What better way to enlist future liberal/
radical voters than to entrench those views into young teachable minds. I am very disappointed in the administrators of Texas State.","As an alumnus of this institution I’m excited to see this! I was there when this school brought a former Klansman to present to the study body and there was absolutely no public outcry like there is about an actual politician teaching politics.

Keep the positive change going TX State - my alumni association checks will be increased and will continue.

Eat’em up Cats!","Disappointed is an understatement.
.. just what we need::: another liberal professor teaching our youth.. But what do we expect - being so close to TU..",Is it a class on how to lose ever major election and still somehow stay relevant?,All of these boomers commenting in disgust and “cutting off all funds” are the problem with this country. Let the guy teach who cares....your kid has a brain and the right to make his/her own choice. Plus I encourage all fellow Bobcats to keep on pushing Texas State on the youth. One of the few places you can get several degrees (partying and education). EAT EM UP,Lesson 1) Money doesn’t buy elections if no one likes you.,As a two time Alumni (BA in 1999 and MA 2009)::: this is a horrible decision. He is a despicable man and part of what is damaging our country and our country’s legitimate credibility. This I am ashamed of of this decision.,Well::: one of the worst presidents graduated from there. Might as well have one of the worst candidates teach there. Oh yeah::: Alumni Assn::: stop calling and asking for money.,He doesn't even understand the constitution and bill of rights but ok. Should have called Dr. Ron Paul or anyone who understands individual rights,Sign me up! Wish I had been able to take O'Rourke for Constitutional Law & Civil Liberties rather than who i Q dropped. Maybe I would have stayed in political science... though not gonna lie::: I love being a HS biology teacher,When I went to Southwest Texas State my minor was Political Science. I don’t ever remember knowing the political affiliations of any of my professors. They encouraged us to think on our own::: research and not just listen to the talking heads::: and make our own informed decisions. Both of my kiddos graduated from Texas State. One is a an ultra left liberal and the other is a centralist moderate. Makes for interesting family reunions.,This is a joke!!! I will not donate 1 penny to this school ever again!!!,I have two degrees at Texas State. I love my Alma Mater. However::: you do have a choice. There is nothing that states that you have to the the class from him. I myself would find another alternative. I do not think he has the communication skills to be able to teach.,Lmao::: was considering returning in a few years but no thanks y'all made that decision for me. Political figures like him have no business teaching. Especially in Texas. Tell him take his liberal views somewhere else. He'll never get our guns.,Congrats to Texas State. I am so glad my daughter chose an institution that is not afraid to grow. I applaud this choice.,Texas State you will never get a DIME from this alum... JOKE...,With all the money in the world::: he still couldn’t win. It is my hope that he tries to encourage the class with his political experiences and not his political views. Indoctrination is not what schools should be about.,"I have a brain and like to use it so I dont have an identity dependendent on a political party.
If you're concerned with your child/students being brainwashed into being this or that by any professor::: then you and probably your child shouldn't be in higher education. Beto will most likely be teaching course about functions of Texas government. The government works the way it does regardless of party. If students can't critically think for themselves they shouldn't be in college.",I’m not on the same page as him politically::: but I certainly think he has a perspective to share on Texas politics. The real question is who will Texas State hire to give the counter perspective to his?,He certainly won’t present both sides of an issue,I love this decision::: and I am a twice over alumni::: as are BOTH my parents::: and the history building is named for my grandmother!!!,Maybe he can teach some of y’all how to get out of a DUI...,"Personally I would not have wanted him as a professor. As an alumnus::: would rather see him at UT than SWTSU/TSU. As an advocate for universities being a forum of ideas - even crappy ones - let him teach.
Would be interesting if they would be as open to a Ted Cruz teaching there? No doubt the students would be triggered beyond belief.",Will he teach a special class on how to run from the police? Just curious. LOL,"Is he going to teach kids how to lose elections!? So sorry I just paid $75 for my son's application!!! Can I get a refund?????????
??","The only way to fight socialism in our education system is to start at the bottom...no more expected public funding fir schools::: all schools move toward vouchers... tax payers put their money into a system that supports our constitution...
from there we establish grounding on our students future... by the time a professor wants to teach the ideology of socialism as a way of the future::: his students will be wiser",As long as he teaches for free... Bc college should be free right? And goodness knows his ideas aren't worth anything; that's why he depended on selling merch.,Glad I went into natural science instead of politics. Bet that grading will be fair..... 🙄😷👏,"Beto is bringing his knowledge of what it takes to go from a council member to the presidential election to future candidates of ALL parties.

He is teaching a class on politics... not ethics. Not theology. Not morality. Political campaigning.

Lots of bellyaching over nothing... as usual.",Is he Co-Teaching with Alexis Texas?,How sad! Shame on you::: Texas State!!!! I’m sure he will teach socialism to the students! Horrible!,I’m curious how many woke sophomores will unironically celebrate the opportunity to hear mansplaining from a white male::: millionaire::: descendant of slave owners.,Pretty disgusting move bringing in an unqualified::: far left socialist that lies. Shameful::: Texas State!,"As an Alumni I'm not too happy about this!
Not at all....
Only Liberal views will be taught and this Felon isn't one to lecture anyone about anything!",Terrible person::: Terrible idea. As an alumni::: this will cause a full stop to any of my donations.,I was always proud to say I went to Southwest Texas State... never again will I support this school in any form or fashion.,Hey! If you want someone to teach your kid how to crawl out from under a rock and be a total disgrace to Texas...meet professor Francis! What a POS.,Settle down::: everyone! First off::: sounds like he’s going to teach about the political system in Texas::: not any particular political policies. Secondly::: even if he were teaching about policy::: if your poli sci student only wants to learn about half of the political spectrum::: they’re going to have a hard time making a career in political science.,No problem hiring him as long as he can be as objective as a Supreme Court judge is expected to be. If he can respect students’ ideas that differ from his- okay. He was VERY passionate about his democratic views. Seems like it will be a stretch for him to put all that fire in his soul for his party::: behind him and be objective. I’m not sure I would advise my conservative son to pick him as a professor. Although::: I think we would all be hard pressed to find a conservative teacher in any history class all over America.,Teaching politics but only loses elections. Those who can::: do. Those who can't::: teach. I guess it's true.,No thank you! Not good for Texas state at all. Not very proud of my school.,What a lot of folks seem to be missing is that students can CHOOSE which classes they take. They want to take his class? Great. Don’t want to take his class? Totally fine. Y’all need to calm down with the vitriol 🙄,This is great news!!!! I graduated from Southwest Texas State University and now my daughter and my money go to Tx State!!!!! Go Bobcats,🤦‍♂️ Yet another reason I hope my kids go anywhere but TXST. There is no school in TX that has gone this far left. Please stop calling me for money::: you’ll get no more from us.,This is absurd. This guy is a tool and should be far far away from SWT,Worst decision you’ve ever made. I always felt like my students had party neutral professors at Texas State. You are just inviting controversy and trouble. I will not be supporting you anymore.,This is ridiculous. He is an ultra liberal Democrats that will inject his ultra left beliefs on students. There are too many liberal professors on campus who try to indoctrinate their socialist views. 🤦‍♀️,He is no where near a good politician. This is disgusting. More left leaning rhetoric being spewed. Sad sad day. Paying for his class is paying for socialism.,Poor students parents need to avoid them even considering your kids his ‘class’.,There goes that school::: I can mark that one off..fucktards are trying to ruin Texas,I should say the second time....the first was when they changed it from SWT. Oh well::: at least SHSU and SFA didn’t wimp out.,I graduated from Southwest Texas State University. Different school. I’ll never tell anyone I went to Texas State🤢,He should be running for an elected position again. I thought he didn’t run again this year because he wanted to spend more time with his family?,Whatever this assclown “teaches” know the opposite is true. Failure 101.,Beto is as about as moderate as they come! If you think he is a socialist::: you are grossly misinformed.,At least he has realized he doesn’t stand a chance in politics anywhere else 🤷🏼‍♀️,Wow....no words - looks like all political science majors/ minors will not get an unbiased education. Not a good direction to go::: in my opinion.,O'Rourke is most notable for his 2018 campaign for United States Senate::: in which he narrowly lost to Republican incumbent Ted Cruz. #qualifiedtxst,Welp::: there goes any chance of me supporting the alumni association.,Statistically a higher education means a further left leaning political stance. Last I checked::: this is still a university where your kids learn and grow. If they grow out of a few political views::: clearly they were too limited to hold on to with their new knowledge.,This is a political funding of his future campaign and perhaps even a relocation to run in our area as Our representative which he should not be allowed to do. The President of Texa State should be fired for this.,Disgusting. Glad I’m graduating soon. That communist needs to get out of Texas and go live in commie loving CA. This is just one more proof that TXST is a liberal cesspool that worships at the feet of socialism. And by the way::: his name is Robert Francis.,If my daughter was still there I would yank her out immediately. Disgraceful,Texas State::: have you lost your minds? All this will add to the liberal indoctrination of our young students.,This is a Very sad day! I would pull out if still going to school there!,Hell::: I say sign up for the class and then challenge him every time he says something Liberal. Every Single Time! That'd be fun. Get your money's worth !,My wife and I both went to Texas State( South West Texas) This upsets us! No more money from us! My grandsons won’t be attending either🤬,I’m deleting any reference to you as my alma mater. Honestly you might be the most embarrassing school. Anytime I see a story about students acting like entitled children it’s almost always at TX State. So congrats on being a laughing stock. Glad I attended in the double directional days when college was affordable so I didn’t give you too much of my money. 🙄,I'm sure future students can expect a balanced presentation from an overt partisan 🤔,How to implode a campaign by filming your dentist appt.,VOTE EARLY AND IN PERSON if you can. Trump and his cronies (Barr and DeJoy plus Republican legislators and Governors) will do anything to contest paper ballots and steal the election. Defeat Trump way BEFORE NOV. 3. MAKE YOUR VOTE COUNT!,So glad my son is graduating this year. I would die if this man was teaching my child.,I am one of the few::: the proud::: the alumni but don't ask me for money again.,Unbelievable! This is not the SWT nor Texas State that I knew. Is the greater problem lying in the HR::: or search committee::: or faculty? Did anyone throw red flags in the hiring process?,So glad my kid is graduating in May. Worst hire ever. I’m so disappointed in Texas State,This guy is such a pathetic joke! Thank the Lord that so many young people I've met that were forced to listen to fools like this in college lecture courses::: played along::: got their grade and moved on::: not accepting any of the BS cartoon characters like this try to push on them.,Heaven help us! Glad my son has already graduated.,This school just went down a couple notches😂😂::: this is what’s wrong with our country now::: radical nut jobs teaching at college level and the young Americans soaking up their ignorance 🤦🏻‍♂️,Will he offer it in español?,Wow that’s just depressing. Is he going to teach Spanish as well!? Another liberal professor no surprise.,The class will not be called “Winning Elections/ Nominations”.,Wow::: he sure fell. Can you really be considered a presidential candidate if nobody took you seriously? Anyway::: why can’t he teach at Utep,Sick how the universities have caved into creative education,Will he be fair and unbiased?,"Anyone that runs a campaign based off something as unconstitutiona
l as “hell yes we’re going to take your guns” should be teaching history::: or anything else...",First you change the name of my alma mater now this...bye bye(that goes for my money too),Every person has something to teach you. No matter if you agree or don't agreed with their views.,Oh heck no! Come on Texas State you can do better than this! 😡😡,This stinks::: I’m not happy. The closest celebrity we had teaching when I went to school was Tim O’Brien - but he was a world renowned author::: is Beto a world renowned author?? No::: hmm kinda feels like a PR stunt,Every decade or so Texas State needs a good serving of some the El Paso experience and charm. Cool move!,"And we wonder why the university systems continue to pump our young people's heads full of socialist::: Marxist fodder.

May I present Exhibit A?",My alma mater has been making questionable devious for a long time. There is a reason I do not support the idiots and cleptocrats.,Good move. The man gained a wealth of hands on political experience in a short time and should share it with his students.,My son was going there next fall::: not anymore.,Keep Texas Red::: keeping our instructors Red is a good start. He knows Texas and will be a good place to fix what California has been doing.,Highly liberal dean = highly liberal curriculum. While i don’t love it::: perhaps it’ll give students perspective they need to form their own thoughts and opinions.,I cant wait to start in spring!!! I have my TX Politics but that's awesome he'll be teaching potential students and future politicians,He needs a job and isn’t qualified to do anything else. How does the saying go? Those who know do::: those who don’t know teach.,Watching all the conservatives melt down is fun. Cope.,Those people won’t get educated::: they will be indoctrinated. He couldn’t teach my dog to pee!!!,TX State is considered to be such a low end...avg joe lower tier school....the only uni to invite him... he is toxic to so n many other unis No other respectable uni would take him.... he asked just about every top 10 school in Texas don’t want him so TX State can have him!,This Alum will not be supporting the University anymore.,"My kid is super excited! He’s the third group in line for class selection after disabled students and honors seniors as an honors junior. 🙌🏻🙌🏻
PS. I’m not a democrat but he’s my adult kid. He’s not me.",If my child got this person as a professor - I would pull her from the University! He is a sick human!,Well Texas State is already in a culture of exploiting the identity formation of developing emerging adults.,His qualifications would be WHAT?,Is he teaching skateboarding classes as well?,"Couldn't get a job at UT:::lmao:::shouldn

Let the voices be heard. Beto is not welcomed on the campus.,Is he going to teach how to use eminent domain on old Hispanic neighborhoods to build a Whole Foods and other trendy corporate interests?,Is he going to give lectures on how to funnel campaign contributions to personal bank accounts? He's really good at that.,After graduation::: he stayed in New York City for a brief time::: taking on miscellaneous jobs::: including working at an art moving company and being a live-in babysitter before becoming a proofreader at the book publishing company H.W. Wilson Company.,I expect this reaction. Same school who welcome David Duke to come speak when I was there.

The drill team also performed as a part of Trump’s inauguration festivities.
Good universities provide a balanced perspective; inviting orators from a variety of different backgrounds to discuss ideas.

Goodbye to your Republican donations dumbasses!",Me either::: Wayne Whittington!,So much for that class!!!!,Ugh can I withdraw my child?,How can Texas State University justify having someone so blatantly biased to either side teaching students about politics? People like Ted Cruz and Beto O’Rourke should be barred from influencing developing minds in a scholastic setting. College is supposed to teach you how to think::: not what to think.

Wasn't he going to be biden's GUN CZAR? Nope!!,More brainwashing from the left!,As an alum::: boo. Bad choice,Do all of you saddened::: disappointed parents and alumni realize that TSU was and is still flourishing because of a liberal democrat? In case you skipped your government::: history::: and political science classes to float down the river::: or attend a drunken frat party::: LBJ graduated from Texas State. He and his wife::: Ladybird::: funded and continue to donate money (oh::: yes::: they have passed::: in case you didn't know that)::: still. I'm sure that you would have stopped donating if LBJ were younger::: still on this earth::: and teaching a political science class. Yes::: my fine fellow Bobcats. TSU continues to thrive because of a liberal Democrat.,This is why I dont donate,Really?🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️,FFS people have an open mind.,It’s like Mick Jagger teaching Sexual Abstinence course.,Are you kidding me???,This is exciting!!! Love me some Beto. #proudbobcat,How dare you hire a real politician to teach political science! What's next? An architect who has worked in the field to teach architecture? A composer to teach music? If you tell me you've hired actual medical professionals to instruct our nursing students I'm going to lose my mind!,My question to all of the people hating on Texas State for this. Are your political views so warped that you don’t believe in your children learning different points of view? Political Science is a course for learning how to debate both sides of an issue. If you are so one sided that you get upset and are unable to defend your point of view then you are just a sheep following whatever mass you follow and unable to think for yourself. My son and I have very different political views. He is a debater. He listens to the other side::: does research and creates his stand. This is what Political Science teaches. Not that I want my kid to be republican::: or democrat::: and therefore they can only be taught by someone who shares my political view. Sad day.,Cool more Brain Washers!,It seems like a lot of people forgot he was a Congressman. I think it's great to have someone who worked in Congress::: ran for Senate::: and for President to teach a course on politics. It doesn't matter if he lost the most recent races::: he has invaluable insight and experience and that's more than most professors can say.,i’m sorry but this is ridiculous. public universities should be non partisan and to have a very outspoken democrat who was actually a political candidate teach is irresponsible and i will not feel okay or safe on campus if he teaches. this is such a bad decision and i hate this school now,This is ridiculous::: TXST you should be ashamed! Luckily my son graduated last year::: because I would not spend another dime at this university if this true. Students in his classes will be brainwashed with his radical socialist ideology. Just call the class Antifa 101,"Will he teach students how to escape paying taxes like his mother did? While discussing how wants to raise taxes and how that will improve local businesses::: especially in a pandemic.
Sounds like a learning experience for sure!",How is he qualified to teach Texas politics when he can't even win an election to get into politics??,"Say ""libtard"" one more time and let's talk about how YOUR political views are LITERALLY destroying the planet we live on. Your children's inheritance is literal garbage.","Well::: it WAS named ""The Party College"" and we know this clown likes to do such things. Sadly::: a lot of GOOD people helped fund that college in hopes it would hire a ""Better class of professors"". They were WRONG.","Everyone make sure you overload SWTSU (millennials call it TEXAS STATE ) phone lines come Monday with your discontent for this loser on campus.

u have fun.",As an alumnus I am pissed about this decision. O'Rourke not only disagrees with the Constitution::: that is his right::: but he goes over the line and posits himself as seditious by actually wanting to prevent the rest of us from its promise. The Bill of Rights are sacred to the American experience and continues to be with its people. Leftists::: and by that I mean wide-eyed zealots::: believe they have the right to tell me the 2nd Amendment should be removed from the Constitution. Don't expect me to send another dime to this school. I was pissed enough when you changed its name::: this severs all my relations with this school. Not even LBJ actually worked to destroy the Constitution but for some reason you think this silly man has something to contribute.,Name one socialist country that is still successful and people aren't eating out of garbage cans.,He should teach ‘how to live with abject failure’,Texas State 🤡🤡🤡 University! 🤣 Squash the Beto Mosquito with a fly swatter!,Then I thought he like black people why not black hbcu,As alumni::: my family are PROUD to hear this! 👍👏👏👏,This tell me he does think Biden will win...,That's awesome! 👏👏👏,Glad so went there in the 70s instead,Half wit signed up by a half wit school.,Danielle Manson,sigh Connor Cauley,"For tutorial/

::: Bobcats Class of 2020. Bryttaney Luna",Absolutely no effort was put into making this virtual commencement memorable. So disappointing.,It’s almost like the commencement ceremony was more about speeches and formalities than actually focusing on students. Students that put 4+ years of their time and money::: and countless hours of hard work to have to follow several links on the Texas state website rather than it being broadcast. How hard is it for a massive university to actually put together a slideshow and put it online? As an alumni to this university I am very disappointed in my alma mater for this flop. I want to apologize on behalf of my university for this disservice::: and congratulate all of you for your hard work. You all deserve better than you got.,I’m sorry Texas State but your virtual commencement part with each student’s name was trash. You couldn’t even enlarge the screen and literally lasted 1 second.

"TXST is revising the fee structure for online & hybrid classes to meet the needs of our students dealing with financial difficulties as a result of COVID-19. This change will waive more than $7 million in fees for our Bobcats.

Learn more: bit.ly/3gupnGt",7/31/2020 18:23,"Students who signed up for online courses do so with the contractual understanding that they must pay the 'Electronic' (online) course fee. Students who register for in-residence (live instruction) classes do so with the understanding that there will be no additional::: unadvertised/
hidden costs. If TXST makes changes to the class format after students have registered::: with the requirement that students must pay a penalty fee resulting from that format change::: how is this different than any other business (TXST/all colleges are businesses) adding a fee/cost to a previously contracted purchase of a good or service? Universities routinely enjoy considerable latitude in the way they add ""additional fees"" at billing to advertised costs::: however this issue does not follow the ""operational costs"" rationale normally embraced. When TXST elected (they were not mandated) to change course formatting to online::: they should bear any associated fiscal or physical challenges.","Congratulations

Will check back on her account again.",Texas State I am so disappointed in you especially how you have handled the covid situation in regards to students and their online classes. I know of multiple universities who have actually given students the OPTION of wanting to take classes online or in person. You don’t give them an option and now you want to make them pay more!? This doesn’t make you look any better! All your doing is scamming students! Next time I get asked if students should attend Texas State I will gladly say no! It’s a beautiful campus::: I’ve had amazing memories here but Texas State as a school is trash!,Hi all::: my friend::: her family and one of my relatives are just diagnosed wiyh coronavirus last week. I feel it is speading out faster than ever. I feel really unsafe going back to normal classes even I miss the campus so badly. I registered all classes for in-person teaching and then I got emails from school switching all of those to online without any of my will and charged me more electronic fee. I feel my neck stuck in somewhere that I could not air my voice out to deny it as I don't have any choice but pay whatever I am asked for to complete my degree. Anyone have an idea to raise our voice?,Todd Muehe,Monte Greene,"My daughter just got charged $50 per credit HOUR per class that is online. Guess what? All of them are online because every single one was switched to online after she had registered for in person. So now my tuition bill is an extra $750!! For shame #texasstateunive
rsity Way to go full on cash grab during a global pandemic.",I am disgusted to be a student right now. This behavior and blatant disregard for students is repulsive and makes me ashamed at my choice of university,All fees should be waived. Athletic fee::: administrative fee::: even medical fees. For 4 years::: I never went to your doctors for any medical assistance so should I pay it. I have my own medical insurance.,"This does not help those of us who are forced to take only online courses!! My classes are not available for in person this semester even though that’s what I originally signed up for!
DO BETTER Texas State 😒😒😒",Thanks for waiving 342$ in on campus fees::: but charging 600$ in online classes fees... that’s pretty thoughtful of you.,Ima put this on tik tok and make it go viral. 🙄,How is this fair::: TXST::: that a student can sign up for 15 credit hours of in-person courses and YOU decide that ALL of those courses will be online only::: and YOU decide that all on-line courses will require an extra fee? My student had her last course switch just yesterday to on-line only and is now frantically searching for ANY of her courses to be available at another time/date that she can switch to just to avoid SOME of the fees YOU are opting to charge. There is no way that there are fixed on-line learning costs per student that add up to the amounts you are charging given that enormous amount of students that are being forced on-line. Shame on you::: TXST::: for trying to profit from the misery of this pandemic.,Nothing surprises me at this point!,Why pay for online classes when you're going to look up academic material on YouTube anyway?,These students don’t have a say in whether their classes go online. And they’re charged $50/hr for online classes. And::: maybe I read it wrong::: but did it not say that if ANY of their classes were face-to-face::: then the online fee would be waived for all classes? I honestly hope I misread that::: because that it 100% unfair!!!,So you wave at 300 fee and charge 50 per credit hour. Will recreational facilities::: library usage::: sporting fees all be waived since most of these will be unavailable?,Why are we paying for an athletic fee! That should be waived,Move in person classes online and charge more for them. 🤦‍♀️,It’s extremely clear the school is waiting to get payed. Now that they have slowly are moving senior classes on line. 🤪,$50 per credit hour X 15 hours = $750 for online classes. 🤬🤬🤬,"I am not happy with TxState fee reconstruction.
It is about to start the fall semester and I got the email from them to add more fee to the tuition for online classes. How does it make sense? The school needs to work harder to maintain their financial income over the pandemic::: and their students have to figure out how to pay their tuition and keep their student status even their family have lost their job::: but the school wants those student to pay more to maintain their dream profit to satisfy all the their board. If they still offer face-to-face classes::: they are supposed to expect more incurring cost such as sterilizing the room after each class::: and also for their shuttle system to make sure the safety for their students::: and so on. And switching to online classes will help them save those cost. On top of it::: building the online courses is also one of their future steps to expand their education for online degree::: and also reduces the cost to maintain their physical facilities for students and staff. I really want to go protest against those changes. It is selfish.",Still waiting to get reinvestment of from from the spring semester,My classes are more than ever this semester.,The fees should be refund for the semester that they didnt use the facility.this is so unfair.,It makes NO sense that we have to pay extra for online classes. This is outrageous. This is not fair for anyone. Texas State truly doesn’t care about their staff/students.,Texas State needs to do better by their students not fail them. Remove all the fees.,Love the option of hybrid for us in person learners. I lost all motivation for my classes back in the spring when everything went online.,Step in the right direction::: but not good enough. All online and in-person fees should be waived this semester. You can afford to take more than a $7 million hit.,I did the math comparing what tuition was originally supposed to be and what my tuition estimate says and y’all added $445. Don’t listen to Texas State::: they just want your money without any protests.,just so I’m clear. The classes I signed up for back in august that were in person::: and just last week transferred to online::: I now have to pay a fee for.....? Make it make sense,The price should be the same for online classes! People don’t want to pay to risk their children’s life. Texas State has done a horrible job since the pandemic started. You ruined graduation for May graduation and continue to do the wrong thing now. #TexasStateFail,So::: basically:::::: those of us taking all online classes in the interest of safety are forced to pay hundreds of additional dollars?! Thanks::: TXST!,So why are we paying for the computer service fee::: and athletics fee if were 100% online?,What happens if our classes get moved to online ones halfway through the semester again?,How about you stop being stingy and waived all fees and unnecessary fees::: refund us the fees that weren’t used after we went online completely during Spring 2020! This is not that hard. You boast about that multi million dollar COVID grant you got::: yet you aren’t using it to help us. Not only that but this tactic is misleading and you know it!!,At least they’re doing something y’all calm down,This isn’t a discount at all. It’s a slick way to increase fees,Online fees should be waived! This is not the fault of students that classes are changed to online. We did not choose online classes yet you charge us for them?? You make us pay for a pandemic? That’s disgusting and unfair.,"This is a good start. I do think that it needs to be reevaluated::: specifically the following fees:
- sports
- medical services (unless this also covers counseling::: in which case can be removed from the list
- student services
- computer services
- athletics",How about making it retroactive for summer session? It's the least you can do.,This is not ok. Those fees should be waived completely. Online classes use the same platform: canvas and tracs::: as do face to face. Students use their own laptops and internet while taking online classes. It costs the university less for online classes than face to face with having a classroom for electric and cleaning. Texas State is not helping their students in anyway to deal with this deadly virus and it’s sad. They will lose a lot of enrollment because of it.,How about the fees for the summer online classes we took?,From my understanding for some students you will end up paying more because of how many credit hours you take. Kind of a bummer.,No mention of the added fees for online classes? The email TXST sent out today said that all of your classes were online for this coming semester we are going to be charged $50 per credit hour. Then they said they would take $342 off from on campus fees. Meaning that if I take 15 credit hours online::: I will be charged $408 after the waived fees. This post is incredible misleading and I am disappointed with the Universities response to COVID-19.,"So I’m paying more for online classes than I would be paying on campus?
-$342 since I won’t be on campus but +$450 since all 3 of my classes are online..",Thank you for this consideration.,That is a very nice thing to do.,About time::: but they should also refund us the fees from summer & spring.

WHY am I being charge for a $463 summer athletic fee when the gyms have been closed all summer???,"China's new Hong Kong national security law expands across the world

It is not just Hongkongers who are affected by the new so-called national security law. According to China::: it's everyone in the world.

Article 38 says that this Law shall apply to offenses committed against #HongKong from outside the region by a person who is NOT a permanent resident of Hong Kong.

And article 29 says that people who “provoke hatred” towards the Chinese regime or Hong Kong government could be given a life sentence.

Therefore this law affects not only Hong Kong residents::: the 80:::000 American citizens::: or the 30:::000 UK citizens living in the region... But even foreigners who live outside of Hong Kong can be charged for things like speaking at a pro-Hong Kong rally::: writing an op-ed article criticizing Beijing::: or pushing for sanctions against China.

Such people are at risk if they travel to #China or simply transfer flights in Hong Kong.
Experts say the law is even broader than China’s own criminal legislation.

George Washington University law professor Donald Clarke wrote that Beijing ""is asserting extraterritoria
l jurisdiction over every person on the planet.""

NTD",Sad to see my alma matter make such a dumb decision to send students and faculty back to campus in the middle of a pandemic. Thought I graduated from a school with educated people running it. Instead::: it looks like TSU administrators are a bunch of inbred hillbillies. Maybe your current students should look elsewhere...,#TXSTrespect means asking your students firsthand how they feel about the reopening plans for the fall. #TXSTrespect means giving merit to your students::: and asking for input. Fall registration numbers reflect when registration opened- before we shut down for COVID in the spring- and are not representative of the number of students who cannot or are uncomfortable with holding classes in-person. #TXSTrespect is laughable because students have been shown no respect by administration.,Respect means offering all classes online::: especially this summer. Disappointed alumni here.,I just want my classes online without being charged an extra fee over something I cannot control.,I'm so sick of your socialist BS. I don't think you know the definition of respect.,Bunch of brainwashed sheep::: not a surprise::: The head of the political science department was a joke,TXST respect means not bringing students back in a high risk situation just to justify the inordinate cost of college tuition....

That would be very respectful to me. Thank you,Hayden Jaco FAMOUS,TXST lost my respect several weeks ago over their decisions.,It’s not a new reality. Texas state has become a joke.

"The safety::: health & wellbeing of all Bobcats is our top priority during these unprecedented times. As a result::: experts on campus have worked together to develop the Roadmap to Return. This guideline charts our path for keeping our community safe & students successful. For summer II & fall 2020::: students & families can expect:

- Face coverings will be REQUIRED indoors & outdoors on TXST campuses unless the individual is alone.
- While many summer II courses & fall 2020 courses will be held face-to-face::: we are expanding our offerings of online::: remote or hybrid format courses.
- Social distancing measures will be implemented in classrooms & public spaces.
- Students will have increased access to more spaces with reliable computers & internet services to aid them in their education goals.

Families & Bobcat community members can learn more about the Roadmap to Return here: https://bit.ly/3g04j9X",6/25/2020 22:17,"I have sent an email to the university asking about the number of course offerings for the basic Accounting courses::: specifically. Other majors besides Accounting majors are required to take basic accounting. Yet::: in the fall::: only one course (which is listed as an honors course) was offered on Tuesday/
Thursday. The other classes were on MWF. All together::: these classes only enrolled about 550 students which makes it difficult for many students to get into these. It states above in the Roadmap: ""While many summer II courses & fall 2020 courses will be held face-to-face::: we are expanding our offerings of online::: remote or hybrid format courses."" This doesn't appear to be the case for the accounting classes::: or any of the other courses I have looked up.",Any idea how to get graduation announcements for the August grads? I know there’s no commencement ceremony but I would still like to send announcements out. I remember buying my older daughters thru the Bookstore there.,Online classes only::: your putting our children at risk! And were paying you to do it! Especially the summer II session. You got to do better then this. Very very disappointed in Tx State! DO BETTER! 😡,I think instead of having professors fight for online classes::: they should fight for in person classes. They should have to give good reason such as this class will not work online because it’s a lab class::: active class::: or whatever else. There are many class sessions for the same course and a majority of them should be online instead of one or none of them are. I’m taking four classes in the fall and NONE are offered online. I’m not taking any in summer two for the same reason.,Please call off in person classes. If the governor wouldn’t have opened so soon::: it might have worked. This is ridiculous.,Summer II classes are definitely NOT ready to be face-to-face::: Covid cases in San Marcos are spreading like wild fire right now. How don’t y’all see this?,if TXST cared about student safety::: health::: and well being they would still be providing remote learning to continue education and not reopening summer II and fall semester !!! Texas and especially Hayes county that TXST falls under had RECORD numbers in positive cases.,Why is my son being charged an additional $150 for a chemistry class to go online? We’ve already paid $3000 including athletic fees with no athletic events taking place not to mention other fees that he does not have access to for summer 2!,Actively sending students to campus and to the dorms when online classes should and can be held instead is dangerous and inconsiderate to students and their family members. Hopefully the local hospitals can handle the surge. Going to school shouldn’t come with a very real threat of going to the hospital in order to get a few credits on a transcript. Be better Texas State.,"What accommodations are you making for students who are immunocompromis
ed::: or live with loved ones who are immunocompromis
ed? Many of your students with disabilities may be at higher risk of fatal complications if they contract COVID while on campus due to preexisting conditions::: and unless all classes come with an online option::: this already disadvantaged demographic of your student body will have to choose saving their life over staying on track to graduate on time. Statistically::: students with disabilities already have a lower likelihood of graduating on schedule compared to their able bodied cohorts::: so I hope that Texas State is working towards expanding their accommodations within their required classes for their degree plan.",Idiots run Texas State. Money > safety::: am I right::: Trauth?,"Yeah::: let’s open up face to face classes when Texas is becoming the new epicenter of the pandemic... makes total sense!

If I were still a student at txst I’d be very disappointed. I think we all know a covid outbreak on campus is bound to happen if things are opened::: which will lead to more chaos for the school. They will regret this big time. Sorry::: Bobcats::: I feel for you 😢",So you can have face to face classes but still no type of graduation for the class of 2020??,I am very concerned. My daughter has already tested positive. Because of so much misinformation and so many faces to this virus could she get worse? Or potentially spread it even after they've given her the you're recovered story? Would they consider postponing?,It didn't have to be this way. If covid has caused you an inconvenience please make sure you VOTE in November. We deserve better than this.,Wasn’t “health and safety” the reason graduations were cancelled during the same time frame? But we get it... one is a monetary loss and the other ensures state funding for students in seats. Aside from the blatant lie::: y’all should really consider what you are asking students to do here with numbers on the rise. Stick to “health and safety” and cancel it all. I think the phrase “Don’t pee on my back and tell me it’s raining” applies perfectly here.,You can also start requiring departments to report if they’ve had a confirmed positive case not only for the safety of the students::: but for the employees and their families as well.,Coming back to campus in full in the fall is a mistake. I'm enrolled but only because I have to keep this degree moving. If you think you can police masks and clean enough you are mistaken. You can't even stop vaping and smoking in the quad on a normal day.,"Please make fall online !!!!!!!!!!! They say covid 19 will be back with a vengeance in the fall ! Please please don’t make the students go face to face ! Multiple students will
Be positive for covid and their education slowed due to this !!!! It is inevitable !!!!! Please please please shift all courses to online for summer 2 and fall 2020 ! Relook at it for spring ! This is crazy when right now Hays and comal
County have major spikes in covid cases and NB is a hot spot !!!!!!!!!!!! Please ! Who do we need to call to make this not happen face to face in the fall !!",Press on with your selfish desires::: TX State University board. The streets shall speak for themselves in retaliation. Not a single supportive comment on this thread.,Maybe allow the people that went to be in class go to class and the people that want to learn from home do distance learning. You’re planning on only doing 50% in class anyway. Let students decide.,I was supposed to be studying abroad in Scotland this fall and that university has already announced that classes will be 100% online this fall and campus will be open only on a high-need basis::: and cancelled my study abroad trip. What protections are in place here for students who cannot attend classes due to caring for family members or being ill themselves? What about students who only have access to internet at a certain time or one device? How will you ensure that all students are able to safely access their classes at all times? You’ve got to be way more specific and way more safe than this.,Texas State. Get on board. No one else is offering face to face classes in Texas this summer.,"Continuing classes on campus would definitely put a lot of people’s health in jeopardy. Given that many people’s health is on a wide spectrum::: there’s no one way to assure the practices the university intends to implement are 100% effective. It’ll most likely be ineffective. Online will be more beneficial for all students from the comforts of their own home/
environment.",I will be coming here this fall as a incoming freshman. This seems so overwhelming. Why would we have to pay a fee for a online class if your getting the same education as a in person class ?,What the heck does outside “alone” mean??? That makes absolutely zero sense. Do you mean that a student who isn’t walking with any other friends doesn’t need their mask on outside??? Or do you mean if the student is the only person on campus::: which would be never?,I haven’t seen a single student okay with face-to-face classes. Why not listen to well over the majority of students who want classes online?? How do we social distance in 200 person lecture halls? In elevators? On the bus?,"Dont send your kiddo if you do not want to
Others do and want face to face. Make other arrangements and stop ruining it for those that are ready for school",Parents have underlined conditions not safe face to face classes! Need on line period,"What will be the protocol for when a student tests positive for covid-19?
Will they be forced to self-quarantine
for 14 days?
What happens if they live in a dorm?
Will they need to be sent home?
Will all of the students and teachers that they came in contact with need to self-quarantine
?
Will students be wearing masks in the dormitories? In the dormitory bathrooms? In the dining halls?
Will tuition be refunded if a student becomes so ill that they are unable to attend class for several weeks?

This information NEEDS TO BE PUBLICIZED.
IT IS THE RIGHT of every student and parent to understand what the course of action will be when the virus begins to spread on campus.",Anything that can be online should be online period. Mandate it for all classes that do not involve hands on learning and keep Bobcats safe.,Hey Texas State! It would be great if y’all just put all classes online like many universities are doing. All of my classes are still on campus this fall. And many of my classes have 90+ people in them. I took genetics last semester and there were over 250 students packed in that room with no spare seats. How are student going to be able to social distance there? That class is STILL ON CAMPUS,Covid is not going away(just like the flu). I have a feeling right before classes start they are going to say everything will be on line in order to get housing and class $$.,Opening face-to-face for Summer II was always madness. Now::: it's criminal. Dr Trauth is compelling me to put my daughter::: a cancer survivor::: on an airplane next week::: to send her into the cauldron of a pandemic::: her life at risk again. If I don't::: her professional teaching career will be delayed fully a year::: and our relationship in jeopardy. An adult::: it's her choice. A choice no person should be forced to make. Please::: hit pause::: call it off.,"I’m so sad ... I know administration is trying to make very difficult decisions (we are trying to do the same for our public school students) and there is no good solution! Starting school face to face could potentially be a medical disaster. But I have 3 incoming Freshmen (1 at TxState) - starting college out online could potentially be an educational disaster. I’m trying to wrap my mind around how a Bio major gets what they need for postgraduate studies with online labs and classes. Foundational skills and understanding will be missed w/o discussion::: group exploration::: and that 1:1 interaction.
It’s just so disheartening.",Please keep classes in person. Some students rely on this for their sanity and mental health.,Maybe start by making online class prices equal to face-to-face. 🤷,Please have a graduation ceremony for May 2020 graduates!,Only one of my classes converted to online... now if the rest could that would be great.,Wow! There are so many cases in San Marcos.. why would you even offer face-to-face 🤦🏽‍♀️,The 'roadmap to disaster'. This will not end well. The writing is on the wall.,What about a road map to summer graduation. If they can be on campus::: with face masks::: social distancing::: etc....SURELY you can figure out graduation. This is the WORST. Texas State! Shame on YOU!,This decision is so bad. Here go more cases in San Marcos,Come on now. Just do online or give the students the options. Too soon txst especially for all of us that commute.,With the large class sizes::: I hope they open more courses::: because students will need to be spread out. I just don’t see that happening if class sizes are over 100.,"So there is no roadmap except to wear masks and social distancing...if
you couldn't have face to face classes in March-May::: how can you have them now when we are at our highest infection rate yet?",What does the fall look like for students going into their teaching block/ student teaching coursework?,If you truly cared about our health and well-being::: all classes would be online 🤦🏽‍♀️,Elizabeth Sizemore can you imagine social distancing in classrooms in the FCS? I’d also surely die walking up the Alkek steps in a mask.,Please let May graduates walk in December. We’ve worked so hard and we deserve to walk across the stage::: even if it means we have to wait it out.,I signed up for all online classes for the fall. Gonna miss the stairs...😜😜,We all have choices. No one is being forced to do anything.,I spoke with a lady in the president’s office last week. She told me they would be sending graduation information out to the seniors today and posting the information today. I guess they are not going to as I don’t see anything about it on the page.,But it isn’t. Your top priority is not our safety.,"Online format is ok for 1 or 2 courses at a time but I feel sorry for students trying to take a full load. It really isn't the same.
OTOH::: what if there's an outbreak on an entire floor of a dormitory??
This is a very difficult situation with no easy answers. 😔",Make it online ! Getting close to considering dropping if it stays face to face.,Have there been changes to use of the GI bill benefits for online classes?,Do your classes on line or you will not have any professor's teaching.,Cannot find anything on the website but is Texas State waiving ACT/SAT scores for ‘21?,There should be enough classes available online that if someone feels uncomfortable with coming to class face to face theyre still able to attend. This forces so many students into face to face classes that are unsafe and irresponsible.,How many staff members already have the covid on campus?? Did you have a death also?,Great job moving forward. Thanks for all you do.,At least provide sanitizer and disinfectant for every student or spray them when they come in or out,How about more hand sanitizer stations?,I agree Erin.

I'd pass out!,"Um::: TXST::: do you know how packed the buses are when there are three on a route?

Go Bobcats!,Should go online only!!!!!!!,"Where is Texas State’s concern for students living with others who are immunocompromis
ed? I tried to get my fall courses modified::: but since I’m not the one who’s more at risk::: then it’s somehow okay for me to go put myself on campus with a bunch of people from all over the country::: then bring COVID home to my family?! Plus::: might I add::: a community that will 100% be divided by those taking this seriously and those that don’t care at all. THIS WILL SPREAD. Please truly think about this scenario long and hard before forcing students to put themselves and their loved ones in danger::: when that situation could easily be prevented. If classes are going to go to 50% capacity anyway::: why not let the students that don’t want to go to campus do that? Where’s the harm???",I'm a marginalized group so I won't be adhering to these guidelines.,If you put the classes online ima be sad. How else am I supposed to pick up girls!!!,What if someone walks by and brushes you::: oh that never happens.😷,"If you go through these comments::: you can see what an impossible situation Texas State is in. Half are saying ""if you go all online::: I'm dropping:::"" and the other half is saying ""if you make me come to campus::: I'm dropping."" The University is trying to figure out how preserve enrollment while keeping students as safe as possible. You all are angry::: I get it. How about you do something::: and pick up the phone and call your state representatives
::: who are part of a legislature that has continually slashed the budgets of state institutions of higher ed every year since the 08-09 financial crisis. The university has already had to cut the management and operations budgets of every department 50% since this pandemic started::: then they had to go back and cut an additional 10% from every department's overall budget. Now::: the state is informing all agencies that they will be taking an ADDITIONAL 5-10% over the next three years. This isn't President Trauth's fault. It is the lack of priority we place on higher education. Call your state representative:::
and demand that they start responsibly funding the institutions that educate their populace. Then the university may be able to afford a potential 20% drop in enrollment::: which would be CATASTROPHIC to the University.","The safety and well being of students and faculty was blatantly disregarded when administration neglected to collect data from faculty and students on whether they are able or willing to return to in person instruction in the fall. Administration is neglecting student input::: and putting bobcat lives at risk without anything more than ""thoughts and prayers"".

Any updates on the Coach Kaspar investigation?",As a member of the most persecuted group in American history::: I find it utterly distasteful that Texas State would support such a blatantly racist cause.,Of course white people would be offended by the fist 😂 bunch of KARENS!!!!!,The city has to start from where it is. Firing the police chief will delay substantive action until a paragon of law enforcement who satisfies everyone is found::: following weeks of public hearings guaranteeing that everyone gets to put the their 2 cents in. The chief will no doubt be chosen for his or her ability to walk on water. After this selection process::: the new chief must listen to everyone::: learn about the challenges::: get to know the city::: and practice his or her water walking abilities. Finally::: then::: actions will be taken that will never please everyone::: after which the whole process will begin again.,A clenched fist isn’t diversity.

697 Since I don't see anyone posting the actual allegation. The people his words effected have spoken out. Do you think he gave them a ""final warning"" before choosing to spew racially charged comments at them? I doubt it. Texas State has taken a very clear stand::: that Black Lives Matter. As an alumni I am very proud of that. If Kaspar continues to be employed by the school it would be a direct contradiction to that very statement.",While I wish he hadn't said things like that::: I believe that those comments were most likely made to push the students and without malice. Having spoken with both him and his wife (who helps a ton with the team)::: that team is everything to them. They care about their players both on and off the court.

"Dear Students::: Faculty::: and Staff:::

It is difficult to find the words to share this news with you. Today::: I learned that one of our students::: Justin Howell::: was critically injured in a protest in Austin on Sunday::: May 31.

What was already a heartbreaking situation has hit painfully close to home. We are thinking of Justin’s family::: friends::: and classmates during this time and hope for his full recovery and healing.

We are in the middle of a national emergency centuries in the making::: and people are crying out to be heard. The headlines::: the videos::: and the experiences of our community are overwhelming to watch::: and now one of our own in the Texas State family has been gravely hurt.

Black Lives Matter. It is not debatable at Texas State. Justin Howell’s life matters. Black lives matter in our classrooms::: on our campuses::: and in the streets during tumultuous protests. They matter every moment of every day::: no exceptions::: no debate. I am committed to the struggle for their dignity::: humanity::: rights::: voice::: and safety.

Sincerely:::

Denise M. Trauth
President",6/3/2020 23:06,"It is also a communist organization. And it is anti-Christian.
So bull hockey on supporting them. I believe All Lives Matter!",Will take the Statue of LBJ down that will help if that was removed off campus.,And yet you've got a statue of LBJ on your campus. Either BLM::: or they don't::: can't be both. Johnson must fall....,Hey::: remember when multiple staff/faculty members have been reported for racism::: and you and your administration pushed it under the rug? Good times::: good times. This post is lackluster considering you don’t hold people accountable for their actions.,How is Justin doing now? I’m a mother of six and grandmother of six. Two of my six children are black twins we took in as foster kids when they were 3 and adopted when they were 5. They are going to be 29 in August. I pray every day that they keep their heads down and do the right thing. Can you just picture a white mother in TV after her black son is killed? The will hear me yelling three states away! I am praying for mightily Justin; I hope he recovers very quickly!! Please keep me informed...❤️❤️😷😷😷,"Most of the human species want to be equals and treated equally. But by using the word ""black"" we have immediately seperated the human species into race. The death of Mr Floyd needs focus on police procedures::: punishment of police::: and reform. Instead the main focus has been on the mistreatment of people with dark skin.",did you mean - how are we going to defund the police and reallocate those funds to communities of color? I thought that was the thing people are debating::: right?,If you believe in God ALL lives matter. As to your student it is sad he is hurt but he is an adult and made a choice. He knew the consequences,"Texas State President::: you may say it is not debatable at Texas State. However::: your Greek life communities are on-campus representations
of systemic racism. How have we not addressed this? What will you do moving forward to ensure that students cannot isolate themselves from a racially diverse student body in communities made up primarily of white people? Where is the link to resources for ways that students can help? Do you not have any? PM me and I’ll send you some. What will YOU be doing moving forward to commit our university to battling racial injustice on our campus and in our nation?",Pres Trauth::: it is tantamount that you and other high level movers and shakers create a forum for discussion and eventual change. We support efforts in making real changes to support and protect our students. We look to you for leadership. '84,Agenda 21...take control of all education::: seminaries::: and colleges. Repent! The kingdom of God is at hand.,"I feel for the cause and I feel for the student. But the words ""not debatable"" should never be said::: especially at an institution of higher learning.",Great to hear but hard to believe Trauth is actually with it after her response to Rudy Martinez’s article in 2018..,Sorry if this already has been asked or posted. Is there a gofundme administered by Justin Howell’s family to donate to?,"I guess its a lot easier to address these issues when they literally aren't occouring on your campus::: because when they are... I just hope this isn't a dogwhistling attempt at ""Black owned business"" signing your campus's physical propety to saftey from percieved 'looters' Eat em up!",ALL lives Matter. And likewise should not be debatable at Texas State,Straight like that! I'm so proud to have graduated from this wonderful university!,"What is the Texas State community doing to have a presence at the city council meeting tomorrow at 3pm in Austin Texas?

It means the world.,"I was so worried that I had made the wrong decision to fulfill my dream of being a Bobcat when it came to this matter!
I couldn't be any more proud to see that I didn't after all. ✊🏼✊🏼✊🏼
Thank you Texas State for standing up for what is right.","It literally takes a student being severely injured in order for you to say that Black Lives Matter::: and yet you’ve ignored all the racism on your campus for years. You’ve let hate groups on to this campus::: your campus police have profiled students and arrested them without just cause::: and you have had racist students within your student government. Not to mention the lack of full time POC staff members.
If you’re preaching that Black Lives Matter::: you need to actually prove it. Improve your campus.",Since when are subjects not “debatable” in a university setting?,Can the Bobcat fund help him out? Is there a go fund me for his medical expenses? Can he get rehab at Texas State?,I wish I could believe this is how you truly felt. Having experienced first hand the racial injustices at your university dealt on my son where you took no action makes me pause.,PROUD TO BE A BOBCAT TODAY! Thank you for showing vulnerability and courage in leadership because it is only in times of discomfort do we grow better::: wiser::: and stronger leaders. They lead with connection to bring people together towards a community grounded in inclusion and equity. We simply need to pause::: reflect::: listen and push past the uncomfortable to build a stronger Bobcat family for current and future bobcats::: for each day that comes forth::: and every class we bring into our home. Eat’em up Cats!,Do the rest matter to you too? It's an odd statement. In my house LIVES matter. We don't distinguish between any color::: gender or age. I'm sad you do. All life is precious. No need to distinguish between any of them. Its tacky and wrong. But I'm not in style and cool like everyone else. I'm just some old lady. Division is sad.,"Thank you for this. I am so proud to be a bobcat! I hope that Justin recovers soon. #BlackLivesMatte

Prayers are with him::: his family and the Texas state family,Does anyone know will he manage with his hospital bills?,All pepple should matter. The fact is::: if you choose to go protest::: risk are usually involved. If you choose to risk your life::: thats on you. Yes::: sad to say::: buy many protest rallies escalate and violence takes place. Sometimes innocent people protesting in a peaceful manner are injured.

Lots of other footage out there to get to the truth. Hey there-Justin is one of the three victims of police brutality perpetrated by Austin Police Department when he was peacefully protesting outside their HQ. He was shot and suffered extreme head trauma injury and brain damage and will need expensive medical care for the rest of his life.

He is only 20 years old.
He is a fellow Texas State University student Texas State Alumni Association Bobcat and I hope my fellow Bobcats will considering helping this young student. He will probably never be able to finish his degree due to the extent of his injuries.

Protesting is one thing. Rioting and looting are unacceptable. All the damage caused by these Dumbasses have cost harf working people jobs and sometimes thier businesses. Because damaged caused by looting and riots are not usually covered by insurance.

Then your life doesnt matter to me anymore. And Im sure it doesnt matter to God anymore either!,"In 2019::: police shot and killed 9 unarmed blacks::: and 19 unarmed whites. In Chicago alone over Memorial Day weekend::: blacks were killing blacks::: 10 as a matter of fact. So in too many communities across the country::: black lives didn't matter to other blacks. In abortion clinics across the country::: those lives killed off didn't matter. You see::: I will believe we as a country care about other lives when their own life::: and their views truly reflect that ALL lives matter to God. The Christian edict of love God and love your neighbor as yourself is simple::: yet near impossible for most people to do 100%.

Emotional outbursts without any reality check is wrong. Police killing 9 unarmed blacks and 19 unarmed whites is about 28 too many in 2019::: but what percentage is that over an entire year. The numbers don't add up to systemic racism by cops in terms of killing people::: but now cities are overrun by riots and looters that are also killing people::: then want to claim certain lives matter.

"A message from the President:

Dear Members of the Bobcat family:::

I have watched with great sadness the situation in Minneapolis related to the death of George Floyd. I grieve for his family::: friends::: and community. While I may never know the personal fear this brings to many of you::: I am enraged with you. And::: I am all the more committed to making Texas State University a place where you can find healing and solace.

In times like this – when our nation’s attention is turned to the destructive toll racism takes in our communities – we are reminded of how critical it is that we remain steadfast in our commitment to advancing a Texas State culture of equity and inclusion.

I hope we all pause::: reflect::: and consider the impact of these events on our Bobcat family and those members hit hardest by this tragedy. Please know that we are here for you and our hearts are with everyone hurting in Minneapolis::: nationwide::: and here at home.

Sincerely:::

It’s sooo hard to believe your words because you waged a war against and tried to run off or sequester every Black staff/ faculty member who asserted their support in speaking out against the racist incidents that repeatedly happened on that campus. They were vehemently punished. Your history work speaks a volume so hire black and Browns faculty members NOW if you are for BLM.

I also find it an ironic statement considering how your institution covered up the number of sexual assaults there::: hiding the true number. Hmmmmm?,"This is NOT a Texas State problem...
Not everyone or every business needs to make a statement to push the schools view onto students.

I pay for my young adult to go to school to learn::: challenge::: and use voice of opinion to be ready for the world. Not some hypocrites with agenda to force issues on the students.

If you really want to make a statement that matters.

What about the effect of mental disorders on the young people and the numbers of suicides and suicides attempt since the chinavirus have increased.
Domestic violence has raised.

That just a start.

Not because the media and story of day is this.
I do feel bad for the Floyd family and pray for his family",Way to fuel the fire and be apart of the problem. WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?,You disgust me. You representing my school is an absolute embarrassment. I am ashamed and appalled that you somehow continue to hold the position that you do::: continually perpetuating race to further your own agenda when you hold a position that should be nothing but equal. You know nothing of equality. You do not represent my school.,Better cancel those summer classes for health and safety reasons like graduation. Or you could just put out a statement and do nearly nothing like every other racial issue that has come up on this campus the last 5 years.,How about you condemn the pieces of trash that are terrorizing our cities right now. For no reason.,At least she is saying something that’s a lot more than the Pres of the United States has done.,A change to give our graduates their graduation ceremony is what you should be considering changing. They work hard and have earn it.,A change to give our graduates their graduation ceremony is what you should be considering changing. They work hard and have earn it.,A change to give our graduates their graduation ceremony is what you should be considering changing. They work hard and have earn it.,I attended Southwest Texas State University (Texas State University) from 1976-1980::: finish with a B. S. in Education. This university had a very serious problem with race relations. Some of the students have never dealt with a black student::: or one who was his/her roommate. I say the University had come along way in the past but let hope the future is better.,Where is your heartfelt sadness for the students of all colors that spent thousands & thousands of dollars over the past few years earning a degree that they won't even get a graduation for? Couldn't even give them their framed diploma for free as some sort of good gesture. Still had to pay $250 for it. People are tired of statements. They accomplish nothing. Take action & be the change.,I was just sitting here wondering what the university position was on this except not at all.,That’s cute. You pandering institution of corruption,Open your purse,Trauth is a capitulating coward and everyone knows it,All lives matter!!! justice and fairness equality for all lives!!!,Didn't you call STATE POLICE on student protesters?,How many football games are we going to win this year?,With as many issues that have repeatedly popped up with white supremacy groups on campus in the last decade under your watch::: I don't really have faith in your words right now.,Please explain how it is racism? It’s racism because the media said it’s racism. It’s a bad individual who happens to be a cop. It doesn’t make looting and destroying buildings right regardless what you want to call it,As a mother of a student that graduated from TXST::: I’m am absolutely appalled at the racism my daughter experienced while enrolled and living in that community. She has been fearful for her own life and it continues to haunt her to this day! How many of you::: at 19 years of age and first moving away from home:::have been asked to step out of your car when pulled over with back up called for nothing? No ticket for a traffic violation and no other suspicions. Just to ask where you are going and why? The lights lit up behind the officers so you can’t see the officers’ faces? Not knowing what is about to happen?? How many of you were peacefully walking in protest and watch your friend being arrested for doing nothing but his skin is the wrong color? How many of you have come home to find a rebel flag laying over your bed? She continued working and focusing on her degree with courage and faith. Allowing things like this on your campus is completely unnerving for a parent. You should always take into consideration the other side. I am white and I am ashamed of this behavior!,Trauth racism has been a severe problem under your tenure.,Why does she need to make a statement? Serious question.,Why is she even commenting? Just a guess here::: but I’m sure there are more things on your plate that you should be handling. If you want to make a difference in the University and the lives of the students::: actions speak louder than some hollow PC statement::: that was released because making statements of support on condemnation on issues is now the expected for anyone and everyone. Here’s an idea::: put your head down and get to work.,A change to give our graduates their graduation ceremony is what you should be considering changing. They work hard and have earn it.,Our Liberal President is the problem for this racism. You can’t protect our students with your liberal beliefs! You have destroyed our university. You must leave or retire!! SOUTHWEST TEXAS STATE UNIVERSITY,"Maybe your creative writing class can remind us white folks::: that our DNA is a abomination....
.",She always comments on things like this but never actually takes action. I am still waiting for every person involved in racist events that take place on campus to be penalized. People get penalized when they are a minority::: otherwise they claim “they will look into it” and never actually do anything about it::: they never find the person who did it. Txst is full of racism and the student body and professors know it. They claim to be inclusive::: I’ve never heard the word “inclusive” as many times as I did when I attended orientation. All of that is BS and they know it.,Thank you for posting this President Trauth.,Not sure why Trauth thinks she’s someone special that needs to make a comment on this. Stick to education,I'm gonna be honest::: stuff like this coming from you is pretty hollow. It was also under your tenure that conservative student groups were being attacked and the student newspaper was turned into an anti conservative bully pulpit. I graduated from there in 1995 and have stopped giving the University money. Until true respect::: rule of law and the bullying stops. Freedom of speech is for all not all who agree with you..,"#BlackLivesMatte

You are putting your students::: staff::: and residents of San Marcos at risk. Online instruction has worked fine so far. What is the push to return to face to face::: when you were fine canceling graduation? I suspect this has more to do with budget and less to do with safety.

A Message from your Faculty",5/16/2020 17:52,JUST SAY NO TO BETO OROURKE !!!!,I called the school today::: no one can seem to give me an answer on what day and time my daughters virtual graduation will be. The lady at the Presidents Office said she will get back with me. This is so frustrating! At the very least they need to let us know something! No updates::: no communication.,My daughter got her diploma in the mail yesterday... she had top honors::: and not even a note to go with it.😒,"As a proud Bobcat parent it makes me very disheartened to say that I am NOT at all proud of TXST for deciding NOT to honor your graduates with a ceremony!
My daughter has given 5 hard years of her life to you and is now feeling deflated and heartbroken by your decision.
As a child who was raised without a father::: she was fortunate to have a very loving and supportive Grandfather in her life. There was nothing he wanted more than to see his granddaughter walk the stage as a college graduate. Unfortunately her Grandfather succomed to Stage 4 brain::: lung and bone cancer this last September. She struggled to continue with school through this loss but always said she was determined to walk the stage with ""I did it Grandpa"" bedazzled on her cap to honor him::: knowing that he would be so very proud of her. That thought kept her hanging on to get through her last semesters.
Now you've made a decision to NOT allow her this and it is beyond sad to hear her speak of a university she was so proud to be a part of like it was just another thing in her life that let her down.
Local Texas high schools and our governor have decided to resume in person classes this August::: yet you can't seem to reverse your decision to allow your graduates to walk that stage so that their families can celebrate this huge honor with them. I honestly think it's disgusting that you have no problem taking our money for five years but can't take a few hours out of your time to honor our children!
I know I am not alone in my thoughts as I signed a petition that was circulated by one of your students that had already gained over 8000 signatures by the time I signed it.
There are hundreds of ways you could alter the ceremonies to aid in social distancing measures::: ways in which I'm sure most people would be more than willing to deal with. Since our governor has lifted restrictions::: why not leave it up to the decision of the families as to whether or not they choose to attend? After all the hard work these students have put in to earn their degrees::: I would hope that you're not just being lazy by not wanting to make the effort to alter ceremonies in order to allow them to take place.
Come on Texas State University... do the RIGHT thing and reinstate graduation ceremonies that were due to take place this fall","kutubiyglobalse

"A message from the President:

Dear Bobcats:::

When the decision was made to move classes to remote delivery after spring break to protect our Texas State University community from the spread of the coronavirus::: we also decided to postpone spring commencement to August 6 and 8::: 2020::: to coincide with August 7::: 2020::: summer ceremonies.

The commencement feasibility work group::: which included student representatives::: faculty senators::: a dean representative::: the registrar::: the commencement coordinator::: the associate vice president for academic affairs::: and the chief medical officer::: has searched for the safest options to hold commencement events for more than 6:::000 graduates and their families and friends over three days of ceremonies. After exhausting every possible scenario::: we have made the hard decision that it will not be possible to hold in-person commencement ceremonies in August 2020 for spring and summer graduates while adhering to the required social distancing measures. Instead::: we will share virtual commencement ceremonies on August 6::: 7::: and 8::: 2020.

As President::: Commencement is my favorite time of year. Like many of you::: I am disappointed that we cannot come together in person to celebrate this special occasion. However::: I take comfort in knowing that we are doing the right thing to protect our Bobcat family and the greater San Marcos community.

I know this may feel like a diminished experience::: but by no means does it lessen the accomplishments of our graduates. Commencement is important because it is the ceremony to celebrate and formally recognize the degrees you have earned as graduates of Texas State University. No matter what form commencement takes::: those degrees are yours now::: and for the rest of your lives.

Planning is underway to ensure we have a very special experience to honor our graduates during a virtual commencement. We want to honor our brave students who persevered and graduated despite the disruption caused by the pandemic.

To our graduates::: I offer you a sincere and heartfelt congratulations. Your dedication and tenacity have shown the world what it means to be a Bobcat.

Sincerely:::

Denise M. Trauth
President",5/11/2020 22:21,I am highly disappointed in Texas State.... myself along with other students have dedicated time ::: hard work and money towards our schooling and this is how our semester will end? No thank you::: We all expected better than this. Yet y’all are allowing hundreds of students even Incoming FRESHMEN to attend class and thousands of students to walk around campus. Ofcoarse::: the school enforced this just so it can receive tuition from students..... smh. The fact that this school fails to at least make special arrangements is sooo disappointing. There could have been limitations in guests (2-4 people ) per graduate along with social distancing seating across the football stadium or basketball arena. Everyone attending could have also been required to wear masks and hand sanitizer. All us have had a tough semester and we will leave Texas state with no special recognition ..... wow. Throughout our four years we have waited for this day and now it has been taken from us and our parents::: so easily like it means nothing. Myself along with other graduates will remember this::: what a shame 😔😭,"I received the email 10 minutes before my LAST and FINAL presentation at Texas State::: and had to hold back tears during. Disappointed to say the least.

I’ll be jumping in Sewell this weekend to celebrate!! Hopefully I’ll see other fellow graduates.","As an alum::: I'm really disappointed that this is how little effort you've taken to take care of these students. You certainly took their money and they'll be in debt for decades::: but you can't go the extra mile to provide them with an opportunity to walk the stage?

Preposterous. There are dozens of safe ways that you could make this happen by simply splitting majors up a little differently and doing the ceremonies outside in smaller groups throughout the summer and into the fall.

Not as proud as I usually am to be a Bobcat today. My peers deserve better.",This announcement could have been made at the conclusion of finals. Making this announcement while students aren’t even finished with the spring semester is distracting and shows tremendous lack of empathy,"So disappointed and heartbroken for these students who have work so hard and looked forward to being able to walk across the stage and receive their diploma. Large high schools are able to accommodate a live ceremony::: but Texas State can’t? These students deserve this and should be allowed to experience it.
Summer 2 classes are still being held on campus????? But graduation ceremonies can’ t happen for safety reasons.....ple
ase explain.
And two weeks later the campus is resuming the fall semester as normal???
How is a graduation ceremony endangering everyone::: but face to face classes and everything will return to normal two weeks after the scheduled graduation. I am sorry::: this makes no sense and these deserving students are being robbed of a ceremony they have worked so hard for. They deserve the recognition!",President Trauth::: you’ve made some questionable decisions for this university during my time here but this one is by far the most disappointing of all.,A hard pill to swallow::: but we accept it. We are very sad for our Texas State graduate 👨‍🎓::: but understand that the safety and well-being of others is more important.,"Although I do see the big picture::: I do believe this decision was made too soon.

How is TXST going to have Summer II in person?! Why can’t you spread out the graduations by colleges within a week or two week span??

As a first generation college graduate getting a Master’s degree::: quite frankly I don’t care what day of the week I’d walk as long as I get to walk. I’ve spent too much money::: time::: and effort into this degree and this moment to not get to do it.

Please reconsider.","This is truly heartbreaking..
we have our 3rd child graduating from Texas State..our other two graduate from Texas State and would like for our last one to also cross the stage..she has worked so hard the last 2 years making the Dean's list maintainly her grades thru all this mess..We have 3 months and you make this decision too soon..Let's not give up on these students make other arrangements...
use the football stadium even if it placed on several days to graduate these students!! They deserve to have a proper graduation ceremony..other
colleges have found a way to have outdoor ceremonies..Ple
ase reconsider your decisions!!!",I’m pretty sure the only ones saying this is a good idea are Those that have no kiddo graduating so this means nothing to them and .. they have NO IDEA how the students and family are feeling .. I really do hope Texas State changes their virtual idea and uses their huge outdoor stadium..,We have already gone through so much this semester and now this too! We have dreamed of this day for years::: just for it to get ripped away from us. I am so disappointed about this announcement and think this decision was made way to early!!Texas State please reconsider this decision!!!!,"Let’s focus on the positives here. Graduates worked hard to achieve a goal. Congratulations
to all graduates!
And I appreciate how the President and Texas State is thinking of family members::: graduates::: school personnel::: and the community. It wasn’t an easy decision. Keep the focus on the graduates no matter how their ceremony is conducted. They achieved a degree::: something no one can ever take away. I wish them all the best in their future endeavors.","I've been working on a master's for 5 years while working full time. I've had the conferences I was supposed to present my research at cancelled::: and now my graduation. And guess what? I applaud TXST for this decision. People are dying at higher and faster rates than before and the number will only go up if we continue have these gatherings. The celebration of my accomplishments
is NOT worth someone's life. I am proud of what I've done and so are my parents. That is what is important.","Very disappointing!!
! These graduates and their families deserve better than a Zoom ceremony. I hope this decision is reconsidered.",Great decision::: Texas State! People will criticize any decision made. You’re looking out for the best of all people. I commend you for this! ♥️,"2020 Graduates::: you have a bright future ahead of you! Congratulations
on a wonderful accomplishment.
While your ceremony will be different::: it says something about you as a class... YOU ARE DIFFERENT. You will be the class to be in all the history books. Embrace this as an opportunity to celebrate a different STYLE of graduation and make it your own. You deserve the very best and we all celebrate you this year. Be proud::: Bobcats! You will succeed at everything you do. ❤",This is so disappointing. Our young adults have worked very hard to walk across that stage. I realize they have all succeeded in completing their college degrees but the icing on the cake is left off. This is a proud moment to share with family who have been there every step of the way for their graduates. This is beyond disappointing. Texas State::: you have let down so many students::: parents ::: and family. You should have graduation ceremony every day of the week to get it done!!! So proud of the class of 2020!!!!,The President of the University should be fired! To make this announcement during finals and to not have a plan is totally unacceptable. There should have been a plan in place after the announcement was made to postpone graduation to August for May Graduation. They have done nothing for these students and will not do anything for them but take their money and run. Other Texas Universities have done more during this pandemic and in other years without this situation.,Thank you for considering the community and the students. I know this is a difficult decision but thanks.,"Terrible decision::: I truly hope you reconsider.
Why have summer 2 in person ? 6000 people could of been done in 1-2 weeks::: do it at different locations ( indoor- outdoor)::: limit number of guests. So many options- due to the pandemic. Safety but giving our graduates their ceremony. It doesn’t have to be done in 3 days.
Very disappointing TXST","Yeah how about no. This b.s. needs to get fixed and fixed fast. This is the best option that the Administration’
s “best and brightest” could come up with? Get it together and figure out a solution. Completely unacceptable and disrespectful to all of these bobcats and their families.",Do you all really think this was an easy decision? I have a graduate and I’m in tears as I read this but I would in no way ridicule the leadership for an unprecedented decision they’re faced to make in the wake of all the angry parents. YOU go make a public health decision. Extremely sad::: heartbroken parent of a 2020 graduate that worked hard. 👩‍🎓,"Words can not express how ANGRY I am. In person commencement is possible - do it in smaller groups at the Football stadium and limit the number or guests. The ONLY other option would be virtual next weekend as originally scheduled.

This decision will not only affect graduates and their families::: but also local businesses. It will also significantly impact future donations. 2020 graduates will feel they were screwed by TxSt more than once.",I’ve been on the Dean’s List every semester since I’ve been at Texas State. I’ve put in hours of hard work and dedication just for my moment to walk across the stage as a graduate. I just don’t understand how this can be taken away from us::: we’ve all put in so much work to get to this point. Truly heartbreaking.,Just because the ceremony will not be happening anymore does not take away from the fact that the Spring 2020 graduates will be receiving their degrees. Why do many people feel as if their hard work would be for nothing if they don’t partake in the ceremony for the purpose of gratification? This is just my opinion. I too am a Spring 2020 graduate::: and although It would have been nice to partake in the ceremony::: it doesn’t devalue all the work I have done. I just feel bad for my family members because they were looking forward to seeing me walk. Nevertheless::: its not the end of the world. Cheers 🥂,Why are us May graduates having to wait until August? And how can you believe it is safe enough for Summer 2 classes? I hope you do make it incredibly special,This would be 600 or more ceremonies at 20 ceremonies per day at the 10 person limit. If anyone has any spectacular ideas on how to make this happen::: you should share. And why would you expose the same staff members to that many people 20 times per day for 30 days? Right now::: it’s the right decision.,Of course the experience is diminished. Texas A&M took out a full page ad in the Houston Chronicle (among others) honoring their Spring 2020 graduates. They also displayed the graduate's names on the big screen at Kyle Field. Class act! Texas State is cancelling an event 3 months before it is scheduled. Really? If it is virtual then honor the Spring graduates NOW!!!!,Worst decision every!!! If you can bring students back in August you have have a ceremony. So when will the graduates receive their diploma? When will they get to jump in the river with their peerS? Extremely disappointed in TXST. Let them walk!!!!,"I can’t believe you would do this to these students. They have worked so hard to get to this moment in their lives. They have paid your university thousands upon thousands of dollars for their education and you think a “virtual” graduation will somehow suffice? Do better. The class of 2020 deserves to have their accomplishments
recognized and celebrated. They deserve to walk that stage and jump in the river.",Wow...high schools are holding outdoor graduations and this university can’t? Very disappointed.,Heartbroken Parent. I understand being cautious. But we are going to make decisions three months out. These individual have worked so hard for this. I think you had time to wait and make the call later.,If my High school Senior son is having his Graduation in new Braunfels outdoors at their stadium then Texas state has the outdoor stadium to be able to do the the same .. I hope you all take that into consideration,Good decision. Better safe than sorry in this crazy time of a PANDEMIC. Anyone saying this is the wrong decision is clearly not seeing the bigger picture and/or is just deeply selfish. Congrats::: Grads!,If classes are being held in August and 39:::000 attend the school. But we can’t have graduation two weeks before that? I am so angry with Texas State!,Why are summer 2 classes still being held in person??,"This ""virtual"" business is a slap in the face to all those who worked their tails off to earn their degree and the honors bestowed to each graduate. With the state opening back up::: you would think that creative intellect that makes up the university's Board of Regents would somehow do better. But I guess not....so disappointing for the class of 2020 to have their hearts rip out. Thousands of dollars sent to Texas State University just be slapped in the face....what a shame! At least open up the park so the graduates can have the tradition of jumping in the river!",What is wrong with you TS staff??? You have huge facilities and a huge field. Even if it takes a month to hold in person commencements a little bit at a time and at the same time applying all safety precautions. You have received huge amounts of money from the graduating students and they deserve every solution possible. Reconsider your decision!!!!,Make sure those football games are canceled too! Let’s be fair. And the May graduates should at the VERY least had their day recognized with a virtual ceremony this WEEK. Texas State you have failed with this poor decision.,I am so disappointed you didn’t try hard enough Texas State University!!! You just gave up on these students! These kids have worked so hard and deserve to have a proper graduation ceremony. Other schools have found ways to have ceremonies outside. We have three months and you make this decision now! How do you expect to have students come two weeks later to start the fall semester?? Maybe they need to go elsewhere.,I think this is absolutely ridiculous to make this call right now. This was still 3 months out. And are summer 2 classes still being held in person during the SAME time frame????? Makes no sense whatsoever. Extremely disappointed in TXST. Honestly could care less about the virtual graduation.... Let’s WALK.,Why not hold graduation every night for a darn week if needed! This is so ridiculous and I’m extremely disappointed in TXST.,It would be nice if our online regalia orders hadn't been canceled. I had mine canceled and told I had to order at the bookstore in April. Now no graduation and not even my mortarboard and tassel. Can we at least get that??? No senior pictures::: no regalia::: no ceremony and it is finals week.,My heart is broken. I have dreamed of walking the stage since my first day at Texas State. I hope the virtual graduation turns out just as special.,At least wave their student loans. These students worked so hard and it’s not their fault graduation is cancelled.,"I’m so incredibly disappointed in this decision. This was still scheduled three months away. I’ve been in school for five years. I’ve put my blood::: sweat::: and many::: many tears into this school and you guys just ripped the one major thing I have been dreaming of::: from me.

We had THREE MONTHS TO GO until this ceremony. You couldn’t have waited two months to work this out. To give us some crappy alternative of a virtual ceremony. I’m not a high school student (although they deserve a ceremony as well)::: I have put THOUSANDS of dollars into this school and ya’ll just ripped one of the biggest things I’ve been looking forward to from myself and thousands of others.

Good job Texas State. You just exiled your students into being very upset with you.",Be bold::: have the in-person commencement ceremonies!,"My heart hurts for these graduates. They deserve SO MUCH MORE! 💔 CONGRATULATIONS
class of 2020! You will forever be in the history books... not only as a Bobcat Grad::: but the 1st virtual class! #eatemup Evey Shanks I love y'all ❤",Why can’t you do a virtual ceremony for the May graduates so they don’t have to wait and be lumped in with August!?,Not good enough. The ceremony is such an important part of the experience.,"Extremely disappointed! My daughter ordered her cap and gown back in March and her order was canceled because the May commencement ceremony was canceled. Now there will be no graduation pictures with cap and gown nothing to remember. I understand there will be no ceremony and too dangerous to do so. I don't mind purchasing a cap and gown for $30 so I can have a keepsake photos of my daughter wearing them. Please let the students purchase their caps and gowns if they want to. At least they could be photographed wearing their regalia. This would be a great keepsake for the parents to celebrate their accomplishments
. The school is not allowing the students to purchase their caps and gowns at all now. I wished my daughter bought her's back in January at least I could of had a keepsake photo of her now it's too late and will never be allowed to purchase them. $30 is nothing compared to all the money I have spent at this university.",This is extremely disappointing. You should AT LEAST do the virtual ceremony in May. What a crock.,"Horrible decision! Three months in advance?! “Virtual” is in no way honoring the graduates hard work. There are numerous strategies to hold smaller ceremonies in an enormous outdoor stadium::: perhaps by program. They deserve to physically walk the stage even if the physically-pres
ent audience is smaller.

High schools in Texas::: some who have over 1:::000 graduates::: are holding commencement ceremonies following certain activities guidelines.

If you can’t hold multiple smaller commencements in August::: how do you plan to open residence halls and lecture halls the same month?",This is not about safety or logistics::: it is about laziness. We try to teach our kids that there is a solution to every problem if you persevere and use your brain. What a horrible example to set as these kids start their lives as adults. This has been difficult enough for them::: let me say this::: you are not heroes in this pandemic and it is so disappointing.,Graduate student graduating here. Although it’s extremely disheartening to receive this news::: I understand. However::: if any large::: in person events such as football games::: 300+ lecture classes etc. are held even shortly after August then this decision is motivated by different reasons other than stated. You can expect as much backlash as possible by myself and possibly others. People have lost so much more than a graduation for true reasons::: if this is actually the reason(we shall see when August comes around). I accept this decision completely with no complaints if it’s fair with the above personally.,Would have been nice if you AT LEAST let them order and receive their cap and gowns instead of canceling all the orders! Could have at least celebrated at home with pics and family gatherings to try and make it as special as possible!,I think this a terrible decision by Texas State. The university is showing a lack of care for the students and everyone who loves the students. The university could have a better solution::: such as holding the ceremony outdoors and limiting guests. I would hope the university would reconsider and have a live graduation,Txst do better!!! Being a alumni this is so sad! This decision is being made 3 months out.... ridiculous! A virtual graduation is not the way to do this!! Consider doing it in the football stadium with more room to spread family’s out! FIND ANOTHER WAY! Let them walk they at least deserve that since they couldn’t finish in the class room with there classmates and professors!!,"Disgraceful that the university administration brains can't come up with a plan for these young men and women. Break it up into 10 or 20 groups if you have to::: but don't just dismiss the importance of the college graduation ceremony. Your official statement saying you have looked at all the options is simply a lame cop out. Shame on you for crushing these kids dreams with your ""at least you got a degree::: good luck"" statement.","To add::: I’m gonna be pissed if y’all cancel graduation almost 3 months out WHEN THERE ARE OPTIONS::: but still plan to hold any sporting events with crowds.
I know myself and many others who have worked hard for our graduation moment will do whatever we have to if it means we get to walk.",All this hard work seniors have put into graduating this year has been taken away from us. I get being cautious::: but why can’t we just have a rescheduled ceremony when it’s safe again? This was the year I and many other students have looked forward to only for it to be canceled. We just finished finals and get this? Too early. I ask that you please reconsider and reschedule our ceremony to a later and safer date.,lots of people apparently want to be the president at texas state.,All I’m saying is::: you better not ever ask me for money as an alumni if this is what you call caring about students.,Ridiculous!! Have it outdoors at the football field! So upset for my daughter who has worked so hard! Silly to make this decision this early!,All this money we've paid and all this hard work down the drain. This is how you treat these deserving individuals. You can hold it in the out door stadium many schools ate moving graduations to other locations so you HAVEN'T begun to exhaust any leads. You're clearly giving up. Why would you make them reorder caps and gowns 2 weeks ago to turn around and do this. You have 2 months still! Thank you for giving up on the class of 2020!,You made the correct decision::: President Trauth.... it's disappointing for everyone::: but throwing hissy fits about it is so immature... I'm disappointed about a situation that no one created::: and for which no one can be held responsible...,My heart is broken. I was truly looking forward to crossing that stage for so many reasons. I feel that the Class of 2020 should have this ceremony even if the date has to be changed again. We made it through so many years of late night studying::: sometimes not even sleeping::: working full time jobs::: and some of us also raising our families along the way. This experience should not be taken from us. Please give us a better option so that we can experience a true graduation 🎓.,Wondering if we'll get refunded for our announcements and regalia????,I am shocked at how many people think this ceremony is more important than public health! Thank you to our leadership for making such a tough decision::: knowing that it was not going to be a popular one.,"My number 1 concern about this announcement is TIMING. I absolutely totally disagree with what you’re doing to our kids graduation! But::: why in the world would you make this announcement in the middle of spring finals?
Many of your teachers were not equipped to teach this way and it has been a challenging semester for many students. Then you add to it by making this announcement as our kids are preparing end-of-the-seme
ster assignments and taking finals.","I truly don’t understand how you can make this decision when it is still three months away. Does that mean that the fall semester will be online too? Because the first day is only two weeks after the rescheduled graduation...

It isn’t fair that you jumped to this conclusion so quickly. So many of us have worked so hard for this degree. We deserve to have it in person...no matter what it takes!",As a Texas State alumni::: I would gladly postpone my graduation in order to ensure the safety of my family and fellow students. Thank you TXST Admin.,"Beside profits being much higher than the real education offered::: such action like this speaks even louder. To take such an event/
experience from thousands is criminal. I am one disappointed Alumni. Congratulations
to all grads!!",So incredibly disappointed in TEXAS STATE. #1 you announced this during freaking finals what the heck. #2 August is so far away and you make the decision now you could have easily waited until mid July to early July. Just unbelievable and cannot believe Texas state did this. Y’all could do it at the stadium or so where else. Just so disappointed in this school.,It's not like they are denying their degree! I don't like it::: but I also didn't like them canceling South By Southwest at the time::: but it proved to be a life saver since all of the virus didn't come to Austin from around the world. I'm proud of my son and accomplishment and love my school. I'll just take him to Grins and float down the river::: SWT style...,Very bad decision making on making this announcement in the middle of finals. I am a Spring 2020 graduate and received the announcement as I was taking my last final. A time that I’m supposed to be feeling happy and accomplished and that was stripped away. I don’t understand how you can make this decision when the event is 3 months away. I worked hard for years and now I’m unable to do the one thing every graduate looks forward to. I’m very disappointed.,Yet they have no problem accepting the fees paid this semester (almost 2000$) that are in addition to tuition for facilities and amenities that cannot be used. Paying back or *portion* of parking passes is simply not enough. I feel parents and students should start a lawsuit because of this. If I were enrolled this spring semester::: I would be seeking every single legal action I believed I had a genuine fight against. That’s A LOT of money from each person and is a form of THEFT. This is a lot of distrust they are choosing to set themselves bound for.,TEXAS STATE- If you are cancelling graduation in August then WHY are you scheduling face to face classes for the second summer session in July. Rethink it. July will not be safe either and students deserve the option of online classes in July.,this ceremony can be special if you give me a tuition reimbursement,Hi! Texas State Senior here: can we move graduation to Bobcat Stadium? Please?,I’ve paid so much money for my degree and looked forward to this day my whole life. I’ve busted my butt::: graduating with honors and feel the university should reconsider this decision closer to the time of the event. Why not have it outside at the football stadium?,"Still waiting for some refund back for having my son attend online classes. Students and parents should not pay full price for online classes.

I feel bad for the class of 2020. Online graduation takes away from all that the students hard work over the years.
They could have an outdoor graduation at bobcat stadium and by alphabetical time slots.","I can’t believe you would do this to my SON and student’s:::they have worked so hard to get this moment.VERY DISAPPOINTING
Texas State has the outdoors stadium to be able to do there:::Texas State is canceling 3 months before.
VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!
!!!
Heartbroken parents",Not the best decision there could have been more options also considering that summer classes are taking place during the second half and so inconsiderate to announce this during finals week. I hope Texas State reconsiders or does more than this!,Refund this previous semesters fees and tuition. That’ll make it a “special experience to honor our graduates”,If Texas State going to do this to us Students a gofundme should be created to raise money to rent out Bobcat Stadium for us students to walk across,I don’t have a graduating student this year but I really think TXST could do better than this. The graduates deserve better. It’s disappointing.,You think they could have pushed graduation back to the fall or planned ahead. Texas State University wants to continue traditional learning (in the classroom) for the summer 2 and fall semester. You would think if they believe they can somehow make it safe for all the students to return to campus in crowded classrooms to learn they could push graduation back and make it safe as well. After every class you can have 30 up to 200 new students in every room. Combine that with crowded walkaways and hallways but for txst that is safe. 🤦🏻‍♂️ It's all about 💰 they don't want to refund or decrease our tuition costs.,"At least do something to honor the graduates::: TXST. You have not done anything but send out one email to the student body::: pretty much saying “sorry::: but no graduation.”

A&M put their grads names across the field at Kyle Field::: made so many videos and more.

This is a sad time::: and this message doesn’t seem so heartfelt.","Good decision. Huge events such as this take several months of planning::: etc and apparently with the way that things are with the number of COVID19 cases continuing to rise (and most likely will get even worse now that TX is opening too soon) I completely agree with TXST’s decision.
My daughter is supposed to graduate in December 2020. I will not be surprised if her graduation is done virtually as well.
It will not diminish the hard work that she has put forth and all of her accomplishments
(graduating in 3.5 years::: Dean’s List every semester::: etc).
I’ve already talked to her about the possibility and she’s fine and understanding if it does happen that it’s just virtual.
And like what someone else said::: this will go down in history and I believe will be more memorable than the “traditional” graduations.

CONGRATULATIONS
to all the Spring 2020::: Summer 2020 graduates and most likely December 2020 graduates too!",Well President Trauth::: you have heard the consensus of your students and their parents! If grocery stores and restaurants and big businesses and small businesses are having to go out of their way to resume business at 25 % capacity and by all means::: it's costing them a pretty penny::: then I'm sure the school can make some type of arrangement using your stadium outdoors::: having several smaller ceremonies::: having everyone wear masks::: limiting amount of family members::: distance seating::: etc.::: etc. Where there is a will::: there is a way! These young adults are depending on the older::: wiser adults in a crisis like this! Let's be there for them. You can also hold a virtual commencement for those who do not feel comfortable at this time to partake.,This is terrible. I do not believe for a second you exhausted every option. Period. Inexcusable.,Thank you for making this decision TXST! Nothing is worth jeopardizing our health and well-being. -A 2020 graduate,TX State needs to take all the money from those fees they charge for athletics::: labs::: etc that were not used since the students were at home and just plan several ceremonies to accommodate the students and social distancing!!!! You gladly take the tuition money every year and we paid every penny out of pocket. No loans::: no financial aid!!!! My daughter deserves a ceremony after all her hard work. Hold 8 ceremonies instead of 3! Whatever it takes!!!,So::: fall classes are to be held in person::: but not commencement?,Based on my experience in dealing with TXST::: this is not surprising at all. Sending all the hugs to graduating seniors! Congrats on such a huge accomplishment!,"We are in shock...... This can not be ALL they get!!!! Let them Walk with the December Graduation??? This 2020 Class deserves all of the Celebration of completing under the unusual finish and DID ALL THIS UNIVERSITY HAS ASKED OF THEM!!!! I WANT THE DEAN TO KNOW YOU::: as my Daughter said::: YOU DEEPLY HURT HER HEART AND FEELS BETRAYED BY HER UNIVERSITY SHE LOVES😭 for the idea of a "" Virtual"" Graduation to be ALL::: This UNIVERSITY CAN DO BETTER AND MUST.....Class of 2020 deserves their celebration they have worked for it. And I WANT HER CAP AND GOWN SHE COULD NOT PICK UP IN APRIL!!!!! I still need to get Graduation pictures made for her::: something else delayed bc of the obvious. COVID 19.",Texas State University y’all could have an outdoor graduation at the football stadium parking lot. Have the grads sit 6 feet apart from one another::: and the families stay in their vehicles. Would have to have multiple ceremonies::: but it would be worth it. Graduation day from TXST was the highlight of my young adulthood. I can’t imagine not being able to celebrate my achievement. People are still having graduation ceremonies for basic training::: while adhering to the 6 foot rule. Not sure why y’all couldn’t.,"Meanwhile public high schools who dont make money from people are having graduations at AT&T Stadium::: Globe Life Field..etc
And we have Bobcat Stadium but our kids cant have a graduation because Texas State has exhausted all leads??? Doubtful and disappointing.","FIGURE. SOMETHING. OUT!!!!
You can’t just take the easy way out!! It is not fair for these students that worked so hard to not have the opportunity to walk or somehow get recognized! Other colleges in TEXAS are doing something. DO. IT!!!!!

If our district can hand over 7:::500 chrome books for students to use for online learning::: if I can hand out 800+ personal belongings to students at a school.
YOU CAN TOO!!!","Are we going to be refunded for a cap and gown and invitations?!?!
?","This is so sad..daughter has worked so hard to do this then doesn't get to walk..hoping you will reconsider this..spread it out in smaller groups..campus is huge.outdoor will work....these kids have worked so hard not to walk..been dreaming of this for years..Heartbro
ken graduate and parent",Wow 4 years of hard work and not to mention a huge expense to just cancel it for good. Disgusted by this decision. So disappointed in my university,"If you are truly doing this in the best interest of students and families::: then do right by them. Make a swift decision that honors their accomplishments
and TXST traditions.",Hey Texas State::: how about at least giving each graduate a tassel and a few gifts? It's the least you could do. 🙄,"To those complaining about not having a ""real"" ceremony. Is that more important than the wellbeing of the students and family? Really. Perhaps ""all that money"" you claim you or your kids spent::: does not buy common sense.",Thank you for protecting everyone. I know that this has been a tough decision::: but::: it is for everyone’s safety.,"You can bring back face to face instruction for Summer II classes::: but cancel the graduation ceremonies! IN AUGUST! Makes me 😡angry. After all the money that I have paid this university!

And the High schools for MISD are having their graduation ceremonies in JUNE at Globe Life Field.",It is heartbreaking BUT::: they got what they trully worked for::: a diploma::: a career::: financial opportunity::: a living. It is something no one can deny or take away. Congrats Grads!,"No commencement but this is happening...

Carnival Cruise Lines Will Resume Service On August 1st",Any other graduates down to just get together on our commencement dates and walk anyways??,But Summer II classes are in-person? That doesn’t make sense.,I went to Texas State to earn a degree not jump in the river or walk across a stage.,"I've waited my intire life for my daughter's graduation from college into medshool. How dare you take this opportunity from her::: she called yesterday crying severely upset frantic and mad too::: this has been a great atrocity on your faculties failures and incompetence to maintain a safe invirement from day one not only during Coronavirus but during her freshman year students contracted meningitis fell out of windows vandalized students cars plus other were raped on campus with little to no concern to you or your facility or security.
I feel that a class action law suit is now a clear solution to your inadequacies and failures as a a dean::: plus the hurt and scares that are now left in these young children will never be forgotten or left unturned your college will suffer a great lose of registration in the future years to come unless you make this right","Graduating daughters comment::: ""It's no big deal::: just the culmination of my entire life up to now."" Think about it:::::: these kids work hard in high school to get into college:::::: succeed::: work hard at college..and this. There has to be another way..","I still love you TX State!

We are missing multiple traditions at my university in Virginia due to the pandemic::: and at this point I’m just hoping to graduate this year to be able to work.",Proud of my Alma Mater for making the safest decision possible!,"So disappointing!!
Of course the experience will be diminished!! Hell::: all of that hard work::: sweat::: tears and effort is greatly diminished because now these students DON’T HAVE THE HONOR OF WALKING THE STAGE::: WEARING THEIR EARNED SASHES!!!! Real nice Texas Effin’ State!! 🤬🤬",Terrible decision..will they be allowed to get their regalia now and not have it caneled!!!::: couldn't even take grad pictures because they canceled order,Honestly though just be glad there’s a “ceremony” at all. Whether it’s in person or virtual you still worked your butts off and are going to have proof of your efforts. The school really doesn’t have to do this at all.,Of course the experience is diminished. A zoom conference to celebrate my degree? No thank you.,This is such a slap in the face for all these hard working students that worked their behinds off! First generations and so much more! Yes the degree is the prize but being able to walk across the stage is a real life experience!! Postpone it to September or October whatever Let them Walk!!,As a senior graduating this semester::: I am more worried about myself and the people I went to school with who are also graduating. I would hate for something to happen to them or anyone else present because we had to walk. Its disheartening but noone could have expected this to last this long.,I'm so sorry love!! You deserve much more than an email and a paper! You have gone above and beyond in your education to not have a ceremony. Our times have changed so drastically that EVERYONE us being affected! Just know that you deserve the best::: and one day you will get it! Keep your chin up girl!,The high schools are having graduations outside... why can't this work?,Be safe then sorry later . I agree with the President it’s to risky.,"I truly feel y’all pulled the trigger too fast on this one.
Other universities are making it work with less space.
Really hope this doesn’t stay final.",A better leader would have made this decision earlier. It would have been easier for the students and their families to accept.,I understand this decision but it it still disappointing. My daughter is graduating. I wanted to order her cap and gown::: and take pictures of her on campus. I postponed ordering it because I thought we would just wait until the summer. Now I wish I had gone ahead and ordered it. This is such a sad ending to the wonderful experience she had at Texas State.,Don’t you think it’s a little early to cancel a ceremony 3 months from now????,As one of the graduates::: I’m not going to disagree about doing a virtual ceremony. Most of my friends at other schools got this and it’s what I expected. However::: why are you guys allowing in person summer classes but cancelling graduation!? If you refuse to hold a graduation ceremony than you should not hold in person classes for a whole month prior to graduation. This deeply upsets me because summer classes can be taken online and are not nearly as important as celebrating 4+ years of hard work and money put towards this university,This is so unfair!! Especially since summer II will be resuming face to face classes during this exact time frame!,I’m so disappointed. Are they going to cancel the fall semester too then?? It makes no sense as to why graduation should be cancelled so prematurely. Y’all need to come up with a better solution than a virtual ceremony. Do better.,Passed on graduation dinners during undergrad to save it for my MHA only to get hit with this. Well if it’s for the greater cause then so be it.,Other universities have already held virtual commencements for the Spring. Can you please do something next week so we can honor our graduates?,From a former graduate::: and parent of an RN::: people complaining about this need to get a refund::: parents included.,I hope the university reconsiders their decision. After all of their hard work::: our graduates deserve better than this virtual nonsense.,yet y’all still plan to throw 200+ students in a classroom together everyday::: multiple times a day in August? y’all took all the money from some of us for up to 4 years::: and now we’re just getting disposed with no recognition. don’t worry::: I’ll take all my dean’s list honors and my diploma and I’ll be on my way. I’ll remember just how texas state really thought of us seniors::: shame on y’all.,Let them walk the stage with parents ::: brothers and sisters present. We’re waiting for this moment. Please could you reconsider this decision.,To make summer 2020 courses at Texas State as accessible as possible while ensuring the continued safety of our students::: faculty::: and staff::: we will move scheduled class sections that start meeting at any point in June to online/remote delivery::: and return to face-to-face and online classroom delivery for the Summer II session (July 6 – August 5). Please note that the decision regarding the Summer II session could change according to public health advice and conditions. (Copied and pasted from TXST’s website),Can you at least open up Sewell so we can jump this weekend?,These students did the work necessary to get the grades for their degrees to better their future...its time Texas State does the same for them! I have two daughters graduating::: it’s their turn!!!#faithoverfear #TXSTgradsrock #doitforthem,Very tough decision and would be criticized no matter what the decision...,Go to BOBCAT OR EVEN ASK UT TO USE DKR SPLIT IT AND ITS OUTSIDE IN THE AUGUST SUN WHICH STUDIES SHOWN KILLS COVID,Meanwhile at SHSU : Commencement will NOT be cancelled::: but the May ceremonies will be postponed until July 30th and July 31st... EARLIER THAN TEXAS STATES WAS,You can hold it outside like most high schools and colleges are doing! It horrible that you are taking this away from them!!!!😡😡😡😡,I know A LOT of tears and sobbing have happened because of this decision.,If this is your reasoning then you need to continue to push the actual graduation Ceremony back. Other Texas colleges and high schools are doing it at this point and so can you! If you can’t; then move it back to September or October. We don’t care when it is::: but our children have the right to walk across the stage with their family watching them! Part of the excitement of graduating from Texas State was the graduation and how it’s always been handled. You cannot just forfeit that! My daughter is going to walk across your stage even if I have to put her in a different ceremony that you have at a later date. She worked nine years going to your school ::: Working full-time::: and staying on the Dean’s list the whole time- and she’s walking across that stage! We do not even know how the state will be in August. You are opening for classes!!! But it is a lazy decision to just cancel graduation instead of continuing to move it back until it can be held. If it takes you two weeks to do a graduation because you need to separate enough people then you do that -you don’t just cancel it. 2020 should be the year that it took you a full month to handle all the graduations or something like that; but it should not be the year that you did NOT have graduations!,I am very upset that we paid a fee associated with graduation::: and my daughter could not even get a cap and gown because she was told they were not ordered. Instead::: the school store gave her the option to purchase one that wasn't even the correct size. She bought it because she/we would like to have pictures::: at least::: since there is no graduation. This is not right.,"As one of these graduates::: my heart is broken for myself as well as all the other students who have busted their butts to get done with their degree and while it's understandable that the public health safety is at risk by holding graduation::: we have a massive billion dollar stadium that can be used as an alternate site at Texas State for commencement ceremonies. Please sign this petition to get the attention of those responsible for this debacle of cancelling graduation so that class of 2020 can rightfully take to the stage!!! I was supposed to graduate with my masters. Don't take this from me Texas State! Don't take this from any of us!

sk tsk!",First health::: then celebration,Y’all are doing online graduations in AUGUST but you’re still doing Cat Camp for Freshman in June? That make NO sense.,Why not have a social distance ceremony at the stadium? Smh,Can they not do smaller groups over several dates and do it outside.?,Just have it home depot or lowes or any of other stores open and packed all the time.,My son is a 2020 Spring Graduate and I think it’s ridiculous that he worked his butt off for seven years to become a Teacher and a Coach (it took so long because he had to work to help care for our family) And now his big day has came and because of the virus you made the decision to cancel graduation walks for the Spring class indefinitely when you could of said I will send your diplomas now and after the vaccines are created we will allow you to walk in the future with other classes if you like!! He is the first in our family to graduate college and he/we have been waiting on this day... y’all are robbing him of this!! Please reconsider and give these kids the option to walk later!! It’s just not fair!!,Where can we get something to remember this... no need for gown since they can't wear it. cap::: tassel::: anything?

Straight A's. I was looking forward to watching her walk across that stage just as much as she was looking forward to it. CBS::: NBC::: ABC:::CNN with their lousy broadcasting has put the fear in everybody that people drive around in their cars w/masks on. Really. These students should be allowed to have their special day. Let people stay home that are afraid,My girlfriend didn’t go through 4 years of endless stress and work::: all while paying YOU money::: just to hold this ceremony over some measly zoom call. That is so disrespectful to all the graduates,"As a proud Bobcat parent it makes me very disheartened to say that I am NOT at all proud of TXST for deciding NOT to honor your graduates with a ceremony!

My daughter has given 5 hard years of her life to you and is now feeling deflated and heartbroken by your decision.

As a child who was raised without a father::: she was fortunate to have a very loving and supportive Grandfather in her life. There was nothing he wanted more than to see his granddaughter walk the stage as a college graduate. Unfortunately her Grandfather succomed to Stage 4 brain::: lung and bone cancer this last September. She struggled to continue with school through this loss but always said she was determined to walk the stage with ""I did it Grandpa"" bedazzled on her cap to honor him::: knowing that he would be so very proud of her. That thought kept her hanging on to get through her last semesters.

Now you've made a decision to NOT allow her this and it is beyond sad to hear her speak of a university she was so proud to be a part of like it was just another thing in her life that let her down.

Local Texas high schools and our governor have decided to resume in person classes this August::: yet you can't seem to reverse your decision to allow your graduates to walk that stage so that their families can celebrate this huge honor with them. I honestly think it's disgusting that you have no problem taking our money for five years but can't take a few hours out of your time to honor our children!

I know I am not alone in my thoughts as I signed a petition that was circulated by one of your students that had already gained over 8000 signatures by the time I signed it.

There are hundreds of ways you could alter the ceremonies to aid in social distancing measures::: ways in which I'm sure most people would be more than willing to deal with. Since our governor has lifted restrictions::: why not leave it up to the decision of the families as to whether or not they choose to attend? After all the hard work these students have put in to earn their degrees::: I would hope that you're not just being lazy by not wanting to make the effort to alter ceremonies in order to allow them to take place.

Come on Texas State University... do the RIGHT thing and reinstate graduation ceremonies that were due to take place this fall",DUMB! DUMB! DUMB! I want to know how they came to this conclusion 3 months in advance. They aren’t even giving the seniors a chance!!,All of the students worked so hard and the only option you can come up with is to cancel it. There’s got to be something that can be done. You have huge outdoor stadiums and other rooms that could be used. Please reconsider😡!!!!,"President Trauth::: I hope you see this post. My daughter is a Senior::: or at least she thought she was until today! You see she changed her major a couple of years ago. She faithfully met with advisors going into every semester so that she was on track to graduate p. Our family does not have a lot of money and she has worked 3 jobs while taking 15-18 credit hours each semester. She is even on the Deans List. At the start of this school year she was not told that a class she needed was only offered in the fall. That did not stop her::: she met with the professor and on top of her load he let her do an independent study as she was already working for the City of San Marcos promoting downtown. She is short 1 class that she was going to take in the fall but she was told that she could participate in the graduation ceremony for summer. Our family made plans::: took off work::: reserved hotels. Now you are not having a graduation::: it was a let down but we still kept our plans to watch whatever virtual ceremony there is going to be. But now she received a message that she can not participate! I called her counselor
S office::: the commencement office and your office for an explanation. WHY WOULD YOU CHANGE THE POLICY 4 WEEKS BEFORE GRADUATION!! I can’t believe this! I will no longer recommend TEXAS STATE to anyone! I hate myself because I already convinced my niece and nephew to go and it is to late to change. You obviously do not care about these students::: you have already gotten their money and now feel that you can just throw them away. I guess it is true that people feel UT and A&M are higher quality schools::: you are definitely proving that!","https://

If other TX schools can hold a graduation ceremony IN PERSON::: so can we! The cofounder of EVO is even offering to hold graduation ceremonies FOR FREE at their Kyle and other location.

In addition::: the least we could do is hold a separate ceremony for each individual department...","👨‍🎓👩‍🎓Just spoke to a parent of a graduating 2020 OU student and a 2020 Tech student. The schools decided early on to do virtual for May and in person in August - they could choose to do one or both. Texas State DID NOT come up with the best solution for these students that have worked their tails off for 4 years and gave thousands of dollars to the school - to do a Virtual graduation and to look at what - The President or Dean's speak for a hour? OU's virtual::: apparently you had to find the 13 second link that announced your name. There are many other ways to figure this out::: and YES::: Texas State this may cost you thousand of dollars to spread out the 6:::000 graduates with their families AND still protect the Bobcat family and San Marcos community. Unfortunately::: it makes it very hard to feel your sincere and heartfelt congratulations
when you and the team of individuals came together to make a decision based on facts that you truly don't have for the upcoming August commencement. This virus::: along with the flu and every other sickness is going to be around for awhile -\-\ eliminating the May commencement was a heartbreak::: but took it as it was in the midst of state shutdowns::: etc....BUT to go ahead and make a decision AGAIN to eliminate in August when the state is opening businesses::: restaurants::: etc. -\-\ let the 2020 Graduating Class and their families decide if they want to attend either by Virtual or In-Person::: they have earned this right to do so. A solution::: someone mentioned is needed and plenty of individuals have commented on excellent solutions. So re-collaborate and come up with a solution to spend the money that these graduates have given you all these years (as there is probably a way to turn it in to the Government); give THEM the option to have an In-Person commencement in May::: August or December (spread it out - and I'm sure some would still make a May date); can't have it indoors::: have it at the stadium that seats 30:::000 people (more than enough room). There ARE excellent solutions -\-\ I personally DO NOT feel like ya'll exhausted every possible scenario especially when other universities seem to have found other ways to honor their graduates!

He is the first in our family to graduate college and he/we have been waiting on this day... y’all are robbing him of this!! Please reconsider and give these kids the option to walk later!!

"TXST is proud to announce that the Bobcat Promise program has been expanded to support an even greater number of Texas families and students who are facing financial uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Bobcat Promise will now reach thousands of more incoming Bobcats who have a family adjusted gross income (AGI) that does not exceed $50:::000 annually. This is a substantial increase from the previous limit of $35:::000.

The program will provide undergraduate tuition & fees to eligible fall 2020 freshmen who meet the AGI qualification::: and who submitted their FASFA and were admitted to Texas State by March 15.

TXST will continue making greats strides in our efforts to ensure college is accessible for all Bobcats who need the support.

"An announcement from Dr. Gene Bourgeois::: Provost and VP for Academic Affairs::: about Summer 2020 Courses and Summer/Fall 2020 Registration:

I hope everyone is doing well and adapting to remote and alternative course delivery for the spring semester. Texas State University is here to support our current and future Bobcats during this time of disruption. I’m pleased to announce today that we are providing emergency financial aid and adjusting the delivery of Summer I courses to better meet your needs during the COVID-19 crisis.

To make summer 2020 courses at Texas State as accessible as possible while ensuring the continued safety of our students::: faculty::: and staff::: we will move scheduled class sections that start meeting at any point in June to online/remote delivery::: and return to face-to-face and online classroom delivery for the Summer II session (July 6 – August 5). Please note that the decision regarding the Summer II session could change according to public health advice and conditions.

Making the decision now to move Summer I to online/remote delivery gives you the ability to plan accordingly for the future during these still uncertain times::: and allows students to continue toward reaching their educational goals.

I want to be clear: Summer courses are not canceled::: only moved to online/remote delivery for the Summer I session.

Registration for the Summer and Fall 2020 semesters will open on April 6::: 2020.

Here is what you need to know about moving Summer I courses to online/remote delivery:

- Financial aid processing is not directly affected. Remember: The Pell Grant is available for summer classes based on student eligibility.

- Students will be awarded emergency financial aid of $50 per semester credit hour.

In addition::: New Student Orientation sessions will be held virtually this summer. We will provide more information soon about how to participate.

Thank you for your patience as we find the best solutions to help keep you safe and your academic pursuits moving forward.

"A message from Dr. Gene Bourgeois::: Provost and VP for Academic Affairs::: about Spring 2020 Final Grades:

As part of the transition to remote instruction for the spring 2020 semester::: Texas State University will make a temporary change to the final grades policy. This change will provide students with the option to request modification of final course grades to the “EP” (emergency pass) grades. The modification request may only be utilized for courses in which the student earned a passing grade. See the University Registrar’s definition of grades: https://www.registrar.txstate.edu/our-services/grades.html.

The decision to allow this flexibility is in direct response to the unprecedented situation created by COVID-19. The university’s remote courses will continue to maintain the highest quality standards. Students are expected to participate in class activities::: assessments::: and assignments throughout the remainder of the semester. As usual::: faculty members will assign final grades to students using the criteria and performance standards outlined for the course.

Once final spring 2020 semester grades are posted::: students will have until Monday::: May 25::: 2020 to submit a written modification request to their professor(s) requesting an EP grade. Upon approval::: the professor will make the grade change. To be considered::: all requests must be made in writing to the professor by the stated deadline. The modification request option is limited to spring 2020 courses only. Students make requests on a course-by-course basis.

Students are encouraged to consider the consequences of an EP grade::: including those for prerequisite course requirements::: GPA calculations::: GPA minimums for certain programs::: academic standing::: admission to other programs or universities::: financial aid::: veteran’s benefits::: scholarships::: and other academic matters. Students should contact their academic advisor or academic program coordinator for specific questions. Graduate students are strongly encouraged to consult with their graduate advisor about the impacts of an EP grade before seeking a modification request.

Faculty members are encouraged to be flexible but have the authority to make their own decisions on these requests. Decisions by faculty members are due by Friday::: May 29::: 2020. Faculty will use the Change of Grade Web Application for making grade changes to EP: https://tim.txstate.edu/changeofgrade/.

Students may appeal a faculty member’s decision using the procedures outlined for the department::: school::: or college in which the course is taught. The appeal process is applicable for all grades::: including those under review by this temporary change to the final grades policy.

I realize this has not been an easy transition and thank you for your patience and understanding as we assess options and make decisions in the best interest of the university community.",3/31/2020 22:12,Ashtyn Landry,Can you post cliff notes for this::: I’m confused,My daughter attends Texas State and as a parent and alumni of Texas State this infuriates me!!This is absolutely ridiculous! Is there anyway to overturn this decision? This makes no sense at all! And why is it up to the discretion of the professor?,I was just informed by two professors you don’t receive credit for the class if you choose to have it graded as an emergency pass. Why did you guys fail to mention this? This is nothing like pass/fail and you’re deliberately confusing your students. Students are asking for pass/fail like other universities have done. If UT Austin has moved to pass/fail then why has Texas State failed to?,Joey Smith,Jonathan Rivera,As an alumni still involved with sorority life at TXST::: I was disappointed to learn that not all instructors are being held to the same type of instruction. I think it should have been mandatory for staff to use the same platform for online instruction to create an equal playing field versus students having to learn how every professor is going to now operate. I think its a disservice to our students.,Are the lives of your library employees not important to you? Close your library!,I don’t understand what difference it makes if you’re already passing the class. Am I missing something?,Trey Cardenas,So???? 🤔🤔,Jonathan Aguilera,Cameron Mccartney,"What was the point of even implementing this system? There is literally virtually no difference between this and adopting any sort of change to the grading. This is NOT pass/fail and is a terrible excuse for a middle ground. Take a look at St. Edward’s University’s policy for pass/fail. This is the policy that every other university has been following.

✉️ registrar@txstate.edu",3/28/2020 2:42,I just have to say that the academic advising for my freshman has been poor. I do not get involved because this is part of college but I do know that last fall and currently he has jumped through numerous hoops just to get an appointment. Sorry but that’s the truth. Very disappointed. He is told by professions to sign up for class “A” but then class A isn’t offered. He emails the professor and the academic advisor with no response.,Alec S Belcher,Margaret. Samantha,Allison See,Chad Harvey,Thank you Texas State for making sure that students did not have to worry about registration at the same time that many are trying to get out of dorms and everyone adjusts to all online classes! Decisions that affect thousands are hard to make. I'm so impressed with the care the university has for its students and how well informed they're keeping everyone!,Felycitie Haney,Alec S Belcher,Juan J Martinez,Monica Closner Mercado,Robert Jimenez Jr.,Trey Garza Homer Garza Cecilia Garza,Avery Rushing,Jordan Delgado,Rolando Vasquez,Ashlynn Sauceda,Danielle Armendariz,Matthew Garza,Lanette Moncada,Laura Richardson,Alyssa Villarreal,Hector Crow,Destiny Sanchez,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

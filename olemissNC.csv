Please take this feedback as a way to improve and educate your staff to treat ALL students with dignity and respect. I may be the one serving this country but my son was the one left behind while I was serving away from home. So yes::: he also earned the GI Bill that I passed down to him. If the staff has an issue with that decision then they are working in the wrong office. Stay humble and kind always!,A plan and dream come true! Thrilled for our military students and staff!

My daughter and I no longer have access to our olemiss.edu account,Is there any way that the class of 2020 can graduate on a Saturday? It’s not fair that the graduation for some students is on a Friday (May 8th). It’s a new year and a lot of students are now in graduate school or have accepted new jobs or have other life commitments through the week. My brother is in graduate school now and he has a huge final exam on May 8th::: which is his scheduled graduation day for Ole Miss for undergraduate degree. COVID-19 has affected so many people but it should not in any way deter or cause any inconveniences for the graduates. They worked so hard and it’s just not fair. My brother loves his time at Ole Miss so why should he not be able to make his graduation? It’s very inconsiderate timing.

Not that her no show performance was any better than the others we mentioned. But because she had the audacity to say at the final exam review for this class:  “Your success isn’t because you or your parents worked hard. It’s because you or they got lucky”.  Oh...so we send our kids to college::: telling them to work hard. But according to this hack of a professor we are stupid to encourage hard work because success is only a matter of luck. Ok Willa - go back to your socialist hole now.  Curiously::: several years ago Dr. Willa Wonka was an associate professor of religion. The last time I checked the Bible mentioned the value of work ethic. I don’t recall much about getting lucky. But what does an Episcopalian know?  Below is a message from one of Ole Willa’s students. Shoot her an email to let know what you think of her horrific philosophy btw. This is for Soc 101  “First and foremost::: she didn’t hold zooms. She had discussions every now and then which she would “cancel” because she felt “sick”. The one time I went on::: she argued with a student that he was wrong on the nature vs nurture debate the whole time. She also failed us considering every test score/ journal grade. She would send out a list of student ID numbers with their grades attached and from what it looked like 3-5 people passed out of 40+ students each time. I can say I wrote notes::: read each chapter::: even defied vocabulary but still managed to get below a 30 on a test::: most likely because of my views. One thing that stuck with me was that she said on our only final exam review: “your success isn’t because you or your parents worked hard. It’s because they got lucky” Not sure what she meant by that when I know adults across the nation work every hour they can to be able to give their child what they want and need in life.”,Our Hotty Toddy tree in Bell Buckle TN!

This is a joke.,Love Doc's tie! ;) #HDT,The new flag is pretty but still disgusted that you had to change it Giving in again,Great flag for a fireplace starter!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥,Not saying I have a problem with an updated flag::: but that one looks more like a flag a 75 year old grandma would have hanging in her garden mixed in with figurines of bunnies::: squirrels::: etc.::: rather than an official flag of a state. I'll be sticking with the Stennis flag at my house.,Love the flag but not going to make everyone happy.,This pretty much sums it up.,So much progress!,Like it. The magnolia is such an awsome flower,Now get rid of the name Rebels and Ole Miss. Also::: remove that John Vaught statue and remove the name from the stadium due to him refusing to recruit any married or African American players.,Boy it sure didn’t take long to get it out up,Looks beautiful. Wasn’t the design I wanted (I liked the Stennis Flag the most)::: but man I think now seeing it hung up at my school makes me just so happy::: it’s starting to grow on me.  Also for those angry that the old flag got taken down::: you voted for the representatives that removed it. You don’t vote on all of Trumps decisions::: either. You had the chance on the ballot to vote no and you clearly were in the minority. Stop being “snowflakes”.,I just don’t care for the yellow stripes. And when I say don’t care for I’m being nice. Mississippi isn’t yellow! Red white and blue the whole way through!!! I do like “In God we Trust”.,Nope put back the old flag,Yelp just like GA did,Great flag ❤️❤️ all you old people tryna keep that racist stuff alive it’s gone die right alone with you in hell ❤️ NEW MISS PROUD TO BE AN ALUMNI,So!

If there is something you don’t like::: you can throw a fit::: break the rules and destroy whatever it is that you don’t like. People you need to think about the lesson you are teaching. We have professors that are allowed to throw temper tantrums and use disgusting language in a very public forum. I truly fear for the future of our state and our country.

How is a graduation ceremony okay but in person classes are not?!? I see logic is not taught at Ole Miss.,Debra Gachot,This is great! I don't have a Senior::: but I'm glad to see some in person events happening. Hoping this means my Freshman will have some in person classes then for Spring semester!,Seriously some of you need a real dose of reality. It is a pandemic::: over 200:::000 people have died and yea I know you are young and think you are Teflon coated but they can't please everyone. Does it really matter which class goes first. I mean did we not get over being first in Kindergarten? They are trying to keep everyone safe and I am sure trying to make it so as many as want to can participate but you have to be at least a bit flexible.,Aww I hope I get to walk! It’s hard to plan this when it’s a year later::: but I’m glad we finally get an in person!

If some classes need to remain online - fine::: but give the students a choice to sign up for in-person or online. Online should not be the only option. Hybrid is fine too as long as it doesn't change mid-semester to online.,Thank you,It is a travesty that UM will not go back to full in class settings for the spring of 2021. It is a tragedy that students will again::: self teach self schedule and not interact with their peers and their “proctors” in a classroom setting. I refuse to call them professors as they sit at home whiling away their days having posted the schedule of assignments and exams.. this is no longer “The University of Mississippi”. It has become SNHU::: an online degree Mill.,Thank you!,Please explain your reasoning why the Class of 2021 gets to graduate before the Class of 2020.,I would just be thankful that my 2020 graduate was getting a ceremony and leave it at that. 🙂,Molly-Caitlyn Armitage Stephanie Gleason,Kristen Faith,Taranique Brown,Mark yo calendar it’s my time to shine Lauren Holt Kalen Hester,Hotty Toddy❤️💙,Thank you 🙏🏼,Peyton Moore,Madison McCay Alexandra McGinnis Aly Card Marisa Patterson,Becky Robinson,I’m very disappointed the 2021 date was changed for this graduation!! 2021 already had plans maybe you should have put 2020 the weekend before!!!

But I’m sure others will have more difficulties!,Yes 🙌🏼,Will this be a shared ceremony with the class of ‘21?,GO REBS 🍒🍒🍒🍒🍒,So we/re moving 2021 to a week earlier and we're postponing 2020 for a YEAR?

When they haven’t even figured out exactly how they’re going to keep OUR children safe! I don’t believe going back is in the best interest for anyone at this point.

However::: having decided to move the statue are we now going to go through all the books on campus to remove any mention of the confederate or the history thereof? Hiding it only leads to the belief that what happened in that time in our history was something to be ashamed of as apposed to learn from. There were hero’s who fought with valor to protect what they believed was right. History is the best teacher.,I am a Tennessee fan but want to say Don't bow to the mob,Cowards::: all of you,Tell your big tough sissy football team to grow some stones and quit worrying about some statue that’s supposedly offending people Your getting a free ride to school to play some stupid game that means absolutely nothing in the realm of things,Well Chancellor Boyce the left was right for once.They should have never hired you.You should change your name to Neville Chamberlain,I loved being at Ole Miss from 2015 to 2019.
